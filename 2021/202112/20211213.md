### 1.Label, Verify, Correct: A Simple Few Shot Object Detection Method  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05749.pdf)
>  The objective of this paper is few-shot object detection (FSOD) -- the task of expanding an object detector for a new category given only a few instances for training. We introduce a simple pseudo-labelling method to source high-quality pseudo-annotations from the training set, for each new category, vastly increasing the number of training instances and reducing class imbalance; our method finds previously unlabelled instances. NaÃ¯vely training with model predictions yields sub-optimal performance; we present two novel methods to improve the precision of the pseudo-labelling process: first, we introduce a verification technique to remove candidate detections with incorrect class labels; second, we train a specialised model to correct poor quality bounding boxes. After these two novel steps, we obtain a large set of high-quality pseudo-annotations that allow our final detector to be trained end-to-end. Additionally, we demonstrate our method maintains base class performance, and the utility of simple augmentations in FSOD. While benchmarking on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO, our method achieves state-of-the-art or second-best performance compared to existing approaches across all number of shots.      
### 2.More Control for Free! Image Synthesis with Semantic Diffusion Guidance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05744.pdf)
>  Controllable image synthesis models allow creation of diverse images based on text instructions or guidance from an example image. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been shown to generate more realistic imagery than prior methods, and have been successfully demonstrated in unconditional and class-conditional settings. We explore fine-grained, continuous control of this model class, and introduce a novel unified framework for semantic diffusion guidance, which allows either language or image guidance, or both. Guidance is injected into a pretrained unconditional diffusion model using the gradient of image-text or image matching scores. We explore CLIP-based textual guidance as well as both content and style-based image guidance in a unified form. Our text-guided synthesis approach can be applied to datasets without associated text annotations. We conduct experiments on FFHQ and LSUN datasets, and show results on fine-grained text-guided image synthesis, synthesis of images related to a style or content example image, and examples with both textual and image guidance.      
### 3.Neural Belief Propagation for Scene Graph Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05727.pdf)
>  Scene graph generation aims to interpret an input image by explicitly modelling the potential objects and their relationships, which is predominantly solved by the message passing neural network models in previous methods. Currently, such approximation models generally assume the output variables are totally independent and thus ignore the informative structural higher-order interactions. This could lead to the inconsistent interpretations for an input image. In this paper, we propose a novel neural belief propagation method to generate the resulting scene graph. It employs a structural Bethe approximation rather than the mean field approximation to infer the associated marginals. To find a better bias-variance trade-off, the proposed model not only incorporates pairwise interactions but also higher order interactions into the associated scoring function. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various popular scene graph generation benchmarks.      
### 4.VUT: Versatile UI Transformer for Multi-Modal Multi-Task User Interface Modeling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05692.pdf)
>  User interface modeling is inherently multimodal, which involves several distinct types of data: images, structures and language. The tasks are also diverse, including object detection, language generation and grounding. In this paper, we present VUT, a Versatile UI Transformer that takes multimodal input and simultaneously accomplishes 5 distinct tasks with the same model. Our model consists of a multimodal Transformer encoder that jointly encodes UI images and structures, and performs UI object detection when the UI structures are absent in the input. Our model also consists of an auto-regressive Transformer model that encodes the language input and decodes output, for both question-answering and command grounding with respect to the UI. Our experiments show that for most of the tasks, when trained jointly for multi-tasks, VUT substantially reduces the number of models and footprints needed for performing multiple tasks, while achieving accuracy exceeding or on par with baseline models trained for each individual task.      
### 5.A Deep Learning Based Automated Hand Hygiene Training System  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05667.pdf)
>  Hand hygiene is crucial for preventing viruses and infections. Due to the pervasive outbreak of COVID-19, wearing a mask and hand hygiene appear to be the most effective ways for the public to curb the spread of these viruses. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a guideline for alcohol-based hand rub in eight steps to ensure that all surfaces of hands are entirely clean. As these steps involve complex gestures, human assessment of them lacks enough accuracy. However, Deep Neural Network (DNN) and machine vision have made it possible to accurately evaluate hand rubbing quality for the purposes of training and feedback. In this paper, an automated deep learning based hand rub assessment system with real-time feedback is presented. The system evaluates the compliance with the 8-step guideline using a DNN architecture trained on a dataset of videos collected from volunteers with various skin tones and hand characteristics following the hand rubbing guideline. Various DNN architectures were tested, and an Inception-ResNet model led to the best results with 97% test accuracy. In the proposed system, an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier embedded board runs the software. The efficacy of the system is evaluated in a concrete situation of being used by various users, and challenging steps are identified. In this experiment, the average time taken by the hand rubbing steps among volunteers is 27.2 seconds, which conforms to the WHO guidelines.      
### 6.Mask-invariant Face Recognition through Template-level Knowledge Distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05646.pdf)
>  The emergence of the global COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges for biometrics. Not only are contactless biometric identification options becoming more important, but face recognition has also recently been confronted with the frequent wearing of masks. These masks affect the performance of previous face recognition systems, as they hide important identity information. In this paper, we propose a mask-invariant face recognition solution (MaskInv) that utilizes template-level knowledge distillation within a training paradigm that aims at producing embeddings of masked faces that are similar to those of non-masked faces of the same identities. In addition to the distilled knowledge, the student network benefits from additional guidance by margin-based identity classification loss, ElasticFace, using masked and non-masked faces. In a step-wise ablation study on two real masked face databases and five mainstream databases with synthetic masks, we prove the rationalization of our MaskInv approach. Our proposed solution outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) academic solutions in the recent MFRC-21 challenge in both scenarios, masked vs masked and masked vs non-masked, and also outperforms the previous solution on the MFR2 dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed model can still perform well on unmasked faces with only a minor loss in verification performance. The code, the trained models, as well as the evaluation protocol on the synthetically masked data are publicly available: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/fdbtrs/Masked-Face-Recognition-KD" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 7.Roominoes: Generating Novel 3D Floor Plans From Existing 3D Rooms  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05644.pdf)
>  Realistic 3D indoor scene datasets have enabled significant recent progress in computer vision, scene understanding, autonomous navigation, and 3D reconstruction. But the scale, diversity, and customizability of existing datasets is limited, and it is time-consuming and expensive to scan and annotate more. Fortunately, combinatorics is on our side: there are enough individual rooms in existing 3D scene datasets, if there was but a way to recombine them into new layouts. In this paper, we propose the task of generating novel 3D floor plans from existing 3D rooms. We identify three sub-tasks of this problem: generation of 2D layout, retrieval of compatible 3D rooms, and deformation of 3D rooms to fit the layout. We then discuss different strategies for solving the problem, and design two representative pipelines: one uses available 2D floor plans to guide selection and deformation of 3D rooms; the other learns to retrieve a set of compatible 3D rooms and combine them into novel layouts. We design a set of metrics that evaluate the generated results with respect to each of the three subtasks and show that different methods trade off performance on these subtasks. Finally, we survey downstream tasks that benefit from generated 3D scenes and discuss strategies in selecting the methods most appropriate for the demands of these tasks.      
### 8.HeadNeRF: A Real-time NeRF-based Parametric Head Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05637.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose HeadNeRF, a novel NeRF-based parametric head model that integrates the neural radiance field to the parametric representation of the human head. It can render high fidelity head images in real-time, and supports directly controlling the generated images' rendering pose and various semantic attributes. Different from existing related parametric models, we use the neural radiance fields as a novel 3D proxy instead of the traditional 3D textured mesh, which makes that HeadNeRF is able to generate high fidelity images. However, the computationally expensive rendering process of the original NeRF hinders the construction of the parametric NeRF model. To address this issue, we adopt the strategy of integrating 2D neural rendering to the rendering process of NeRF and design novel loss terms. As a result, the rendering speed of HeadNeRF can be significantly accelerated, and the rendering time of one frame is reduced from 5s to 25ms. The novel-designed loss terms also improve the rendering accuracy, and the fine-level details of the human head, such as the gaps between teeth, wrinkles, and beards, can be represented and synthesized by HeadNeRF. Extensive experimental results and several applications demonstrate its effectiveness. We will release the code and trained model to the public.      
### 9.Seq-Masks: Bridging the gap between appearance and gait modeling for video-based person re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05626.pdf)
>  ideo-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images in video sequences captured by disjoint surveillance cameras. Traditional video-based person Re-ID methods focus on exploring appearance information, thus, vulnerable against illumination changes, scene noises, camera parameters, and especially clothes/carrying variations. Gait recognition provides an implicit biometric solution to alleviate the above headache. Nonetheless, it experiences severe performance degeneration as camera view varies. In an attempt to address these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework that utilizes the sequence masks (SeqMasks) in the video to integrate appearance information and gait modeling in a close fashion. Specifically, to sufficiently validate the effectiveness of our method, we build a novel dataset named MaskMARS based on MARS. Comprehensive experiments on our proposed large wild video Re-ID dataset MaskMARS evidenced our extraordinary performance and generalization capability. Validations on the gait recognition metric CASIA-B dataset further demonstrated the capability of our hybrid model.      
### 10.PERF: Performant, Explicit Radiance Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05598.pdf)
>  We present a novel way of approaching image-based 3D reconstruction based on radiance fields. The problem of volumetric reconstruction is formulated as a non-linear least-squares problem and solved explicitly without the use of neural networks. This enables the use of solvers with a higher rate of convergence than what is typically used for neural networks, and fewer iterations are required until convergence. The volume is represented using a grid of voxels, with the scene surrounded by a hierarchy of environment maps. This makes it possible to get clean reconstructions of 360Â° scenes where the foreground and background is separated. A number of synthetic and real scenes from well known benchmark-suites are successfully reconstructed with quality on par with state-of-the-art methods, but at significantly reduced reconstruction times.      
### 11.Unified Multimodal Pre-training and Prompt-based Tuning for Vision-Language Understanding and Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05587.pdf)
>  Most existing vision-language pre-training methods focus on understanding tasks and use BERT-like objectives (masked language modeling and image-text matching) during pretraining. Although they perform well in many understanding downstream tasks, e.g., visual question answering, image-text retrieval and visual entailment, they do not possess the ability to generate. To tackle this problem, we propose Unified multimodal pre-training for both Vision-Language understanding and generation (UniVL). The proposed UniVL is capable of handling both understanding tasks and generative tasks. We augment existing pretraining paradigms that only use random masks with causal masks, i.e., triangular masks that mask out future tokens, such that the pre-trained models can have autoregressive generation abilities by design. We formulate several previous understanding tasks as a text generation task and propose to use prompt-based method for fine-tuning on different downstream tasks. Our experiments show that there is a trade-off between understanding tasks and generation tasks while using the same model, and a feasible way to improve both tasks is to use more data. Our UniVL framework attains comparable performance to recent vision-language pre-training methods on both understanding tasks and generation tasks. Moreover, we demostrate that prompt-based finetuning is more data-efficient - it outperforms discriminative methods in few-shot scenarios.      
### 12.Discrete neural representations for explainable anomaly detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05585.pdf)
>  The aim of this work is to detect and automatically generate high-level explanations of anomalous events in video. Understanding the cause of an anomalous event is crucial as the required response is dependant on its nature and severity. Recent works typically use object or action classifier to detect and provide labels for anomalous events. However, this constrains detection systems to a finite set of known classes and prevents generalisation to unknown objects or behaviours. Here we show how to robustly detect anomalies without the use of object or action classifiers yet still recover the high level reason behind the event. We make the following contributions: (1) a method using saliency maps to decouple the explanation of anomalous events from object and action classifiers, (2) show how to improve the quality of saliency maps using a novel neural architecture for learning discrete representations of video by predicting future frames and (3) beat the state-of-the-art anomaly explanation methods by 60\% on a subset of the public benchmark X-MAN dataset.      
### 13.GPU-accelerated image alignment for object detection in industrial applications  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05576.pdf)
>  This research proposes a practical method for detecting featureless objects by using image alignment approach with a robust similarity measure in industrial applications. This similarity measure is robust against occlusion, illumination changes and background clutter. The performance of the proposed GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) accelerated algorithm is deemed successful in experiments of comparison between both CPU and GPU implementations      
### 14.Global Attention Mechanism: Retain Information to Enhance Channel-Spatial Interactions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05561.pdf)
>  A variety of attention mechanisms have been studied to improve the performance of various computer vision tasks. However, the prior methods overlooked the significance of retaining the information on both channel and spatial aspects to enhance the cross-dimension interactions. Therefore, we propose a global attention mechanism that boosts the performance of deep neural networks by reducing information reduction and magnifying the global interactive representations. We introduce 3D-permutation with multilayer-perceptron for channel attention alongside a convolutional spatial attention submodule. The evaluation of the proposed mechanism for the image classification task on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K indicates that our method stably outperforms several recent attention mechanisms with both ResNet and lightweight MobileNet.      
### 15.Error Diagnosis of Deep Monocular Depth Estimation Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05533.pdf)
>  Estimating depth from a monocular image is an ill-posed problem: when the camera projects a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, depth information is inherently and permanently lost. Nevertheless, recent work has shown impressive results in estimating 3D structure from 2D images using deep learning. In this paper, we put on an introspective hat and analyze state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models in indoor scenes to understand these models' limitations and error patterns. To address errors in depth estimation, we introduce a novel Depth Error Detection Network (DEDN) that spatially identifies erroneous depth predictions in the monocular depth estimation models. By experimenting with multiple state-of-the-art monocular indoor depth estimation models on multiple datasets, we show that our proposed depth error detection network can identify a significant number of errors in the predicted depth maps. Our module is flexible and can be readily plugged into any monocular depth prediction network to help diagnose its results. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective Depth Error Correction Network (DECN) that iteratively corrects errors based on our initial error diagnosis.      
### 16.CityNeRF: Building NeRF at City Scale  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05504.pdf)
>  Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has achieved outstanding performance in modeling 3D objects and controlled scenes, usually under a single scale. In this work, we make the first attempt to bring NeRF to city-scale, with views ranging from satellite-level that captures the overview of a city, to ground-level imagery showing complex details of an architecture. The wide span of camera distance to the scene yields multi-scale data with different levels of detail and spatial coverage, which casts great challenges to vanilla NeRF and biases it towards compromised results. To address these issues, we introduce CityNeRF, a progressive learning paradigm that grows the NeRF model and training set synchronously. Starting from fitting distant views with a shallow base block, as training progresses, new blocks are appended to accommodate the emerging details in the increasingly closer views. The strategy effectively activates high-frequency channels in the positional encoding and unfolds more complex details as the training proceeds. We demonstrate the superiority of CityNeRF in modeling diverse city-scale scenes with drastically varying views, and its support for rendering views in different levels of detail.      
### 17.Sparse Depth Completion with Semantic Mesh Deformation Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05498.pdf)
>  Sparse depth measurements are widely available in many applications such as augmented reality, visual inertial odometry and robots equipped with low cost depth sensors. Although such sparse depth samples work well for certain applications like motion tracking, a complete depth map is usually preferred for broader applications, such as 3D object recognition, 3D reconstruction and autonomous driving. Despite the recent advancements in depth prediction from single RGB images with deeper neural networks, the existing approaches do not yield reliable results for practical use. In this work, we propose a neural network with post-optimization, which takes an RGB image and sparse depth samples as input and predicts the complete depth map. We make three major contributions to advance the state-of-the-art: an improved backbone network architecture named EDNet, a semantic edge-weighted loss function and a semantic mesh deformation optimization method. Our evaluation results outperform the existing work consistently on both indoor and outdoor datasets, and it significantly reduces the mean average error by up to 19.5% under the same settings of 200 sparse samples on NYU-Depth-V2 dataset.      
### 18.Graph-based Generative Face Anonymisation with Pose Preservation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05496.pdf)
>  We propose AnonyGAN, a GAN-based solution for face anonymisation which replaces the visual information corresponding to a source identity with a condition identity provided as any single image. With the goal to maintain the geometric attributes of the source face, i.e., the facial pose and expression, and to promote more natural face generation, we propose to exploit a Bipartite Graph to explicitly model the relations between the facial landmarks of the source identity and the ones of the condition identity through a deep model. We further propose a landmark attention model to relax the manual selection of facial landmarks, allowing the network to weight the landmarks for the best visual naturalness and pose preservation. Finally, to facilitate the appearance learning, we propose a hybrid training strategy to address the challenge caused by the lack of direct pixel-level supervision. We evaluate our method and its variants on two public datasets, CelebA and LFW, in terms of visual naturalness, facial pose preservation and of its impacts on face detection and re-identification. We prove that AnonyGAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual naturalness, face detection and pose preservation.      
### 19.DronePose: The identification, segmentation, and orientation detection of drones via neural networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05488.pdf)
>  The growing ubiquity of drones has raised concerns over the ability of traditional air-space monitoring technologies to accurately characterise such vehicles. Here, we present a CNN using a decision tree and ensemble structure to fully characterise drones in flight. Our system determines the drone type, orientation (in terms of pitch, roll, and yaw), and performs segmentation to classify different body parts (engines, body, and camera). We also provide a computer model for the rapid generation of large quantities of accurately labelled photo-realistic training data and demonstrate that this data is of sufficient fidelity to allow the system to accurately characterise real drones in flight. Our network will provide a valuable tool in the image processing chain where it may build upon existing drone detection technologies to provide complete drone characterisation over wide areas.      
### 20.Visual Transformers with Primal Object Queries for Multi-Label Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05485.pdf)
>  Multi-label image classification is about predicting a set of class labels that can be considered as orderless sequential data. Transformers process the sequential data as a whole, therefore they are inherently good at set prediction. The first vision-based transformer model, which was proposed for the object detection task introduced the concept of object queries. Object queries are learnable positional encodings that are used by attention modules in decoder layers to decode the object classes or bounding boxes using the region of interests in an image. However, inputting the same set of object queries to different decoder layers hinders the training: it results in lower performance and delays convergence. In this paper, we propose the usage of primal object queries that are only provided at the start of the transformer decoder stack. In addition, we improve the mixup technique proposed for multi-label classification. The proposed transformer model with primal object queries improves the state-of-the-art class wise F1 metric by 2.1% and 1.8%; and speeds up the convergence by 79.0% and 38.6% on MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE datasets respectively.      
### 21.Camera Condition Monitoring and Readjustment by means of Noise and Blur  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05456.pdf)
>  Autonomous vehicles and robots require increasingly more robustness and reliability to meet the demands of modern tasks. These requirements specially apply to cameras because they are the predominant sensors to acquire information about the environment and support actions. A camera must maintain proper functionality and take automatic countermeasures if necessary. However, there is little work that examines the practical use of a general condition monitoring approach for cameras and designs countermeasures in the context of an envisaged high-level application. We propose a generic and interpretable self-health-maintenance framework for cameras based on data- and physically-grounded models. To this end, we determine two reliable, real-time capable estimators for typical image effects of a camera in poor condition (defocus blur, motion blur, different noise phenomena and most common combinations) by comparing traditional and retrained machine learning-based approaches in extensive experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate how one can adjust the camera parameters (e.g., exposure time and ISO gain) to achieve optimal whole-system capability based on experimental (non-linear and non-monotonic) input-output performance curves, using object detection, motion blur and sensor noise as examples. Our framework not only provides a practical ready-to-use solution to evaluate and maintain the health of cameras, but can also serve as a basis for extensions to tackle more sophisticated problems that combine additional data sources (e.g., sensor or environment parameters) empirically in order to attain fully reliable and robust machines.      
### 22.Couplformer:Rethinking Vision Transformer with Coupling Attention Map  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05425.pdf)
>  With the development of the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer model has demonstrated its outstanding performance in the computer vision domain. However, the massive computation brought from the full attention mechanism became a heavy burden for memory consumption. Sequentially, the limitation of memory reduces the possibility of improving the Transformer model. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel memory economy attention mechanism named Couplformer, which decouples the attention map into two sub-matrices and generates the alignment scores from spatial information. A series of different scale image classification tasks are applied to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The result of experiments shows that on the ImageNet-1k classification task, the Couplformer can significantly decrease 28% memory consumption compared with regular Transformer while accessing sufficient accuracy requirements and outperforming 0.92% on Top-1 accuracy while occupying the same memory footprint. As a result, the Couplformer can serve as an efficient backbone in visual tasks, and provide a novel perspective on the attention mechanism for researchers.      
### 23.Optimizing Edge Detection for Image Segmentation with Multicut Penalties  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05416.pdf)
>  The Minimum Cost Multicut Problem (MP) is a popular way for obtaining a graph decomposition by optimizing binary edge labels over edge costs. While the formulation of a MP from independently estimated costs per edge is highly flexible and intuitive, solving the MP is NP-hard and time-expensive. As a remedy, recent work proposed to predict edge probabilities with awareness to potential conflicts by incorporating cycle constraints in the prediction process. We argue that such formulation, while providing a first step towards end-to-end learnable edge weights, is suboptimal, since it is built upon a loose relaxation of the MP. We therefore propose an adaptive CRF that allows to progressively consider more violated constraints and, in consequence, to issue solutions with higher validity. Experiments on the BSDS500 benchmark for natural image segmentation as well as on electron microscopic recordings show that our approach yields more precise edge detection and image segmentation.      
### 24.Multimedia Datasets for Anomaly Detection: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05410.pdf)
>  Multimedia anomaly datasets play a crucial role in automated surveillance. They have a wide range of applications expanding from outlier object/ situation detection to the detection of life-threatening events. This field is receiving a huge level of research interest for more than 1.5 decades, and consequently, more and more datasets dedicated to anomalous actions and object detection have been created. Tapping these public anomaly datasets enable researchers to generate and compare various anomaly detection frameworks with the same input data. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on a variety of video, audio, as well as audio-visual datasets based on the application of anomaly detection. This survey aims to address the lack of a comprehensive comparison and analysis of multimedia public datasets based on anomaly detection. Also, it can assist researchers in selecting the best available dataset for bench-marking frameworks. Additionally, we discuss gaps in the existing dataset and future direction insights towards developing multimodal anomaly detection datasets.      
### 25.The Large Labelled Logo Dataset (L3D): A Multipurpose and Hand-Labelled Continuously Growing Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05404.pdf)
>  In this work, we present the Large Labelled Logo Dataset (L3D), a multipurpose, hand-labelled, continuously growing dataset. It is composed of around 770k of color 256x256 RGB images extracted from the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) open registry. Each of them is associated to multiple labels that classify the figurative and textual elements that appear in the images. These annotations have been classified by the EUIPO evaluators using the Vienna classification, a hierarchical classification of figurative marks. We suggest two direct applications of this dataset, namely, logo classification and logo generation.      
### 26.Towards Full-to-Empty Room Generation with Structure-Aware Feature Encoding and Soft Semantic Region-Adaptive Normalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05396.pdf)
>  The task of transforming a furnished room image into a background-only is extremely challenging since it requires making large changes regarding the scene context while still preserving the overall layout and style. In order to acquire photo-realistic and structural consistent background, existing deep learning methods either employ image inpainting approaches or incorporate the learning of the scene layout as an individual task and leverage it later in a not fully differentiable semantic region-adaptive normalization module. To tackle these drawbacks, we treat scene layout generation as a feature linear transformation problem and propose a simple yet effective adjusted fully differentiable soft semantic region-adaptive normalization module (softSEAN) block. We showcase the applicability in diminished reality and depth estimation tasks, where our approach besides the advantages of mitigating training complexity and non-differentiability issues, surpasses the compared methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our softSEAN block can be used as a drop-in module for existing discriminative and generative models. Implementation is available on <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://vcl3d.github.io/PanoDR/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a>.      
### 27.UNIST: Unpaired Neural Implicit Shape Translation Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05381.pdf)
>  We introduce UNIST, the first deep neural implicit model for general-purpose, unpaired shape-to-shape translation, in both 2D and 3D domains. Our model is built on autoencoding implicit fields, rather than point clouds which represents the state of the art. Furthermore, our translation network is trained to perform the task over a latent grid representation which combines the merits of both latent-space processing and position awareness, to not only enable drastic shape transforms but also well preserve spatial features and fine local details for natural shape translations. With the same network architecture and only dictated by the input domain pairs, our model can learn both style-preserving content alteration and content-preserving style transfer. We demonstrate the generality and quality of the translation results, and compare them to well-known baselines.      
### 28.Cross-Modal Transferable Adversarial Attacks from Images to Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05379.pdf)
>  Recent studies have shown that adversarial examples hand-crafted on one white-box model can be used to attack other black-box models. Such cross-model transferability makes it feasible to perform black-box attacks, which has raised security concerns for real-world DNNs applications. Nevertheless, existing works mostly focus on investigating the adversarial transferability across different deep models that share the same modality of input data. The cross-modal transferability of adversarial perturbation has never been explored. This paper investigates the transferability of adversarial perturbation across different modalities, i.e., leveraging adversarial perturbation generated on white-box image models to attack black-box video models. Specifically, motivated by the observation that the low-level feature space between images and video frames are similar, we propose a simple yet effective cross-modal attack method, named as Image To Video (I2V) attack. I2V generates adversarial frames by minimizing the cosine similarity between features of pre-trained image models from adversarial and benign examples, then combines the generated adversarial frames to perform black-box attacks on video recognition models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that I2V can achieve high attack success rates on different black-box video recognition models. On Kinetics-400 and UCF-101, I2V achieves an average attack success rate of 77.88% and 65.68%, respectively, which sheds light on the feasibility of cross-modal adversarial attacks.      
### 29.Rethinking the Two-Stage Framework for Grounded Situation Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05375.pdf)
>  Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR), i.e., recognizing the salient activity (or verb) category in an image (e.g., buying) and detecting all corresponding semantic roles (e.g., agent and goods), is an essential step towards "human-like" event understanding. Since each verb is associated with a specific set of semantic roles, all existing GSR methods resort to a two-stage framework: predicting the verb in the first stage and detecting the semantic roles in the second stage. However, there are obvious drawbacks in both stages: 1) The widely-used cross-entropy (XE) loss for object recognition is insufficient in verb classification due to the large intra-class variation and high inter-class similarity among daily activities. 2) All semantic roles are detected in an autoregressive manner, which fails to model the complex semantic relations between different roles. To this end, we propose a novel SituFormer for GSR which consists of a Coarse-to-Fine Verb Model (CFVM) and a Transformer-based Noun Model (TNM). CFVM is a two-step verb prediction model: a coarse-grained model trained with XE loss first proposes a set of verb candidates, and then a fine-grained model trained with triplet loss re-ranks these candidates with enhanced verb features (not only separable but also discriminative). TNM is a transformer-based semantic role detection model, which detects all roles parallelly. Owing to the global relation modeling ability and flexibility of the transformer decoder, TNM can fully explore the statistical dependency of the roles. Extensive validations on the challenging SWiG benchmark show that SituFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with significant gains under various metrics.

### 30.Exploring Pixel-level Self-supervision for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05351.pdf)
>  Existing studies in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) have utilized class activation maps (CAMs) to localize the class objects. However, since a classification loss is insufficient for providing precise object regions, CAMs tend to be biased towards discriminative patterns (i.e., sparseness) and do not provide precise object boundary information (i.e., impreciseness). To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework (composed of MainNet and SupportNet.) that derives pixel-level self-supervision from given image-level supervision. In our framework, with the help of the proposed Regional Contrastive Module (RCM) and Multi-scale Attentive Module (MAM), MainNet is trained by self-supervision from the SupportNet. The RCM extracts two forms of self-supervision from SupportNet: (1) class region masks generated from the CAMs and (2) class-wise prototypes obtained from the features according to the class region masks. Then, every pixel-wise feature of the MainNet is trained by the prototype in a contrastive manner, sharpening the resulting CAMs. The MAM utilizes CAMs inferred at multiple scales from the SupportNet as self-supervision to guide the MainNet. Based on the dissimilarity between the multi-scale CAMs from MainNet and SupportNet, CAMs from the MainNet are trained to expand to the less-discriminative regions. The proposed method shows state-of-the-art WSSS performance both on the train and validation sets on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. For reproducibility, code will be available publicly soon.      
### 31.Hyperdimensional Feature Fusion for Out-Of-Distribution Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05341.pdf)
>  We introduce powerful ideas from Hyperdimensional Computing into the challenging field of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. In contrast to most existing work that performs OOD detection based on only a single layer of a neural network, we use similarity-preserving semi-orthogonal projection matrices to project the feature maps from multiple layers into a common vector space. By repeatedly applying the bundling operation $\oplus$, we create expressive class-specific descriptor vectors for all in-distribution classes. At test time, a simple and efficient cosine similarity calculation between descriptor vectors consistently identifies OOD samples with better performance than the current state-of-the-art. We show that the hyperdimensional fusion of multiple network layers is critical to achieve best general performance.      
### 32.Tradeoffs Between Contrastive and Supervised Learning: An Empirical Study  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05340.pdf)
>  Contrastive learning has made considerable progress in computer vision, outperforming supervised pretraining on a range of downstream datasets. However, is contrastive learning the better choice in all situations? We demonstrate two cases where it is not. First, under sufficiently small pretraining budgets, supervised pretraining on ImageNet consistently outperforms a comparable contrastive model on eight diverse image classification datasets. This suggests that the common practice of comparing pretraining approaches at hundreds or thousands of epochs may not produce actionable insights for those with more limited compute budgets. Second, even with larger pretraining budgets we identify tasks where supervised learning prevails, perhaps because the object-centric bias of supervised pretraining makes the model more resilient to common corruptions and spurious foreground-background correlations. These results underscore the need to characterize tradeoffs of different pretraining objectives across a wider range of contexts and training regimes.      
### 33.Uncertainty, Edge, and Reverse-Attention Guided Generative Adversarial Network for Automatic Building Detection in Remotely Sensed Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05335.pdf)
>  Despite recent advances in deep-learning based semantic segmentation, automatic building detection from remotely sensed imagery is still a challenging problem owing to large variability in the appearance of buildings across the globe. The errors occur mostly around the boundaries of the building footprints, in shadow areas, and when detecting buildings whose exterior surfaces have reflectivity properties that are very similar to those of the surrounding regions. To overcome these problems, we propose a generative adversarial network based segmentation framework with uncertainty attention unit and refinement module embedded in the generator. The refinement module, composed of edge and reverse attention units, is designed to refine the predicted building map. The edge attention enhances the boundary features to estimate building boundaries with greater precision, and the reverse attention allows the network to explore the features missing in the previously estimated regions. The uncertainty attention unit assists the network in resolving uncertainties in classification. As a measure of the power of our approach, as of December 4, 2021, it ranks at the second place on DeepGlobe's public leaderboard despite the fact that main focus of our approach -- refinement of the building edges -- does not align exactly with the metrics used for leaderboard rankings. Our overall F1-score on DeepGlobe's challenging dataset is 0.745. We also report improvements on the previous-best results for the challenging INRIA Validation Dataset for which our network achieves an overall IoU of 81.28% and an overall accuracy of 97.03%. Along the same lines, for the official INRIA Test Dataset, our network scores 77.86% and 96.41% in overall IoU and accuracy.      
### 34.FaceFormer: Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation with Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05329.pdf)
>  Speech-driven 3D facial animation is challenging due to the complex geometry of human faces and the limited availability of 3D audio-visual data. Prior works typically focus on learning phoneme-level features of short audio windows with limited context, occasionally resulting in inaccurate lip movements. To tackle this limitation, we propose a Transformer-based autoregressive model, FaceFormer, which encodes the long-term audio context and autoregressively predicts a sequence of animated 3D face meshes. To cope with the data scarcity issue, we integrate the self-supervised pre-trained speech representations. Also, we devise two biased attention mechanisms well suited to this specific task, including the biased cross-modal multi-head (MH) attention and the biased causal MH self-attention with a periodic positional encoding strategy. The former effectively aligns the audio-motion modalities, whereas the latter offers abilities to generalize to longer audio sequences. Extensive experiments and a perceptual user study show that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-arts. The code will be made available.      
### 35.Attention-based Transformation from Latent Features to Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05324.pdf)
>  In point cloud generation and completion, previous methods for transforming latent features to point clouds are generally based on fully connected layers (FC-based) or folding operations (Folding-based). However, point clouds generated by FC-based methods are usually troubled by outliers and rough surfaces. For folding-based methods, their data flow is large, convergence speed is slow, and they are also hard to handle the generation of non-smooth surfaces. In this work, we propose AXform, an attention-based method to transform latent features to point clouds. AXform first generates points in an interim space, using a fully connected layer. These interim points are then aggregated to generate the target point cloud. AXform takes both parameter sharing and data flow into account, which makes it has fewer outliers, fewer network parameters, and a faster convergence speed. The points generated by AXform do not have the strong 2-manifold constraint, which improves the generation of non-smooth surfaces. When AXform is expanded to multiple branches for local generations, the centripetal constraint makes it has properties of self-clustering and space consistency, which further enables unsupervised semantic segmentation. We also adopt this scheme and design AXformNet for point cloud completion. Considerable experiments on different datasets show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art results.      
### 36.Self-Ensemling for 3D Point Cloud Domain Adaption  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05301.pdf)
>  Recently 3D point cloud learning has been a hot topic in computer vision and autonomous driving. Due to the fact that it is difficult to manually annotate a qualitative large-scale 3D point cloud dataset, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is popular in 3D point cloud learning which aims to transfer the learned knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. However, the generalization and reconstruction errors caused by domain shift with simply-learned model are inevitable which substantially hinder the model's capability from learning good representations. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end self-ensembling network (SEN) for 3D point cloud domain adaption tasks. Generally, our SEN resorts to the advantages of Mean Teacher and semi-supervised learning, and introduces a soft classification loss and a consistency loss, aiming to achieve consistent generalization and accurate reconstruction. In SEN, a student network is kept in a collaborative manner with supervised learning and self-supervised learning, and a teacher network conducts temporal consistency to learn useful representations and ensure the quality of point clouds reconstruction. Extensive experiments on several 3D point cloud UDA benchmarks show that our SEN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both classification and segmentation tasks. Moreover, further analysis demonstrates that our SEN also achieves better reconstruction results.      
### 37.Representing 3D Shapes with Probabilistic Directed Distance Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05300.pdf)
>  Differentiable rendering is an essential operation in modern vision, allowing inverse graphics approaches to 3D understanding to be utilized in modern machine learning frameworks. Explicit shape representations (voxels, point clouds, or meshes), while relatively easily rendered, often suffer from limited geometric fidelity or topological constraints. On the other hand, implicit representations (occupancy, distance, or radiance fields) preserve greater fidelity, but suffer from complex or inefficient rendering processes, limiting scalability. In this work, we endeavour to address both shortcomings with a novel shape representation that allows fast differentiable rendering within an implicit architecture. Building on implicit distance representations, we define Directed Distance Fields (DDFs), which map an oriented point (position and direction) to surface visibility and depth. Such a field can render a depth map with a single forward pass per pixel, enable differential surface geometry extraction (e.g., surface normals and curvatures) via network derivatives, be easily composed, and permit extraction of classical unsigned distance fields. Using probabilistic DDFs (PDDFs), we show how to model inherent discontinuities in the underlying field. Finally, we apply our method to fitting single shapes, unpaired 3D-aware generative image modelling, and single-image 3D reconstruction tasks, showcasing strong performance with simple architectural components via the versatility of our representation.      
### 38.IFR-Explore: Learning Inter-object Functional Relationships in 3D Indoor Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05298.pdf)
>  Building embodied intelligent agents that can interact with 3D indoor environments has received increasing research attention in recent years. While most works focus on single-object or agent-object visual functionality and affordances, our work proposes to study a new kind of visual relationship that is also important to perceive and model -- inter-object functional relationships (e.g., a switch on the wall turns on or off the light, a remote control operates the TV). Humans often spend little or no effort to infer these relationships, even when entering a new room, by using our strong prior knowledge (e.g., we know that buttons control electrical devices) or using only a few exploratory interactions in cases of uncertainty (e.g., multiple switches and lights in the same room). In this paper, we take the first step in building AI system learning inter-object functional relationships in 3D indoor environments with key technical contributions of modeling prior knowledge by training over large-scale scenes and designing interactive policies for effectively exploring the training scenes and quickly adapting to novel test scenes. We create a new benchmark based on the AI2Thor and PartNet datasets and perform extensive experiments that prove the effectiveness of our proposed method. Results show that our model successfully learns priors and fast-interactive-adaptation strategies for exploring inter-object functional relationships in complex 3D scenes. Several ablation studies further validate the usefulness of each proposed module.      
### 39.3D Scene Understanding at Urban Intersection using Stereo Vision and Digital Map  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05295.pdf)
>  The driving behavior at urban intersections is very complex. It is thus crucial for autonomous vehicles to comprehensively understand challenging urban traffic scenes in order to navigate intersections and prevent accidents. In this paper, we introduce a stereo vision and 3D digital map based approach to spatially and temporally analyze the traffic situation at urban intersections. Stereo vision is used to detect, classify and track obstacles, while a 3D digital map is used to improve ego-localization and provide context in terms of road-layout information. A probabilistic approach that temporally integrates these geometric, semantic, dynamic and contextual cues is presented. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our proposed technique on real traffic data collected at an urban canyon in Tokyo to demonstrate the efficacy of the system in providing comprehensive awareness of the traffic surroundings.      
### 40.LCTR: On Awakening the Local Continuity of Transformer for Weakly Supervised Object Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05291.pdf)
>  Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to learn object localizer solely by using image-level labels. The convolution neural network (CNN) based techniques often result in highlighting the most discriminative part of objects while ignoring the entire object extent. Recently, the transformer architecture has been deployed to WSOL to capture the long-range feature dependencies with self-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron structure. Nevertheless, transformers lack the locality inductive bias inherent to CNNs and therefore may deteriorate local feature details in WSOL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework built upon the transformer, termed LCTR (Local Continuity TRansformer), which targets at enhancing the local perception capability of global features among long-range feature dependencies. To this end, we propose a relational patch-attention module (RPAM), which considers cross-patch information on a global basis. We further design a cue digging module (CDM), which utilizes local features to guide the learning trend of the model for highlighting the weak local responses. Finally, comprehensive experiments are carried out on two widely used datasets, ie, CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC, to verify the effectiveness of our method.      
### 41.Image-to-Image Translation-based Data Augmentation for Robust EV Charging Inlet Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05290.pdf)
>  This work addresses the task of electric vehicle (EV) charging inlet detection for autonomous EV charging robots. Recently, automated EV charging systems have received huge attention to improve users' experience and to efficiently utilize charging infrastructures and parking lots. However, most related works have focused on system design, robot control, planning, and manipulation. Towards robust EV charging inlet detection, we propose a new dataset (EVCI dataset) and a novel data augmentation method that is based on image-to-image translation where typical image-to-image translation methods synthesize a new image in a different domain given an image. To the best of our knowledge, the EVCI dataset is the first EV charging inlet dataset. For the data augmentation method, we focus on being able to control synthesized images' captured environments (e.g., time, lighting) in an intuitive way. To achieve this, we first propose the environment guide vector that humans can intuitively interpret. We then propose a novel image-to-image translation network that translates a given image towards the environment described by the vector. Accordingly, it aims to synthesize a new image that has the same content as the given image while looking like captured in the provided environment by the environment guide vector. Lastly, we train a detection method using the augmented dataset. Through experiments on the EVCI dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We also show that the proposed method is able to control synthesized images using an image and environment guide vectors.      
### 42.Long-Range Thermal 3D Perception in Low Contrast Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05280.pdf)
>  This report discusses the results of SBIR Phase I effort to prove the feasibility of dramatic improvement of the microbolometer-based Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) detectors sensitivity, especially for the 3D measurements. The resulting low SWaP-C thermal depth-sensing system will enable the situational awareness of Autonomous Air Vehicles for Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). It will provide robust 3D information of the surrounding environment, including low-contrast static and moving objects, at far distances in degraded visual conditions and GPS-denied areas. Our multi-sensor 3D perception enabled by COTS uncooled thermal sensors mitigates major weakness of LWIR sensors - low contrast by increasing the system sensitivity over an order of magnitude. <br>There were no available thermal image sets suitable for evaluating this technology, making datasets acquisition our first goal. We discuss the design and construction of the prototype system with sixteen 640pix x 512pix LWIR detectors, camera calibration to subpixel resolution, capture, and process synchronized image. The results show the 3.84x contrast increase for intrascene-only data and an additional 5.5x - with the interscene accumulation, reaching system noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 1.9 mK with the 40 mK sensors.      
### 43.Skeletal Graph Self-Attention: Embedding a Skeleton Inductive Bias into Sign Language Production  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05277.pdf)
>  Recent approaches to Sign Language Production (SLP) have adopted spoken language Neural Machine Translation (NMT) architectures, applied without sign-specific modifications. In addition, these works represent sign language as a sequence of skeleton pose vectors, projected to an abstract representation with no inherent skeletal structure. In this paper, we represent sign language sequences as a skeletal graph structure, with joints as nodes and both spatial and temporal connections as edges. To operate on this graphical structure, we propose Skeletal Graph Self-Attention (SGSA), a novel graphical attention layer that embeds a skeleton inductive bias into the SLP model. Retaining the skeletal feature representation throughout, we directly apply a spatio-temporal adjacency matrix into the self-attention formulation. This provides structure and context to each skeletal joint that is not possible when using a non-graphical abstract representation, enabling fluid and expressive sign language production. We evaluate our Skeletal Graph Self-Attention architecture on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T(PHOENIX14T) dataset, achieving state-of-the-art back translation performance with an 8% and 7% improvement over competing methods for the dev and test sets.      
### 44.The Many Faces of Anger: A Multicultural Video Dataset of Negative Emotions in the Wild (MFA-Wild)  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05267.pdf)
>  The portrayal of negative emotions such as anger can vary widely between cultures and contexts, depending on the acceptability of expressing full-blown emotions rather than suppression to maintain harmony. The majority of emotional datasets collect data under the broad label ``anger", but social signals can range from annoyed, contemptuous, angry, furious, hateful, and more. In this work, we curated the first in-the-wild multicultural video dataset of emotions, and deeply explored anger-related emotional expressions by asking culture-fluent annotators to label the videos with 6 labels and 13 emojis in a multi-label framework. We provide a baseline multi-label classifier on our dataset, and show how emojis can be effectively used as a language-agnostic tool for annotation.      
### 45.MAGMA -- Multimodal Augmentation of Generative Models through Adapter-based Finetuning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05253.pdf)
>  Large-scale pretraining is fast becoming the norm in Vision-Language (VL) modeling. However, prevailing VL approaches are limited by the requirement for labeled data and the use of complex multi-step pretraining objectives. We present MAGMA - a simple method for augmenting generative language models with additional modalities using adapter-based finetuning. Building on Frozen, we train a series of VL models that autoregressively generate text from arbitrary combinations of visual and textual input. The pretraining is entirely end-to-end using a single language modeling objective, simplifying optimization compared to previous approaches. Importantly, the language model weights remain unchanged during training, allowing for transfer of encyclopedic knowledge and in-context learning abilities from language pretraining. MAGMA outperforms Frozen on open-ended generative tasks, achieving state of the art results on the OKVQA benchmark and competitive results on a range of other popular VL benchmarks, while pretraining on 0.2% of the number of samples used to train SimVLM.      
### 46.Transfer learning using deep neural networks for Ear Presentation Attack Detection: New Database for PAD  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05237.pdf)
>  Ear recognition system has been widely studied whereas there are just a few ear presentation attack detection methods for ear recognition systems, consequently, there is no publicly available ear presentation attack detection (PAD) database. In this paper, we propose a PAD method using a pre-trained deep neural network and release a new dataset called Warsaw University of Technology Ear Dataset for Presentation Attack Detection (WUT-Ear V1.0). There is no ear database that is captured using mobile devices. Hence, we have captured more than 8500 genuine ear images from 134 subjects and more than 8500 fake ear images using. We made replay-attack and photo print attacks with 3 different mobile devices. Our approach achieves 99.83% and 0.08% for the half total error rate (HTER) and attack presentation classification error rate (APCER), respectively, on the replay-attack database. The captured data is analyzed and visualized statistically to find out its importance and make it a benchmark for further research. The experiments have been found out a secure PAD method for ear recognition system, publicly available ear image, and ear PAD dataset.

### 47.KartalOl: Transfer learning using deep neural network for iris segmentation and localization: New dataset for iris segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05236.pdf)
>  Iris segmentation and localization in unconstrained environments is challenging due to long distances, illumination variations, limited user cooperation, and moving subjects. To address this problem, we present a U-Net with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 deep neural network method. We employ the pre-trained weights given with MobileNetV2 for the ImageNet dataset and fine-tune it on the iris recognition and localization domain. Further, we have introduced a new dataset, called KartalOl, to better evaluate detectors in iris recognition scenarios. To provide domain adaptation, we fine-tune the MobileNetV2 model on the provided data for NIR-ISL 2021 from the CASIA-Iris-Asia, CASIA-Iris-M1, and CASIA-Iris-Africa and our dataset. We also augment the data by performing left-right flips, rotation, zoom, and brightness. We chose the binarization threshold for the binary masks by iterating over the images in the provided dataset. The proposed method is tested and trained in CASIA-Iris-Asia, CASIA-Iris-M1, CASIA-Iris-Africa, along the KartalOl dataset. The experimental results highlight that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods on mobile-based benchmarks. The codes and evaluation results are publicly available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Jalilnkh/KartalOl-NIR-ISL2021031301" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 48.Injecting Semantic Concepts into End-to-End Image Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05230.pdf)
>  Tremendous progress has been made in recent years in developing better image captioning models, yet most of them rely on a separate object detector to extract regional features. Recent vision-language studies are shifting towards the detector-free trend by leveraging grid representations for more flexible model training and faster inference speed. However, such development is primarily focused on image understanding tasks, and remains less investigated for the caption generation task. In this paper, we are concerned with a better-performing detector-free image captioning model, and propose a pure vision transformer-based image captioning model, dubbed as ViTCAP, in which grid representations are used without extracting the regional features. For improved performance, we introduce a novel Concept Token Network (CTN) to predict the semantic concepts and then incorporate them into the end-to-end captioning. In particular, the CTN is built on the basis of a vision transformer and is designed to predict the concept tokens through a classification task, from which the rich semantic information contained greatly benefits the captioning task. Compared with the previous detector-based models, ViTCAP drastically simplifies the architectures and at the same time achieves competitive performance on various challenging image captioning datasets. In particular, ViTCAP reaches 138.1 CIDEr scores on COCO-caption Karpathy-split, 93.8 and 108.6 CIDEr scores on nocaps, and Google-CC captioning datasets, respectively.      
### 49.CLIP2StyleGAN: Unsupervised Extraction of StyleGAN Edit Directions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05219.pdf)
>  The success of StyleGAN has enabled unprecedented semantic editing capabilities, on both synthesized and real images. However, such editing operations are either trained with semantic supervision or described using human guidance. In another development, the CLIP architecture has been trained with internet-scale image and text pairings and has been shown to be useful in several zero-shot learning settings. In this work, we investigate how to effectively link the pretrained latent spaces of StyleGAN and CLIP, which in turn allows us to automatically extract semantically labeled edit directions from StyleGAN, finding and naming meaningful edit operations without any additional human guidance. Technically, we propose two novel building blocks; one for finding interesting CLIP directions and one for labeling arbitrary directions in CLIP latent space. The setup does not assume any pre-determined labels and hence we do not require any additional supervised text/attributes to build the editing framework. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate that extraction of disentangled labeled StyleGAN edit directions is indeed possible, and reveals interesting and non-trivial edit directions.      
### 50.Road Extraction from Overhead Images with Graph Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05215.pdf)
>  Automatic road graph extraction from aerial and satellite images is a long-standing challenge. Existing algorithms are either based on pixel-level segmentation followed by vectorization, or on iterative graph construction using next move prediction. Both of these strategies suffer from severe drawbacks, in particular high computing resources and incomplete outputs. By contrast, we propose a method that directly infers the final road graph in a single pass. The key idea consists in combining a Fully Convolutional Network in charge of locating points of interest such as intersections, dead ends and turns, and a Graph Neural Network which predicts links between these points. Such a strategy is more efficient than iterative methods and allows us to streamline the training process by removing the need for generation of starting locations while keeping the training end-to-end. We evaluate our method against existing works on the popular RoadTracer dataset and achieve competitive results. We also benchmark the speed of our method and show that it outperforms existing approaches. This opens the possibility of in-flight processing on embedded devices.      
### 51.Progressive Seed Generation Auto-encoder for Unsupervised Point Cloud Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05213.pdf)
>  With the development of 3D scanning technologies, 3D vision tasks have become a popular research area. Owing to the large amount of data acquired by sensors, unsupervised learning is essential for understanding and utilizing point clouds without an expensive annotation process. In this paper, we propose a novel framework and an effective auto-encoder architecture named "PSG-Net" for reconstruction-based learning of point clouds. Unlike existing studies that used fixed or random 2D points, our framework generates input-dependent point-wise features for the latent point set. PSG-Net uses the encoded input to produce point-wise features through the seed generation module and extracts richer features in multiple stages with gradually increasing resolution by applying the seed feature propagation module progressively. We prove the effectiveness of PSG-Net experimentally; PSG-Net shows state-of-the-art performances in point cloud reconstruction and unsupervised classification, and achieves comparable performance to counterpart methods in supervised completion.      
### 52.7th AI Driving Olympics: 1st Place Report for Panoptic Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05210.pdf)
>  In this technical report, we describe our EfficientLPT architecture that won the panoptic tracking challenge in the 7th AI Driving Olympics at NeurIPS 2021. Our architecture builds upon the top-down EfficientLPS panoptic segmentation approach. EfficientLPT consists of a shared backbone with a modified EfficientNet-B5 model comprising the proximity convolution module as the encoder followed by the range-aware FPN to aggregate semantically rich range-aware multi-scale features. Subsequently, we employ two task-specific heads, the scale-invariant semantic head and hybrid task cascade with feedback from the semantic head as the instance head. Further, we employ a novel panoptic fusion module to adaptively fuse logits from each of the heads to yield the panoptic tracking output. Our approach exploits three consecutive accumulated scans to predict locally consistent panoptic tracking IDs and also the overlap between the scans to predict globally consistent panoptic tracking IDs for a given sequence. The benchmarking results from the 7th AI Driving Olympics at NeurIPS 2021 show that our model is ranked #1 for the panoptic tracking task on the Panoptic nuScenes dataset.      
### 53.Contextualized Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning with Self-Supervision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05181.pdf)
>  A modern self-supervised learning algorithm typically enforces persistency of the representations of an instance across views. While being very effective on learning holistic image and video representations, such an approach becomes sub-optimal for learning spatio-temporally fine-grained features in videos, where scenes and instances evolve through space and time. In this paper, we present the Contextualized Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning (ConST-CL) framework to effectively learn spatio-temporally fine-grained representations using self-supervision. We first design a region-based self-supervised pretext task which requires the model to learn to transform instance representations from one view to another guided by context features. Further, we introduce a simple network design that effectively reconciles the simultaneous learning process of both holistic and local representations. We evaluate our learned representations on a variety of downstream tasks and ConST-CL achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets. For spatio-temporal action localization, ConST-CL achieves 39.4% mAP with ground-truth boxes and 30.5% mAP with detected boxes on the AVA-Kinetics validation set. For object tracking, ConST-CL achieves 78.1% precision and 55.2% success scores on OTB2015. Furthermore, ConST-CL achieves 94.8% and 71.9% top-1 fine-tuning accuracy on video action recognition datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51 respectively. We plan to release our code and models to the public.      
### 54.Edge-aware Guidance Fusion Network for RGB Thermal Scene Parsing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05144.pdf)
>  RGB thermal scene parsing has recently attracted increasing research interest in the field of computer vision. However, most existing methods fail to perform good boundary extraction for prediction maps and cannot fully use high level features. In addition, these methods simply fuse the features from RGB and thermal modalities but are unable to obtain comprehensive fused features. To address these problems, we propose an edge-aware guidance fusion network (EGFNet) for RGB thermal scene parsing. First, we introduce a prior edge map generated using the RGB and thermal images to capture detailed information in the prediction map and then embed the prior edge information in the feature maps. To effectively fuse the RGB and thermal information, we propose a multimodal fusion module that guarantees adequate cross-modal fusion. Considering the importance of high level semantic information, we propose a global information module and a semantic information module to extract rich semantic information from the high-level features. For decoding, we use simple elementwise addition for cascaded feature fusion. Finally, to improve the parsing accuracy, we apply multitask deep supervision to the semantic and boundary maps. Extensive experiments were performed on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EGFNet and its superior performance compared with state of the art methods.

### 55.Deep Learning based Framework for Automatic Diagnosis of Glaucoma based on analysis of Focal Notching in the Optic Nerve Head  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05748.pdf)
>  Automatic evaluation of the retinal fundus image is emerging as one of the most important tools for early detection and treatment of progressive eye diseases like Glaucoma. Glaucoma results to a progressive degeneration of vision and is characterized by the deformation of the shape of optic cup and the degeneration of the blood vessels resulting in the formation of a notch along the neuroretinal rim. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based pipeline for automatic segmentation of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) regions from Digital Fundus Images (DFIs), thereby extracting distinct features necessary for prediction of Glaucoma. This methodology has utilized focal notch analysis of neuroretinal rim along with cup-to-disc ratio values as classifying parameters to enhance the accuracy of Computer-aided design (CAD) systems in analyzing glaucoma. Support Vector-based Machine Learning algorithm is used for classification, which classifies DFIs as Glaucomatous or Normal based on the extracted features. The proposed pipeline was evaluated on the freely available DRISHTI-GS dataset with a resultant accuracy of 93.33% for detecting Glaucoma from DFIs.

### 57.Preemptive Image Robustification for Protecting Users against Man-in-the-Middle Adversarial Attacks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05634.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have become the driving force of modern image recognition systems. However, the vulnerability of neural networks against adversarial attacks poses a serious threat to the people affected by these systems. In this paper, we focus on a real-world threat model where a Man-in-the-Middle adversary maliciously intercepts and perturbs images web users upload online. This type of attack can raise severe ethical concerns on top of simple performance degradation. To prevent this attack, we devise a novel bi-level optimization algorithm that finds points in the vicinity of natural images that are robust to adversarial perturbations. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show our method can effectively robustify natural images within the given modification budget. We also show the proposed method can improve robustness when jointly used with randomized smoothing.      
### 58.An Embarrassingly Pragmatic Introduction to Vision-based Autonomous Robots  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05534.pdf)
>  Autonomous robots are currently one of the most popular Artificial Intelligence problems, having experienced significant advances in the last decade, from Self-driving cars and humanoids to delivery robots and drones. Part of the problem is to get a robot to emulate the perception of human beings, our sense of sight, replacing the eyes with cameras and the brain with mathematical models such as Neural Networks. Developing an AI able to drive a car without human intervention and a small robot to deliver packages in the city may seem like different problems, nevertheless from the point of view of perception and vision, both problems have several similarities. The main solutions we currently find focus on the environment perception through visual information using Computer Vision techniques, Machine Learning, and various algorithms to make the robot understand the environment or scene, move, adapt its trajectory and perform its tasks (maintenance, exploration, etc.) without the need for human intervention. In this work, we develop a small-scale autonomous vehicle from scratch, capable of understanding the scene using only visual information, navigating through industrial environments, detecting people and obstacles, or performing simple maintenance tasks. We review the state-of-the-art of fundamental problems and demonstrate that many methods employed at small-scale are similar to the ones employed in real Self-driving cars from companies like Tesla or Lyft. Finally, we discuss the current state of Robotics and autonomous driving and the technological and ethical limitations that we can find in this field.      
### 59.DeepRLS: A Recurrent Network Architecture with Least Squares Implicit Layers for Non-blind Image Deconvolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05505.pdf)
>  In this work, we study the problem of non-blind image deconvolution and propose a novel recurrent network architecture that leads to very competitive restoration results of high image quality. Motivated by the computational efficiency and robustness of existing large scale linear solvers, we manage to express the solution to this problem as the solution of a series of adaptive non-negative least-squares problems. This gives rise to our proposed Recurrent Least Squares Deconvolution Network (RLSDN) architecture, which consists of an implicit layer that imposes a linear constraint between its input and output. By design, our network manages to serve two important purposes simultaneously. The first is that it implicitly models an effective image prior that can adequately characterize the set of natural images, while the second is that it recovers the corresponding maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. Experiments on publicly available datasets, comparing recent state-of-the-art methods, show that our proposed RLSDN approach achieves the best reported performance both for grayscale and color images for all tested scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training strategy that can be adopted by any network architecture that involves the solution of linear systems as part of its pipeline. Our strategy eliminates completely the need to unroll the iterations required by the linear solver and, thus, it reduces significantly the memory footprint during training. Consequently, this enables the training of deeper network architectures which can further improve the reconstruction results.      
### 60.Network Compression via Central Filter  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05493.pdf)
>  Neural network pruning has remarkable performance for reducing the complexity of deep network models. Recent network pruning methods usually focused on removing unimportant or redundant filters in the network. In this paper, by exploring the similarities between feature maps, we propose a novel filter pruning method, Central Filter (CF), which suggests that a filter is approximately equal to a set of other filters after appropriate adjustments. Our method is based on the discovery that the average similarity between feature maps changes very little, regardless of the number of input images. Based on this finding, we establish similarity graphs on feature maps and calculate the closeness centrality of each node to select the Central Filter. Moreover, we design a method to directly adjust weights in the next layer corresponding to the Central Filter, effectively minimizing the error caused by pruning. Through experiments on various benchmark networks and datasets, CF yields state-of-the-art performance. For example, with ResNet-56, CF reduces approximately 39.7% of FLOPs by removing 47.1% of the parameters, with even 0.33% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10. With GoogLeNet, CF reduces approximately 63.2% of FLOPs by removing 55.6% of the parameters, with only a small loss of 0.35% in top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10. With ResNet-50, CF reduces approximately 47.9% of FLOPs by removing 36.9% of the parameters, with only a small loss of 1.07% in top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

### 61.Critical configurations for three projective views  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05478.pdf)
>  The problem of structure from motion is concerned with recovering the 3-dimensional structure of an object from a set of 2-dimensional images. Generally, all information can be uniquely recovered if enough images and image points are provided, yet there are certain cases where unique recovery is impossible; these are called critical configurations. In this paper we use an algebraic approach to study the critical configurations for three projective cameras. We show that all critical configurations lie on the intersection of quadric surfaces, and classify exactly which intersections constitute a critical configuration.      
### 62.Predicting Physical World Destinations for Commands Given to Self-Driving Cars  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05419.pdf)
>  In recent years, we have seen significant steps taken in the development of self-driving cars. Multiple companies are starting to roll out impressive systems that work in a variety of settings. These systems can sometimes give the impression that full self-driving is just around the corner and that we would soon build cars without even a steering wheel. The increase in the level of autonomy and control given to an AI provides an opportunity for new modes of human-vehicle interaction. However, surveys have shown that giving more control to an AI in self-driving cars is accompanied by a degree of uneasiness by passengers. In an attempt to alleviate this issue, recent works have taken a natural language-oriented approach by allowing the passenger to give commands that refer to specific objects in the visual scene. Nevertheless, this is only half the task as the car should also understand the physical destination of the command, which is what we focus on in this paper. We propose an extension in which we annotate the 3D destination that the car needs to reach after executing the given command and evaluate multiple different baselines on predicting this destination location. Additionally, we introduce a model that outperforms the prior works adapted for this particular setting.      
### 63.Dynamic hardware system for cascade SVM classification of melanoma  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05322.pdf)
>  Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, which is responsible for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths. Early diagnosis of melanoma can significantly reduce mortality rates and treatment costs. Therefore, skin cancer specialists are using image-based diagnostic tools for detecting melanoma earlier. We aim to develop a handheld device featured with low cost and high performance to enhance early detection of melanoma at the primary healthcare. But, developing this device is very challenging due to the complicated computations required by the embedded diagnosis system. Thus, we aim to exploit the recent hardware technology in reconfigurable computing to achieve a high-performance embedded system at low cost. Support vector machine (SVM) is a common classifier that shows high accuracy for classifying melanoma within the diagnosis system and is considered as the most compute-intensive task in the system. In this paper, we propose a dynamic hardware system for implementing a cascade SVM classifier on FPGA for early melanoma detection. A multi-core architecture is proposed to implement a two-stage cascade classifier using two classifiers with accuracies of 98% and 73%. The hardware implementation results were optimized by using the dynamic partial reconfiguration technology, where very low resource utilization of 1% slices and power consumption of 1.5 W were achieved. Consequently, the implemented dynamic hardware system meets vital embedded system constraints of high performance and low cost, resource utilization, and power consumption, while achieving efficient classification with high accuracy.      
### 64.Surrogate-based cross-correlation for particle image velocimetry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05303.pdf)
>  This paper presents a novel surrogate-based cross-correlation (SBCC) framework to improve the correlation performance between two image signals. The basic idea behind the SBCC is that an optimized surrogate filter/image, supplanting one original image, will produce a more robust and more accurate correlation signal. The cross-correlation estimation of the SBCC is formularized with an objective function composed of surrogate loss and correlation consistency loss. The closed-form solution provides an efficient estimation. To our surprise, the SBCC framework could provide an alternative view to explain a set of generalized cross-correlation (GCC) methods and comprehend the meaning of parameters. With the help of our SBCC framework, we further propose four new specific cross-correlation methods, and provide some suggestions for improving existing GCC methods. A noticeable fact is that the SBCC could enhance the correlation robustness by incorporating other negative context images. Considering the sub-pixel accuracy and robustness requirement of particle image velocimetry (PIV), the contribution of each term in the objective function is investigated with particles' images. Compared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods, the SBCC methods exhibit improved performance (accuracy and robustness) on the synthetic dataset and several challenging real experimental PIV cases.      
### 65.RamBoAttack: A Robust Query Efficient Deep Neural Network Decision Exploit  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05282.pdf)
>  Machine learning models are critically susceptible to evasion attacks from adversarial examples. Generally, adversarial examples, modified inputs deceptively similar to the original input, are constructed under whitebox settings by adversaries with full access to the model. However, recent attacks have shown a remarkable reduction in query numbers to craft adversarial examples using blackbox attacks. Particularly, alarming is the ability to exploit the classification decision from the access interface of a trained model provided by a growing number of Machine Learning as a Service providers including Google, Microsoft, IBM and used by a plethora of applications incorporating these models. The ability of an adversary to exploit only the predicted label from a model to craft adversarial examples is distinguished as a decision-based attack. In our study, we first deep dive into recent state-of-the-art decision-based attacks in ICLR and SP to highlight the costly nature of discovering low distortion adversarial employing gradient estimation methods. We develop a robust query efficient attack capable of avoiding entrapment in a local minimum and misdirection from noisy gradients seen in gradient estimation methods. The attack method we propose, RamBoAttack, exploits the notion of Randomized Block Coordinate Descent to explore the hidden classifier manifold, targeting perturbations to manipulate only localized input features to address the issues of gradient estimation methods. Importantly, the RamBoAttack is more robust to the different sample inputs available to an adversary and the targeted class. Overall, for a given target class, RamBoAttack is demonstrated to be more robust at achieving a lower distortion within a given query budget. We curate our extensive results using the large-scale high-resolution ImageNet dataset and open-source our attack, test samples and artifacts on GitHub.      
### 66.MantissaCam: Learning Snapshot High-dynamic-range Imaging with Perceptually-based In-pixel Irradiance Encoding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05221.pdf)
>  The ability to image high-dynamic-range (HDR) scenes is crucial in many computer vision applications. The dynamic range of conventional sensors, however, is fundamentally limited by their well capacity, resulting in saturation of bright scene parts. To overcome this limitation, emerging sensors offer in-pixel processing capabilities to encode the incident irradiance. Among the most promising encoding schemes is modulo wrapping, which results in a computational photography problem where the HDR scene is computed by an irradiance unwrapping algorithm from the wrapped low-dynamic-range (LDR) sensor image. Here, we design a neural network--based algorithm that outperforms previous irradiance unwrapping methods and, more importantly, we design a perceptually inspired "mantissa" encoding scheme that more efficiently wraps an HDR scene into an LDR sensor. Combined with our reconstruction framework, MantissaCam achieves state-of-the-art results among modulo-type snapshot HDR imaging approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in simulation and show preliminary results of a prototype MantissaCam implemented with a programmable sensor.      
### 67.Hidden Path Selection Network for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05220.pdf)
>  Targeting at depicting land covers with pixel-wise semantic categories, semantic segmentation in remote sensing images needs to portray diverse distributions over vast geographical locations, which is difficult to be achieved by the homogeneous pixel-wise forward paths in the architectures of existing deep models. Although several algorithms have been designed to select pixel-wise adaptive forward paths for natural image analysis, it still lacks theoretical supports on how to obtain optimal selections. In this paper, we provide mathematical analyses in terms of the parameter optimization, which guides us to design a method called Hidden Path Selection Network (HPS-Net). With the help of hidden variables derived from an extra mini-branch, HPS-Net is able to tackle the inherent problem about inaccessible global optimums by adjusting the direct relationships between feature maps and pixel-wise path selections in existing algorithms, which we call hidden path selection. For the better training and evaluation, we further refine and expand the 5-class Gaofen Image Dataset (GID-5) to a new one with 15 land-cover categories, i.e., GID-15. The experimental results on both GID-5 and GID-15 demonstrate that the proposed modules can stably improve the performance of different deep structures, which validates the proposed mathematical analyses.      
### 68.Report-Guided Automatic Lesion Annotation for Deep Learning-Based Prostate Cancer Detection in bpMRI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05151.pdf)
>  Deep learning-based diagnostic performance increases with more annotated data, but manual annotation is a bottleneck in most fields. Experts evaluate diagnostic images during clinical routine, and write their findings in reports. Automatic annotation based on clinical reports could overcome the manual labelling bottleneck. We hypothesise that dense annotations for detection tasks can be generated using model predictions, guided by sparse information from these reports. To demonstrate efficacy, we generated clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) annotations, guided by the number of clinically significant findings in the radiology reports. We included 7,756 prostate MRI examinations, of which 3,050 were manually annotated and 4,706 were automatically annotated. We evaluated the automatic annotation quality on the manually annotated subset: our score extraction correctly identified the number of csPCa lesions for $99.3\%$ of the reports and our csPCa segmentation model correctly localised $83.8 \pm 1.1\%$ of the lesions. We evaluated prostate cancer detection performance on 300 exams from an external centre with histopathology-confirmed ground truth. Augmenting the training set with automatically labelled exams improved patient-based diagnostic area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from $88.1\pm 1.1\%$ to $89.8\pm 1.0\%$ ($P = 1.2 \cdot 10^{-4}$) and improved lesion-based sensitivity at one false positive per case from $79.2 \pm 2.8\%$ to $85.4 \pm 1.9\%$ ($P&lt;10^{-4}$), with $mean \pm std.$ over 15 independent runs. This improved performance demonstrates the feasibility of our report-guided automatic annotations.

### 69.Deep Recurrent Neural Network with Multi-scale Bi-directional Propagation for Video Deblurring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05150.pdf)
>  The success of the state-of-the-art video deblurring methods stems mainly from implicit or explicit estimation of alignment among the adjacent frames for latent video restoration. However, due to the influence of the blur effect, estimating the alignment information from the blurry adjacent frames is not a trivial task. Inaccurate estimations will interfere the following frame restoration. Instead of estimating alignment information, we propose a simple and effective deep Recurrent Neural Network with Multi-scale Bi-directional Propagation (RNN-MBP) to effectively propagate and gather the information from unaligned neighboring frames for better video deblurring. Specifically, we build a Multi-scale Bi-directional Propagation~(MBP) module with two U-Net RNN cells which can directly exploit the inter-frame information from unaligned neighboring hidden states by integrating them in different scales. Moreover, to better evaluate the proposed algorithm and existing state-of-the-art methods on real-world blurry scenes, we also create a Real-World Blurry Video Dataset (RBVD) by a well-designed Digital Video Acquisition System (DVAS) and use it as the training and evaluation dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RBVD dataset effectively improves the performance of existing algorithms on real-world blurry videos, and the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on three typical benchmarks.

### 70.DiffuseMorph: Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration Along Continuous Trajectory Using Diffusion Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05149.pdf)
>  Deformable image registration is one of the fundamental tasks for medical imaging and computer vision. Classical registration algorithms usually rely on iterative optimization approaches to provide accurate deformation, which requires high computational cost. Although many deep-learning-based methods have been developed to carry out fast image registration, it is still challenging to estimate the deformation field with less topological folding problem. Furthermore, these approaches only enable registration to a single fixed image, and it is not possible to obtain continuously varying registration results between the moving and fixed images. To address this, here we present a novel approach of diffusion model-based probabilistic image registration, called DiffuseMorph. Specifically, our model learns the score function of the deformation between moving and fixed images. Similar to the existing diffusion models, DiffuseMorph not only provides synthetic deformed images through a reverse diffusion process, but also enables various levels of deformation of the moving image along with the latent space. Experimental results on 2D face expression image and 3D brain image registration tasks demonstrate that our method can provide flexible and accurate deformation with a capability of topology preservation.      
### 71.Learning Deep Context-Sensitive Decomposition for Low-Light Image Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05147.pdf)
>  Enhancing the quality of low-light images plays a very important role in many image processing and multimedia applications. In recent years, a variety of deep learning techniques have been developed to address this challenging task. A typical framework is to simultaneously estimate the illumination and reflectance, but they disregard the scene-level contextual information encapsulated in feature spaces, causing many unfavorable outcomes, e.g., details loss, color unsaturation, artifacts, and so on. To address these issues, we develop a new context-sensitive decomposition network architecture to exploit the scene-level contextual dependencies on spatial scales. More concretely, we build a two-stream estimation mechanism including reflectance and illumination estimation network. We design a novel context-sensitive decomposition connection to bridge the two-stream mechanism by incorporating the physical principle. The spatially-varying illumination guidance is further constructed for achieving the edge-aware smoothness property of the illumination component. According to different training patterns, we construct CSDNet (paired supervision) and CSDGAN (unpaired supervision) to fully evaluate our designed architecture. We test our method on seven testing benchmarks to conduct plenty of analytical and evaluated experiments. Thanks to our designed context-sensitive decomposition connection, we successfully realized excellent enhanced results, which fully indicates our superiority against existing state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, considering the practical needs for high-efficiency, we develop a lightweight CSDNet (named LiteCSDNet) by reducing the number of channels. Further, by sharing an encoder for these two components, we obtain a more lightweight version (SLiteCSDNet for short). SLiteCSDNet just contains 0.0301M parameters but achieves the almost same performance as CSDNet.      
### 72.Come-Closer-Diffuse-Faster: Accelerating Conditional Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems through Stochastic Contraction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05146.pdf)
>  Diffusion models have recently attained significant interest within the community owing to their strong performance as generative models. Furthermore, its application to inverse problems have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. Unfortunately, diffusion models have a critical downside - they are inherently slow to sample from, needing few thousand steps of iteration to generate images from pure Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that starting from Gaussian noise is unnecessary. Instead, starting from a single forward diffusion with better initialization significantly reduces the number of sampling steps in the reverse conditional diffusion. This phenomenon is formally explained by the contraction theory of the stochastic difference equations like our conditional diffusion strategy - the alternating applications of reverse diffusion followed by a non-expansive data consistency step. The new sampling strategy, dubbed Come-Closer-Diffuse-Faster (CCDF), also reveals a new insight on how the existing feed-forward neural network approaches for inverse problems can be synergistically combined with the diffusion models. Experimental results with super-resolution, image inpainting, and compressed sensing MRI demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance at significantly reduced sampling steps.
