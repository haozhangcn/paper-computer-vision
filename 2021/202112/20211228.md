### 1.Temporally Constrained Neural Networks (TCNN): A framework for semi-supervised video semantic segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13815.pdf)
>  A major obstacle to building models for effective semantic segmentation, and particularly video semantic segmentation, is a lack of large and well annotated datasets. This bottleneck is particularly prohibitive in highly specialized and regulated fields such as medicine and surgery, where video semantic segmentation could have important applications but data and expert annotations are scarce. In these settings, temporal clues and anatomical constraints could be leveraged during training to improve performance. Here, we present Temporally Constrained Neural Networks (TCNN), a semi-supervised framework used for video semantic segmentation of surgical videos. In this work, we show that autoencoder networks can be used to efficiently provide both spatial and temporal supervisory signals to train deep learning models. We test our method on a newly introduced video dataset of laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures, Endoscapes, and an adaptation of a public dataset of cataract surgeries, CaDIS. We demonstrate that lower-dimensional representations of predicted masks can be leveraged to provide a consistent improvement on both sparsely labeled datasets with no additional computational cost at inference time. Further, the TCNN framework is model-agnostic and can be used in conjunction with other model design choices with minimal additional complexity.      
### 2.Improving Deep Image Matting Via Local Smoothness Assumption  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13809.pdf)
>  Natural image matting is a fundamental and challenging computer vision task. Conventionally, the problem is formulated as an underconstrained problem. Since the problem is ill-posed, further assumptions on the data distribution are required to make the problem well-posed. For classical matting methods, a commonly adopted assumption is the local smoothness assumption on foreground and background colors. However, the use of such assumptions was not systematically considered for deep learning based matting methods. In this work, we consider two local smoothness assumptions which can help improving deep image matting models. Based on the local smoothness assumptions, we propose three techniques, i.e., training set refinement, color augmentation and backpropagating refinement, which can improve the performance of the deep image matting model significantly. We conduct experiments to examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method has favorable performance compared with existing matting methods.      
### 3.MSeg: A Composite Dataset for Multi-domain Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13762.pdf)
>  We present MSeg, a composite dataset that unifies semantic segmentation datasets from different domains. A naive merge of the constituent datasets yields poor performance due to inconsistent taxonomies and annotation practices. We reconcile the taxonomies and bring the pixel-level annotations into alignment by relabeling more than 220,000 object masks in more than 80,000 images, requiring more than 1.34 years of collective annotator effort. The resulting composite dataset enables training a single semantic segmentation model that functions effectively across domains and generalizes to datasets that were not seen during training. We adopt zero-shot cross-dataset transfer as a benchmark to systematically evaluate a model's robustness and show that MSeg training yields substantially more robust models in comparison to training on individual datasets or naive mixing of datasets without the presented contributions. A model trained on MSeg ranks first on the WildDash-v1 leaderboard for robust semantic segmentation, with no exposure to WildDash data during training. We evaluate our models in the 2020 Robust Vision Challenge (RVC) as an extreme generalization experiment. MSeg training sets include only three of the seven datasets in the RVC; more importantly, the evaluation taxonomy of RVC is different and more detailed. Surprisingly, our model shows competitive performance and ranks second. To evaluate how close we are to the grand aim of robust, efficient, and complete scene understanding, we go beyond semantic segmentation by training instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation models using our dataset. Moreover, we also evaluate various engineering design decisions and metrics, including resolution and computational efficiency. Although our models are far from this grand aim, our comprehensive evaluation is crucial for progress. We share all the models and code with the community.      
### 4.Multi-Domain Balanced Sampling Improves Out-of-Generalization of Chest X-ray Pathology Prediction Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13734.pdf)
>  Learning models that generalize under different distribution shifts in medical imaging has been a long-standing research challenge. There have been several proposals for efficient and robust visual representation learning among vision research practitioners, especially in the sensitive and critical biomedical domain. In this paper, we propose an idea for out-of-distribution generalization of chest X-ray pathologies that uses a simple balanced batch sampling technique. We observed that balanced sampling between the multiple training datasets improves the performance over baseline models trained without balancing.      
### 5.A Multi-channel Training Method Boost the Performance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13727.pdf)
>  Deep convolutional neural network has made huge revolution and shown its superior performance on computer vision tasks such as classification and segmentation. Recent years, researches devote much effort to scaling down size of network while maintaining its ability, to adapt to the limited memory on embedded systems like mobile phone. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel training procedure which can highly facilitate the performance and robust of the target network. The proposed procedure contains two sets of networks and two information pipelines which can work independently hinge on the computation ability of the embedded platform, while in the mean time, the classification accuracy is also admirably enhanced.      
### 6.SmoothNet: A Plug-and-Play Network for Refining Human Poses in Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13715.pdf)
>  When analyzing human motion videos, the output jitters from existing pose estimators are highly-unbalanced. Most frames only suffer from slight jitters, while significant jitters occur in those frames with occlusion or poor image quality. Such complex poses often persist in videos, leading to consecutive frames with poor estimation results and large jitters. Existing pose smoothing solutions based on temporal convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, or low-pass filters cannot deal with such a long-term jitter problem without considering the significant and persistent errors within the jittering video segment. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel plug-and-play refinement network, namely SMOOTHNET, which can be attached to any existing pose estimators to improve its temporal smoothness and enhance its per-frame precision simultaneously. Especially, SMOOTHNET is a simple yet effective data-driven fully-connected network with large receptive fields, effectively mitigating the impact of long-term jitters with unreliable estimation results. We conduct extensive experiments on twelve backbone networks with seven datasets across 2D and 3D pose estimation, body recovery, and downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SMOOTHNET consistently outperforms existing solutions, especially on those clips with high errors and long-term jitters.      
### 7.Active Learning with Pseudo-Labels for Multi-View 3D Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13709.pdf)
>  Pose estimation of the human body/hand is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and learning-based solutions require a large amount of annotated data. Given limited annotation budgets, a common approach to increasing label efficiency is Active Learning (AL), which selects examples with the highest value to annotate, but choosing the selection strategy is often nontrivial. <br>In this work, we improve Active Learning for the problem of 3D pose estimation in a multi-view setting, which is of increasing importance in many application scenarios. We develop a framework that allows us to efficiently extend existing single-view AL strategies, and then propose two novel AL strategies that make full use of multi-view geometry. Moreover, we demonstrate additional performance gains by incorporating predicted pseudo-labels, which is a form of self-training. Our system significantly outperforms baselines in 3D body and hand pose estimation on two large-scale benchmarks: CMU Panoptic Studio and InterHand2.6M. Notably, on CMU Panoptic Studio, we are able to match the performance of a fully-supervised model using only 20% of labeled training data.      
### 8.Visual Place Representation and Recognition from Depth Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13707.pdf)
>  This work proposes a new method for place recognition based on the scene architecture. From depth video, we compute the 3D model and we derive and describe geometrically the 2D map from which the scene descriptor is deduced to constitute the core of the proposed algorithm. The obtained results show the efficiency and the robustness of the propounded descriptor to scene appearance changes and light variations.      
### 9.Multi-Image Visual Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13706.pdf)
>  While a lot of work has been done on developing models to tackle the problem of Visual Question Answering, the ability of these models to relate the question to the image features still remain less explored. We present an empirical study of different feature extraction methods with different loss functions. We propose New dataset for the task of Visual Question Answering with multiple image inputs having only one ground truth, and benchmark our results on them. Our final model utilising Resnet + RCNN image features and Bert embeddings, inspired from stacked attention network gives 39% word accuracy and 99% image accuracy on CLEVER+TinyImagenet dataset.      
### 10.Weakly Supervised Visual-Auditory Saliency Detection with Multigranularity Perception  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13697.pdf)
>  Thanks to the rapid advances in deep learning techniques and the wide availability of large-scale training sets, the performance of video saliency detection models has been improving steadily and significantly. However, deep learning-based visualaudio fixation prediction is still in its infancy. At present, only a few visual-audio sequences have been furnished, with real fixations being recorded in real visual-audio environments. Hence, it would be neither efficient nor necessary to recollect real fixations under the same visual-audio circumstances. To address this problem, this paper promotes a novel approach in a weakly supervised manner to alleviate the demand of large-scale training sets for visual-audio model training. By using only the video category tags, we propose the selective class activation mapping (SCAM) and its upgrade (SCAM+). In the spatial-temporal-audio circumstance, the former follows a coarse-to-fine strategy to select the most discriminative regions, and these regions are usually capable of exhibiting high consistency with the real human-eye fixations. The latter equips the SCAM with an additional multi-granularity perception mechanism, making the whole process more consistent with that of the real human visual system. Moreover, we distill knowledge from these regions to obtain complete new spatial-temporal-audio (STA) fixation prediction (FP) networks, enabling broad applications in cases where video tags are not available. Without resorting to any real human-eye fixation, the performances of these STA FP networks are comparable to those of fully supervised networks.

### 11.Augmenting Convolutional networks with attention-based aggregation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13692.pdf)
>  We show how to augment any convolutional network with an attention-based global map to achieve non-local reasoning. We replace the final average pooling by an attention-based aggregation layer akin to a single transformer block, that weights how the patches are involved in the classification decision. We plug this learned aggregation layer with a simplistic patch-based convolutional network parametrized by 2 parameters (width and depth). In contrast with a pyramidal design, this architecture family maintains the input patch resolution across all the layers. It yields surprisingly competitive trade-offs between accuracy and complexity, in particular in terms of memory consumption, as shown by our experiments on various computer vision tasks: object classification, image segmentation and detection.      
### 12.AdaptivePose: Human Parts as Adaptive Points  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13635.pdf)
>  Multi-person pose estimation methods generally follow top-down and bottom-up paradigms, both of which can be considered as two-stage approaches thus leading to the high computation cost and low efficiency. Towards a compact and efficient pipeline for multi-person pose estimation task, in this paper, we propose to represent the human parts as points and present a novel body representation, which leverages an adaptive point set including the human center and seven human-part related points to represent the human instance in a more fine-grained manner. The novel representation is more capable of capturing the various pose deformation and adaptively factorizes the long-range center-to-joint displacement thus delivers a single-stage differentiable network to more precisely regress multi-person pose, termed as AdaptivePose. For inference, our proposed network eliminates the grouping as well as refinements and only needs a single-step disentangling process to form multi-person pose. Without any bells and whistles, we achieve the best speed-accuracy trade-offs of 67.4% AP / 29.4 fps with DLA-34 and 71.3% AP / 9.1 fps with HRNet-W48 on COCO test-dev dataset.      
### 13.An Empirical Study of Adder Neural Networks for Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13608.pdf)
>  Adder neural networks (AdderNets) have shown impressive performance on image classification with only addition operations, which are more energy efficient than traditional convolutional neural networks built with multiplications. Compared with classification, there is a strong demand on reducing the energy consumption of modern object detectors via AdderNets for real-world applications such as autonomous driving and face detection. In this paper, we present an empirical study of AdderNets for object detection. We first reveal that the batch normalization statistics in the pre-trained adder backbone should not be frozen, since the relatively large feature variance of AdderNets. Moreover, we insert more shortcut connections in the neck part and design a new feature fusion architecture for avoiding the sparse features of adder layers. We present extensive ablation studies to explore several design choices of adder detectors. Comparisons with state-of-the-arts are conducted on COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks. Specifically, the proposed Adder FCOS achieves a 37.8\% AP on the COCO val set, demonstrating comparable performance to that of the convolutional counterpart with an about $1.4\times$ energy reduction.      
### 14.Multimodal Image Synthesis and Editing: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13592.pdf)
>  As information exists in various modalities in real world, effective interaction and fusion among multimodal information plays a key role for the creation and perception of multimodal data in computer vision and deep learning research. With superb power in modelling the interaction among multimodal information, multimodal image synthesis and editing have become a hot research topic in recent years. Different from traditional visual guidance which provides explicit clues, multimodal guidance offers intuitive and flexible means in image synthesis and editing. On the other hand, this field is also facing several challenges in alignment of features with inherent modality gaps, synthesis of high-resolution images, faithful evaluation metrics, etc. In this survey, we comprehensively contextualize the advance of the recent multimodal image synthesis \&amp; editing and formulate taxonomies according to data modality and model architectures. We start with an introduction to different types of guidance modalities in image synthesis and editing. We then describe multimodal image synthesis and editing approaches extensively with detailed frameworks including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), GAN Inversion, Transformers, and other methods such as NeRF and Diffusion models. This is followed by a comprehensive description of benchmark datasets and corresponding evaluation metrics as widely adopted in multimodal image synthesis and editing, as well as detailed comparisons of different synthesis methods with analysis of respective advantages and limitations. Finally, we provide insights into the current research challenges and possible future research directions.

### 15.Vegetation Stratum Occupancy Prediction from Airborne LiDAR 3D Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13583.pdf)
>  We propose a new deep learning-based method for estimating the occupancy of vegetation strata from 3D point clouds captured from an aerial platform. Our model predicts rasterized occupancy maps for three vegetation strata: lower, medium, and higher strata. Our training scheme allows our network to only being supervized with values aggregated over cylindrical plots, which are easier to produce than pixel-wise or point-wise annotations. Our method outperforms handcrafted and deep learning baselines in terms of precision while simultaneously providing visual and interpretable predictions. We provide an open-source implementation of our method along along a dataset of 199 agricultural plots to train and evaluate occupancy regression algorithms.      
### 16.Hard Example Guided Hashing for Image Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13565.pdf)
>  Compared with the traditional hashing methods, deep hashing methods generate hash codes with rich semantic information and greatly improves the performances in the image retrieval field. However, it is unsatisfied for current deep hashing methods to predict the similarity of hard examples. It exists two main factors affecting the ability of learning hard examples, which are weak key features extraction and the shortage of hard examples. In this paper, we give a novel end-to-end model to extract the key feature from hard examples and obtain hash code with the accurate semantic information. In addition, we redesign a hard pair-wise loss function to assess the hard degree and update penalty weights of examples. It effectively alleviates the shortage problem in hard examples. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that our model outperformances the mainstream hashing-based image retrieval methods.      
### 17.Learning Robust and Lightweight Model through Separable Structured Transformations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13551.pdf)
>  With the proliferation of mobile devices and the Internet of Things, deep learning models are increasingly deployed on devices with limited computing resources and memory, and are exposed to the threat of adversarial noise. Learning deep models with both lightweight and robustness is necessary for these equipments. However, current deep learning solutions are difficult to learn a model that possesses these two properties without degrading one or the other. As is well known, the fully-connected layers contribute most of the parameters of convolutional neural networks. We perform a separable structural transformation of the fully-connected layer to reduce the parameters, where the large-scale weight matrix of the fully-connected layer is decoupled by the tensor product of several separable small-sized matrices. Note that data, such as images, no longer need to be flattened before being fed to the fully-connected layer, retaining the valuable spatial geometric information of the data. Moreover, in order to further enhance both lightweight and robustness, we propose a joint constraint of sparsity and differentiable condition number, which is imposed on these separable matrices. We evaluate the proposed approach on MLP, VGG-16 and Vision Transformer. The experimental results on datasets such as ImageNet, SVHN, CIFAR-100 and CIFAR10 show that we successfully reduce the amount of network parameters by 90%, while the robust accuracy loss is less than 1.5%, which is better than the SOTA methods based on the original fully-connected layer. Interestingly, it can achieve an overwhelming advantage even at a high compression rate, e.g., 200 times.      
### 18.Responsive Listening Head Generation: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13548.pdf)
>  Responsive listening during face-to-face conversations is a critical element of social interaction and is well established in psychological research. Through non-verbal signals response to the speakers' words, intonations, or behaviors in real-time, listeners show how they are engaged in dialogue. In this work, we build the Responsive Listener Dataset (RLD), a conversation video corpus collected from the public resources featuring 67 speakers, 76 listeners with three different attitudes. We define the responsive listening head generation task as the synthesis of a non-verbal head with motions and expressions reacting to the multiple inputs, including the audio and visual signal of the speaker. Unlike speech-driven gesture or talking head generation, we introduce more modals in this task, hoping to benefit several research fields, including human-to-human interaction, video-to-video translation, cross-modal understanding, and generation. Furthermore, we release an attitude conditioned listening head generation baseline.

### 19.PRIME: A Few Primitives Can Boost Robustness to Common Corruptions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13547.pdf)
>  Despite their impressive performance on image classification tasks, deep networks have a hard time generalizing to many common corruptions of their data. To fix this vulnerability, prior works have mostly focused on increasing the complexity of their training pipelines, combining multiple methods, in the name of diversity. However, in this work, we take a step back and follow a principled approach to achieve robustness to common corruptions. We propose PRIME, a general data augmentation scheme that consists of simple families of max-entropy image transformations. We show that PRIME outperforms the prior art for corruption robustness, while its simplicity and plug-and-play nature enables it to be combined with other methods to further boost their robustness. Furthermore, we analyze PRIME to shed light on the importance of the mixing strategy on synthesizing corrupted images, and to reveal the robustness-accuracy trade-offs arising in the context of common corruptions. Finally, we show that the computational efficiency of our method allows it to be easily used in both on-line and off-line data augmentation schemes.      
### 20.ViR:the Vision Reservoir  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13545.pdf)
>  The most recent year has witnessed the success of applying the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. However, there are still evidences indicating that ViT often suffers following two aspects, i) the high computation and the memory burden from applying the multiple Transformer layers for pre-training on a large-scale dataset, ii) the over-fitting when training on small datasets from scratch. To address these problems, a novel method, namely, Vision Reservoir computing (ViR), is proposed here for image classification, as a parallel to ViT. By splitting each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length, the ViR constructs a pure reservoir with a nearly fully connected topology to replace the Transformer module in ViT. Two kinds of deep ViR models are subsequently proposed to enhance the network performance. Comparative experiments between the ViR and the ViT are carried out on several image classification benchmarks. Without any pre-training process, the ViR outperforms the ViT in terms of both model and computational complexity. Specifically, the number of parameters of the ViR is about 15% even 5% of the ViT, and the memory footprint is about 20% to 40% of the ViT. The superiority of the ViR performance is explained by Small-World characteristics, Lyapunov exponents, and memory capacity.      
### 21.Image Edge Restoring Filter  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13540.pdf)
>  In computer vision, image processing and computer graphics, image smoothing filtering is a very basic and important task and to be expected possessing good edge-preserving smoothing property. Here we address the problem that the edge-preserving ability of many popular local smoothing filters needs to be improved. In this paper, we propose the image Edge Restoring Filter (ERF) to restore the blur edge pixels in the output of local smoothing filters to be clear. The proposed filter can been implemented after many local smoothing filter (such as Box filter, Gaussian filter, Bilateral Filter, Guided Filter and so on). The combinations of "original local smoothing filters + ERF" have better edge-preserving smoothing property than the original local smoothing filters. Experiments on image smoothing, image denoising and image enhancement demonstrate the excellent edges restoring ability of the proposed filter and good edgepreserving smoothing property of the combination "original local smoothing filters + ERF". The proposed filter would benefit a great variety of applications given that smoothing filtering is a high frequently used and fundamental operation.      
### 22.Few-Shot Classification in Unseen Domains by Episodic Meta-Learning Across Visual Domains  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13539.pdf)
>  Few-shot classification aims to carry out classification given only few labeled examples for the categories of interest. Though several approaches have been proposed, most existing few-shot learning (FSL) models assume that base and novel classes are drawn from the same data domain. When it comes to recognizing novel-class data in an unseen domain, this becomes an even more challenging task of domain generalized few-shot classification. In this paper, we present a unique learning framework for domain-generalized few-shot classification, where base classes are from homogeneous multiple source domains, while novel classes to be recognized are from target domains which are not seen during training. By advancing meta-learning strategies, our learning framework exploits data across multiple source domains to capture domain-invariant features, with FSL ability introduced by metric-learning based mechanisms across support and query data. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed learning framework and show learning from small yet homogeneous source data is able to perform preferably against learning from large-scale one. Moreover, we provide insights into choices of backbone models for domain-generalized few-shot classification.      
### 23.Meta-Learned Feature Critics for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13538.pdf)
>  How to handle domain shifts when recognizing or segmenting visual data across domains has been studied by learning and vision communities. In this paper, we address domain generalized semantic segmentation, in which the segmentation model is trained on multiple source domains and is expected to generalize to unseen data domains. We propose a novel meta-learning scheme with feature disentanglement ability, which derives domain-invariant features for semantic segmentation with domain generalization guarantees. In particular, we introduce a class-specific feature critic module in our framework, enforcing the disentangled visual features with domain generalization guarantees. Finally, our quantitative results on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed model, performing favorably against state-of-the-art domain adaptation and generalization methods in segmentation.      
### 24.Adversarial Attack for Asynchronous Event-based Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13534.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples that are carefully designed to cause the deep learning model to make mistakes. Adversarial examples of 2D images and 3D point clouds have been extensively studied, but studies on event-based data are limited. Event-based data can be an alternative to a 2D image under high-speed movements, such as autonomous driving. However, the given adversarial events make the current deep learning model vulnerable to safety issues. In this work, we generate adversarial examples and then train the robust models for event-based data, for the first time. Our algorithm shifts the time of the original events and generates additional adversarial events. Additional adversarial events are generated in two stages. First, null events are added to the event-based data to generate additional adversarial events. The perturbation size can be controlled with the number of null events. Second, the location and time of additional adversarial events are set to mislead DNNs in a gradient-based attack. Our algorithm achieves an attack success rate of 97.95\% on the N-Caltech101 dataset. Furthermore, the adversarial training model improves robustness on the adversarial event data compared to the original model.      
### 25.Learning Generative Vision Transformer with Energy-Based Latent Space for Saliency Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13528.pdf)
>  Vision transformer networks have shown superiority in many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we take a step further by proposing a novel generative vision transformer with latent variables following an informative energy-based prior for salient object detection. Both the vision transformer network and the energy-based prior model are jointly trained via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based maximum likelihood estimation, in which the sampling from the intractable posterior and prior distributions of the latent variables are performed by Langevin dynamics. Further, with the generative vision transformer, we can easily obtain a pixel-wise uncertainty map from an image, which indicates the model confidence in predicting saliency from the image. Different from the existing generative models which define the prior distribution of the latent variables as a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution, our model uses an energy-based informative prior which can be more expressive to capture the latent space of the data. We apply the proposed framework to both RGB and RGB-D salient object detection tasks. Extensive experimental results show that our framework can achieve not only accurate saliency predictions but also meaningful uncertainty maps that are consistent with the human perception.      
### 26.Dual Contrastive Learning for General Face Forgery Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13522.pdf)
>  With various facial manipulation techniques arising, face forgery detection has drawn growing attention due to security concerns. Previous works always formulate face forgery detection as a classification problem based on cross-entropy loss, which emphasizes category-level differences rather than the essential discrepancies between real and fake faces, limiting model generalization in unseen domains. To address this issue, we propose a novel face forgery detection framework, named Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL), which specially constructs positive and negative paired data and performs designed contrastive learning at different granularities to learn generalized feature representation. Concretely, combined with the hard sample selection strategy, Inter-Instance Contrastive Learning (Inter-ICL) is first proposed to promote task-related discriminative features learning by especially constructing instance pairs. Moreover, to further explore the essential discrepancies, Intra-Instance Contrastive Learning (Intra-ICL) is introduced to focus on the local content inconsistencies prevalent in the forged faces by constructing local-region pairs inside instances. Extensive experiments and visualizations on several datasets demonstrate the generalization of our method against the state-of-the-art competitors.      
### 27.Estimating Parameters of the Tree Root in Heterogeneous Soil Environments via Mask-Guided Multi-Polarimetric Integration Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13494.pdf)
>  Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been used as a non-destructive tool for tree root inspection. Estimating root-related parameters from GPR radargrams greatly facilitates root health monitoring and imaging. However, the task of estimating root-related parameters is challenging as the root reflection is a complex function of multiple root parameters and root orientations. Existing methods can only estimate a single root parameter at a time without considering the influence of other parameters and root orientations, resulting in limited estimation accuracy under different root conditions. In addition, soil heterogeneity introduces clutter in GPR radargrams, making the data processing and interpretation even harder. To address these issues, a novel neural network architecture, called mask-guided multi-polarimetric integration neural network (MMI-Net), is proposed to automatically and simultaneously estimate multiple root-related parameters in heterogeneous soil environments. The MMI-Net includes two sub-networks: a MaskNet that predicts a mask to highlight the root reflection area to eliminate interfering environmental clutter, and a ParaNet that uses the predicted mask as guidance to integrate, extract, and emphasize informative features in multi-polarimetric radargrams for accurate estimation of five key root-related parameters. The parameters include the root depth, diameter, relative permittivity, horizontal and vertical orientation angles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MMI-Net achieves high estimation accuracy in these root-related parameters. This is the first work that takes the combined contributions of root parameters and spatial orientations into account and simultaneously estimates multiple root-related parameters.

### 28.Vision Transformer for Small-Size Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13492.pdf)
>  Recently, the Vision Transformer (ViT), which applied the transformer structure to the image classification task, has outperformed convolutional neural networks. However, the high performance of the ViT results from pre-training using a large-size dataset such as JFT-300M, and its dependence on a large dataset is interpreted as due to low locality inductive bias. This paper proposes Shifted Patch Tokenization (SPT) and Locality Self-Attention (LSA), which effectively solve the lack of locality inductive bias and enable it to learn from scratch even on small-size datasets. Moreover, SPT and LSA are generic and effective add-on modules that are easily applicable to various ViTs. Experimental results show that when both SPT and LSA were applied to the ViTs, the performance improved by an average of 2.96% in Tiny-ImageNet, which is a representative small-size dataset. Especially, Swin Transformer achieved an overwhelming performance improvement of 4.08% thanks to the proposed SPT and LSA.      
### 29.A Compact Neural Network-based Algorithm for Robust Image Watermarking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13491.pdf)
>  Digital image watermarking seeks to protect the digital media information from unauthorized access, where the message is embedded into the digital image and extracted from it, even some noises or distortions are applied under various data processing including lossy image compression and interactive content editing. Traditional image watermarking solutions easily suffer from robustness when specified with some prior constraints, while recent deep learning-based watermarking methods could not tackle the information loss problem well under various separate pipelines of feature encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose a novel digital image watermarking solution with a compact neural network, named Invertible Watermarking Network (IWN). Our IWN architecture is based on a single Invertible Neural Network (INN), this bijective propagation framework enables us to effectively solve the challenge of message embedding and extraction simultaneously, by taking them as a pair of inverse problems for each other and learning a stable invertible mapping. In order to enhance the robustness of our watermarking solution, we specifically introduce a simple but effective bit message normalization module to condense the bit message to be embedded, and a noise layer is designed to simulate various practical attacks under our IWN framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our solution under various distortions.      
### 30.Video Joint Modelling Based on Hierarchical Transformer for Co-summarization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13478.pdf)
>  Video summarization aims to automatically generate a summary (storyboard or video skim) of a video, which can facilitate large-scale video retrieving and browsing. Most of the existing methods perform video summarization on individual videos, which neglects the correlations among similar videos. Such correlations, however, are also informative for video understanding and video summarization. To address this limitation, we propose Video Joint Modelling based on Hierarchical Transformer (VJMHT) for co-summarization, which takes into consideration the semantic dependencies across videos. Specifically, VJMHT consists of two layers of Transformer: the first layer extracts semantic representation from individual shots of similar videos, while the second layer performs shot-level video joint modelling to aggregate cross-video semantic information. By this means, complete cross-video high-level patterns are explicitly modelled and learned for the summarization of individual videos. Moreover, Transformer-based video representation reconstruction is introduced to maximize the high-level similarity between the summary and the original video. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modules and the superiority of VJMHT in terms of F-measure and rank-based evaluation.      
### 31.PreDisM: Pre-Disaster Modelling With CNN Ensembles for At-Risk Communities  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13465.pdf)
>  The machine learning community has recently had increased interest in the climate and disaster damage domain due to a marked increased occurrences of natural hazards (e.g., hurricanes, forest fires, floods, earthquakes). However, not enough attention has been devoted to mitigating probable destruction from impending natural hazards. We explore this crucial space by predicting building-level damages on a before-the-fact basis that would allow state actors and non-governmental organizations to be best equipped with resource distribution to minimize or preempt losses. We introduce PreDisM that employs an ensemble of ResNets and fully connected layers over decision trees to capture image-level and meta-level information to accurately estimate weakness of man-made structures to disaster-occurrences. Our model performs well and is responsive to tuning across types of disasters and highlights the space of preemptive hazard damage modelling.      
### 32.AlertTrap: A study on object detection in remote insects trap monitoring system using on-the-edge deep learning platform  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13341.pdf)
>  Fruit flies are one of the most harmful insect species to fruit yields. In AlertTrap, implementation of SSD architecture with different state-of-the-art backbone feature extractors such as MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 appear to be potential solutions for the real-time detection problem. SSD-MobileNetV1 and SSD-MobileNetV2 perform well and result in AP@0.5 of 0.957 and 1.0 respectively. YOLOv4-tiny outperforms the SSD family with 1.0 in AP@0.5; however, its throughput velocity is slightly slower.      
### 33.Continuous Offline Handwriting Recognition using Deep Learning Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13328.pdf)
>  Handwritten text recognition is an open problem of great interest in the area of automatic document image analysis. The transcription of handwritten content present in digitized documents is significant in analyzing historical archives or digitizing information from handwritten documents, forms, and communications. In the last years, great advances have been made in this area due to applying deep learning techniques to its resolution. This Thesis addresses the offline continuous handwritten text recognition (HTR) problem, consisting of developing algorithms and models capable of transcribing the text present in an image without the need for the text to be segmented into characters. For this purpose, we have proposed a new recognition model based on integrating two types of deep learning architectures: convolutional neural networks (CNN) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, respectively. The convolutional component of the model is oriented to identify relevant features present in characters, and the seq2seq component builds the transcription of the text by modeling the sequential nature of the text. For the design of this new model, an extensive analysis of the capabilities of different convolutional architectures in the simplified problem of isolated character recognition has been carried out in order to identify the most suitable ones to be integrated into the continuous model. Additionally, extensive experimentation of the proposed model for the continuous problem has been carried out to determine its robustness to changes in parameterization. The generalization capacity of the model has also been validated by evaluating it on three handwritten text databases using different languages: IAM in English, RIMES in French, and Osborne in Spanish, respectively. The new proposed model provides competitive results with those obtained with other well-established methodologies.      
### 34.Miti-DETR: Object Detection based on Transformers with Mitigatory Self-Attention Convergence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13310.pdf)
>  Object Detection with Transformers (DETR) and related works reach or even surpass the highly-optimized Faster-RCNN baseline with self-attention network architectures. Inspired by the evidence that pure self-attention possesses a strong inductive bias that leads to the transformer losing the expressive power with respect to network depth, we propose a transformer architecture with a mitigatory self-attention mechanism by applying possible direct mapping connections in the transformer architecture to mitigate the rank collapse so as to counteract feature expression loss and enhance the model performance. We apply this proposal in object detection tasks and develop a model named Miti-DETR. Miti-DETR reserves the inputs of each single attention layer to the outputs of that layer so that the "non-attention" information has participated in any attention propagation. The formed residual self-attention network addresses two critical issues: (1) stop the self-attention networks from degenerating to rank-1 to the maximized degree; and (2) further diversify the path distribution of parameter update so that easier attention learning is expected. Miti-DETR significantly enhances the average detection precision and convergence speed towards existing DETR-based models on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, the proposed transformer with the residual self-attention network can be easily generalized or plugged in other related task models without specific customization.      
### 35.Unsupervised Clustering Active Learning for Person Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13308.pdf)
>  Supervised person re-identification (re-id) approaches require a large amount of pairwise manual labeled data, which is not applicable in most real-world scenarios for re-id deployment. On the other hand, unsupervised re-id methods rely on unlabeled data to train models but performs poorly compared with supervised re-id methods. In this work, we aim to combine unsupervised re-id learning with a small number of human annotations to achieve a competitive performance. Towards this goal, we present a Unsupervised Clustering Active Learning (UCAL) re-id deep learning approach. It is capable of incrementally discovering the representative centroid-pairs and requiring human annotate them. These few labeled representative pairwise data can improve the unsupervised representation learning model with other large amounts of unlabeled data. More importantly, because the representative centroid-pairs are selected for annotation, UCAL can work with very low-cost human effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art active learning methods on three re-id benchmark datasets.      
### 36.Semantic Clustering based Deduction Learning for Image Recognition and Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13165.pdf)
>  The paper proposes a semantic clustering based deduction learning by mimicking the learning and thinking process of human brains. Human beings can make judgments based on experience and cognition, and as a result, no one would recognize an unknown animal as a car. Inspired by this observation, we propose to train deep learning models using the clustering prior that can guide the models to learn with the ability of semantic deducing and summarizing from classification attributes, such as a cat belonging to animals while a car pertaining to vehicles. %Specifically, if an image is labeled as a cat, then the model is trained to learn that "this image is totally not any random class that is the outlier of animal". The proposed approach realizes the high-level clustering in the semantic space, enabling the model to deduce the relations among various classes during the learning process. In addition, the paper introduces a semantic prior based random search for the opposite labels to ensure the smooth distribution of the clustering and the robustness of the classifiers. The proposed approach is supported theoretically and empirically through extensive experiments. We compare the performance across state-of-the-art classifiers on popular benchmarks, and the generalization ability is verified by adding noisy labeling to the datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.      
### 37.Reconstructing Compact Building Models from Point Clouds Using Deep Implicit Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13142.pdf)
>  Three-dimensional (3D) building models play an increasingly pivotal role in many real-world applications while obtaining a compact representation of buildings remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a novel framework for reconstructing compact, watertight, polygonal building models from point clouds. Our framework comprises three components: (a) a cell complex is generated via adaptive space partitioning that provides a polyhedral embedding as the candidate set; (b) an implicit field is learned by a deep neural network that facilitates building occupancy estimation; (c) a Markov random field is formulated to extract the outer surface of a building via combinatorial optimization. We evaluate and compare our method with state-of-the-art methods in shape reconstruction, surface approximation, and geometry simplification. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world point clouds have demonstrated that, with our neural-guided strategy, high-quality building models can be obtained with significant advantages in fidelity, compactness, and computational efficiency. Our method shows robustness to noise and insufficient measurements, and it can directly generalize from synthetic scans to real-world measurements.      
### 38.Invertible Network for Unpaired Low-light Image Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13107.pdf)
>  Existing unpaired low-light image enhancement approaches prefer to employ the two-way GAN framework, in which two CNN generators are deployed for enhancement and degradation separately. However, such data-driven models ignore the inherent characteristics of transformation between the low and normal light images, leading to unstable training and artifacts. Here, we propose to leverage the invertible network to enhance low-light image in forward process and degrade the normal-light one inversely with unpaired learning. The generated and real images are then fed into discriminators for adversarial learning. In addition to the adversarial loss, we design various loss functions to ensure the stability of training and preserve more image details. Particularly, a reversibility loss is introduced to alleviate the over-exposure problem. Moreover, we present a progressive self-guided enhancement process for low-light images and achieve favorable performance against the SOTAs.      
### 39.SimViT: Exploring a Simple Vision Transformer with sliding windows  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13085.pdf)
>  Although vision Transformers have achieved excellent performance as backbone models in many vision tasks, most of them intend to capture global relations of all tokens in an image or a window, which disrupts the inherent spatial and local correlations between patches in 2D structure. In this paper, we introduce a simple vision Transformer named SimViT, to incorporate spatial structure and local information into the vision Transformers. Specifically, we introduce Multi-head Central Self-Attention(MCSA) instead of conventional Multi-head Self-Attention to capture highly local relations. The introduction of sliding windows facilitates the capture of spatial structure. Meanwhile, SimViT extracts multi-scale hierarchical features from different layers for dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments show the SimViT is effective and efficient as a general-purpose backbone model for various image processing tasks. Especially, our SimViT-Micro only needs 3.3M parameters to achieve 71.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k dataset, which is the smallest size vision Transformer model by now. Our code will be available in <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/ucasligang/SimViT" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 40.Multi-Scale Feature Fusion: Learning Better Semantic Segmentation for Road Pothole Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13082.pdf)
>  This paper presents a novel pothole detection approach based on single-modal semantic segmentation. It first extracts visual features from input images using a convolutional neural network. A channel attention module then reweighs the channel features to enhance the consistency of different feature maps. Subsequently, we employ an atrous spatial pyramid pooling module (comprising of atrous convolutions in series, with progressive rates of dilation) to integrate the spatial context information. This helps better distinguish between potholes and undamaged road areas. Finally, the feature maps in the adjacent layers are fused using our proposed multi-scale feature fusion module. This further reduces the semantic gap between different feature channel layers. Extensive experiments were carried out on the Pothole-600 dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The quantitative comparisons suggest that our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on both RGB images and transformed disparity images, outperforming three SoTA single-modal semantic segmentation networks.      
### 41.Virtuoso: Video-based Intelligence for real-time tuning on SOCs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13076.pdf)
>  Efficient and adaptive computer vision systems have been proposed to make computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection, optimized for embedded or mobile devices. These solutions, quite recent in their origin, focus on optimizing the model (a deep neural network, DNN) or the system by designing an adaptive system with approximation knobs. In spite of several recent efforts, we show that existing solutions suffer from two major drawbacks. First, the system does not consider energy consumption of the models while making a decision on which model to run. Second, the evaluation does not consider the practical scenario of contention on the device, due to other co-resident workloads. In this work, we propose an efficient and adaptive video object detection system, Virtuoso, which is jointly optimized for accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency. Underlying Virtuoso is a multi-branch execution kernel that is capable of running at different operating points in the accuracy-energy-latency axes, and a lightweight runtime scheduler to select the best fit execution branch to satisfy the user requirement. To fairly compare with Virtuoso, we benchmark 15 state-of-the-art or widely used protocols, including Faster R-CNN (FRCNN), YOLO v3, SSD, EfficientDet, SELSA, MEGA, REPP, FastAdapt, and our in-house adaptive variants of FRCNN+, YOLO+, SSD+, and EfficientDet+ (our variants have enhanced efficiency for mobiles). With this comprehensive benchmark, Virtuoso has shown superiority to all the above protocols, leading the accuracy frontier at every efficiency level on NVIDIA Jetson mobile GPUs. Specifically, Virtuoso has achieved an accuracy of 63.9%, which is more than 10% higher than some of the popular object detection models, FRCNN at 51.1%, and YOLO at 49.5%.      
### 42.NIP: Neuron-level Inverse Perturbation Against Adversarial Attacks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13060.pdf)
>  Although deep learning models have achieved unprecedented success, their vulnerabilities towards adversarial attacks have attracted increasing attention, especially when deployed in security-critical domains. To address the challenge, numerous defense strategies, including reactive and proactive ones, have been proposed for robustness improvement. From the perspective of image feature space, some of them cannot reach satisfying results due to the shift of features. Besides, features learned by models are not directly related to classification results. Different from them, We consider defense method essentially from model inside and investigated the neuron behaviors before and after attacks. We observed that attacks mislead the model by dramatically changing the neurons that contribute most and least to the correct label. Motivated by it, we introduce the concept of neuron influence and further divide neurons into front, middle and tail part. Based on it, we propose neuron-level inverse perturbation(NIP), the first neuron-level reactive defense method against adversarial attacks. By strengthening front neurons and weakening those in the tail part, NIP can eliminate nearly all adversarial perturbations while still maintaining high benign accuracy. Besides, it can cope with different sizes of perturbations via adaptivity, especially larger ones. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three datasets and six models show that NIP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines against eleven adversarial attacks. We further provide interpretable proofs via neuron activation and visualization for better understanding.      
### 43.Self-Gated Memory Recurrent Network for Efficient Scalable HDR Deghosting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13050.pdf)
>  We propose a novel recurrent network-based HDR deghosting method for fusing arbitrary length dynamic sequences. The proposed method uses convolutional and recurrent architectures to generate visually pleasing, ghosting-free HDR images. We introduce a new recurrent cell architecture, namely Self-Gated Memory (SGM) cell, that outperforms the standard LSTM cell while containing fewer parameters and having faster running times. In the SGM cell, the information flow through a gate is controlled by multiplying the gate's output by a function of itself. Additionally, we use two SGM cells in a bidirectional setting to improve output quality. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing HDR deghosting methods quantitatively across three publicly available datasets while simultaneously achieving scalability to fuse variable-length input sequence without necessitating re-training. Through extensive ablations, we demonstrate the importance of individual components in our proposed approach.

### 44.Channel-Wise Attention-Based Network for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13047.pdf)
>  Self-supervised learning has shown very promising results for monocular depth estimation. Scene structure and local details both are significant clues for high-quality depth estimation. Recent works suffer from the lack of explicit modeling of scene structure and proper handling of details information, which leads to a performance bottleneck and blurry artefacts in predicted results. In this paper, we propose the Channel-wise Attention-based Depth Estimation Network (CADepth-Net) with two effective contributions: 1) The structure perception module employs the self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and aggregates discriminative features in channel dimensions, explicitly enhances the perception of scene structure, obtains the better scene understanding and rich feature representation. 2) The detail emphasis module re-calibrates channel-wise feature maps and selectively emphasizes the informative features, aiming to highlight crucial local details information and fuse different level features more efficiently, resulting in more precise and sharper depth prediction. Furthermore, the extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method and show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmark and Make3D datasets.      
### 45.Grounding Linguistic Commands to Navigable Regions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13031.pdf)
>  Humans have a natural ability to effortlessly comprehend linguistic commands such as "park next to the yellow sedan" and instinctively know which region of the road the vehicle should navigate. Extending this ability to autonomous vehicles is the next step towards creating fully autonomous agents that respond and act according to human commands. To this end, we propose the novel task of Referring Navigable Regions (RNR), i.e., grounding regions of interest for navigation based on the linguistic command. RNR is different from Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which focuses on grounding an object referred to by the natural language expression instead of grounding a navigable region. For example, for a command "park next to the yellow sedan," RIS will aim to segment the referred sedan, and RNR aims to segment the suggested parking region on the road. We introduce a new dataset, Talk2Car-RegSeg, which extends the existing Talk2car dataset with segmentation masks for the regions described by the linguistic commands. A separate test split with concise manoeuvre-oriented commands is provided to assess the practicality of our dataset. We benchmark the proposed dataset using a novel transformer-based architecture. We present extensive ablations and show superior performance over baselines on multiple evaluation metrics. A downstream path planner generating trajectories based on RNR outputs confirms the efficacy of the proposed framework.      
### 46.Benchmarking Pedestrian Odometry: The Brown Pedestrian Odometry Dataset (BPOD)  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13018.pdf)
>  We present the Brown Pedestrian Odometry Dataset (BPOD) for benchmarking visual odometry algorithms in head-mounted pedestrian settings. This dataset was captured using synchronized global and rolling shutter stereo cameras in 12 diverse indoor and outdoor locations on Brown University's campus. Compared to existing datasets, BPOD contains more image blur and self-rotation, which are common in pedestrian odometry but rare elsewhere. Ground-truth trajectories are generated from stick-on markers placed along the pedestrian's path, and the pedestrian's position is documented using a third-person video. We evaluate the performance of representative direct, feature-based, and learning-based VO methods on BPOD. Our results show that significant development is needed to successfully capture pedestrian trajectories.

### 47.Continuous Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images via Implicit Neural Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13003.pdf)
>  Existing methods for spectral reconstruction usually learn a discrete mapping from RGB images to a number of spectral bands. However, this modeling strategy ignores the continuous nature of spectral signature. In this paper, we propose Neural Spectral Reconstruction (NeSR) to lift this limitation, by introducing a novel continuous spectral representation. To this end, we embrace the concept of implicit function and implement a parameterized embodiment with a neural network. Specifically, we first adopt a backbone network to extract spatial features of RGB inputs. Based on it, we devise Spectral Profile Interpolation (SPI) module and Neural Attention Mapping (NAM) module to enrich deep features, where the spatial-spectral correlation is involved for a better representation. Then, we view the number of sampled spectral bands as the coordinate of continuous implicit function, so as to learn the projection from deep features to spectral intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the distinct advantage of NeSR in reconstruction accuracy over baseline methods. Moreover, NeSR extends the flexibility of spectral reconstruction by enabling an arbitrary number of spectral bands as the target output.      
### 48.US-GAN: On the importance of Ultimate Skip Connection for Facial Expression Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13002.pdf)
>  Recent studies have shown impressive results in multi-domain image-to-image translation for facial expression synthesis. While effective, these methods require a large number of labelled samples for plausible results. Their performance significantly degrades when we train them on smaller datasets. To address this limitation, in this work, we present US-GAN, a smaller and effective method for synthesizing plausible expressions by employing notably smaller datasets. The proposed method comprises of encoding layers, single residual block, decoding layers and an ultimate skip connection that links the input image to an output image. It has three times lesser parameters as compared to state-of-the-art facial expression synthesis methods. Experimental results demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative effectiveness of our proposed method. In addition, we also show that an ultimate skip connection is sufficient for recovering rich facial and overall color details of the input face image that a larger state-of-the-art model fails to recover.      
### 49.Domain-Aware Continual Zero-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12989.pdf)
>  We introduce Domain Aware Continual Zero-Shot Learning (DACZSL), the task of visually recognizing images of unseen categories in unseen domains sequentially. We created DACZSL on top of the DomainNet dataset by dividing it into a sequence of tasks, where classes are incrementally provided on seen domains during training and evaluation is conducted on unseen domains for both seen and unseen classes. We also proposed a novel Domain-Invariant CZSL Network (DIN), which outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models that we adapted to DACZSL setting. We adopt a structure-based approach to alleviate forgetting knowledge from previous tasks with a small per-task private network in addition to a global shared network. To encourage the private network to capture the domain and task-specific representation, we train our model with a novel adversarial knowledge disentanglement setting to make our global network task-invariant and domain-invariant over all the tasks. Our method also learns a class-wise learnable prompt to obtain better class-level text representation, which is used to represent side information to enable zero-shot prediction of future unseen classes. Our code and benchmarks will be made publicly available.      
### 50.iSeg3D: An Interactive 3D Shape Segmentation Tool  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12988.pdf)
>  A large-scale dataset is essential for learning good features in 3D shape understanding, but there are only a few datasets that can satisfy deep learning training. One of the major reasons is that current tools for annotating per-point semantic labels using polygons or scribbles are tedious and inefficient. To facilitate segmentation annotations in 3D shapes, we propose an effective annotation tool, named iSeg for 3D shape. It can obtain a satisfied segmentation result with minimal human clicks (&lt; 10). Under our observation, most objects can be considered as the composition of finite primitive shapes, and we train iSeg3D model on our built primitive-composed shape data to learn the geometric prior knowledge in a self-supervised manner. Given human interactions, the learned knowledge can be used to segment parts on arbitrary shapes, in which positive clicks help associate the primitives into the semantic parts and negative clicks can avoid over-segmentation. Besides, We also provide an online human-in-loop fine-tuning module that enables the model perform better segmentation with less clicks. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of iSeg3D on PartNet shape segmentation. Data and codes will be made publicly available.      
### 51.SGTR: End-to-end Scene Graph Generation with Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12970.pdf)
>  Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging visual understanding task due to its complex compositional property. Most previous works adopt a bottom-up two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers from overhead time complexity or sub-optimal design assumption. In this work, we propose a novel SGG method to address the aforementioned issues, which formulates the task as a bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the problem, we develop a transformer-based end-to-end framework that first generates the entity and predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed edges to form the relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new entity-aware predicate representation based on a structural predicate generator to leverage the compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a graph assembling module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph based on our entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is able to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two challenging benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying higher efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong baseline for the Transformer-based scene graph generation.      
### 52.Deep ensembles in bioimage segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12955.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation consists in classifying each pixel of an image by assigning it to a specific label chosen from a set of all the available ones. During the last few years, a lot of attention shifted to this kind of task. Many computer vision researchers tried to apply autoencoder structures to develop models that can learn the semantics of the image as well as a low-level representation of it. In an autoencoder architecture, given an input, an encoder computes a low dimensional representation of the input that is then used by a decoder to reconstruct the original data. In this work, we propose an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In ensemble methods, many different models are trained and then used for classification, the ensemble aggregates the outputs of the single classifiers. The approach leverages on differences of various classifiers to improve the performance of the whole system. Diversity among the single classifiers is enforced by using different loss functions. In particular, we present a new loss function that results from the combination of Dice and Structural Similarity Index. The proposed ensemble is implemented by combining different backbone networks using the DeepLabV3+ and HarDNet environment. The proposal is evaluated through an extensive empirical evaluation on two real-world scenarios: polyp and skin segmentation.

### 53.Realtime Global Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12939.pdf)
>  In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end realtime global attention neural network (RGANet) for the challenging task of semantic segmentation. Different from the encoding strategy deployed by self-attention paradigms, the proposed global attention module encodes global attention via depth-wise convolution and affine transformations. The integration of these global attention modules into a hierarchy architecture maintains high inferential performance. In addition, an improved evaluation metric, namely MGRID, is proposed to alleviate the negative effect of non-convex, widely scattered ground-truth areas. Results from extensive experiments on state-of-the-art architectures for semantic segmentation manifest the leading performance of proposed approaches for robotic monocular visual perception.      
### 54.Learning Aligned Cross-Modal Representation for Generalized Zero-Shot Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12927.pdf)
>  Learning a common latent embedding by aligning the latent spaces of cross-modal autoencoders is an effective strategy for Generalized Zero-Shot Classification (GZSC). However, due to the lack of fine-grained instance-wise annotations, it still easily suffer from the domain shift problem for the discrepancy between the visual representation of diversified images and the semantic representation of fixed attributes. In this paper, we propose an innovative autoencoder network by learning Aligned Cross-Modal Representations (dubbed ACMR) for GZSC. Specifically, we propose a novel Vision-Semantic Alignment (VSA) method to strengthen the alignment of cross-modal latent features on the latent subspaces guided by a learned classifier. In addition, we propose a novel Information Enhancement Module (IEM) to reduce the possibility of latent variables collapse meanwhile encouraging the discriminative ability of latent variables. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.      
### 55.Not All Voxels Are Equal: Semantic Scene Completion from the Point-Voxel Perspective  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12925.pdf)
>  We revisit Semantic Scene Completion (SSC), a useful task to predict the semantic and occupancy representation of 3D scenes, in this paper. A number of methods for this task are always based on voxelized scene representations for keeping local scene structure. However, due to the existence of visible empty voxels, these methods always suffer from heavy computation redundancy when the network goes deeper, and thus limit the completion quality. To address this dilemma, we propose our novel point-voxel aggregation network for this task. Firstly, we transfer the voxelized scenes to point clouds by removing these visible empty voxels and adopt a deep point stream to capture semantic information from the scene efficiently. Meanwhile, a light-weight voxel stream containing only two 3D convolution layers preserves local structures of the voxelized scenes. Furthermore, we design an anisotropic voxel aggregation operator to fuse the structure details from the voxel stream into the point stream, and a semantic-aware propagation module to enhance the up-sampling process in the point stream by semantic labels. We demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-arts on two benchmarks by a large margin, with only depth images as the input.      
### 56.Multi-initialization Optimization Network for Accurate 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12917.pdf)
>  3D human pose and shape recovery from a monocular RGB image is a challenging task. Existing learning based methods highly depend on weak supervision signals, e.g. 2D and 3D joint location, due to the lack of in-the-wild paired 3D supervision. However, considering the 2D-to-3D ambiguities existed in these weak supervision labels, the network is easy to get stuck in local optima when trained with such labels. In this paper, we reduce the ambituity by optimizing multiple initializations. Specifically, we propose a three-stage framework named Multi-Initialization Optimization Network (MION). In the first stage, we strategically select different coarse 3D reconstruction candidates which are compatible with the 2D keypoints of input sample. Each coarse reconstruction can be regarded as an initialization leads to one optimization branch. In the second stage, we design a mesh refinement transformer (MRT) to respectively refine each coarse reconstruction result via a self-attention mechanism. Finally, a Consistency Estimation Network (CEN) is proposed to find the best result from mutiple candidates by evaluating if the visual evidence in RGB image matches a given 3D reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our Multi-Initialization Optimization Network outperforms existing 3D mesh based methods on multiple public benchmarks.      
### 57.Visual Semantics Allow for Textual Reasoning Better in Scene Text Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12916.pdf)
>  Existing Scene Text Recognition (STR) methods typically use a language model to optimize the joint probability of the 1D character sequence predicted by a visual recognition (VR) model, which ignore the 2D spatial context of visual semantics within and between character instances, making them not generalize well to arbitrary shape scene text. To address this issue, we make the first attempt to perform textual reasoning based on visual semantics in this paper. Technically, given the character segmentation maps predicted by a VR model, we construct a subgraph for each instance, where nodes represent the pixels in it and edges are added between nodes based on their spatial similarity. Then, these subgraphs are sequentially connected by their root nodes and merged into a complete graph. Based on this graph, we devise a graph convolutional network for textual reasoning (GTR) by supervising it with a cross-entropy loss. GTR can be easily plugged in representative STR models to improve their performance owing to better textual reasoning. Specifically, we construct our model, namely S-GTR, by paralleling GTR to the language model in a segmentation-based STR baseline, which can effectively exploit the visual-linguistic complementarity via mutual learning. S-GTR sets new state-of-the-art on six challenging STR benchmarks and generalizes well to multi-linguistic datasets.

### 58.Cluster-guided Image Synthesis with Unconditional Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12911.pdf)
>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the driving force behind the state-of-the-art in image generation. Despite their ability to synthesize high-resolution photo-realistic images, generating content with on-demand conditioning of different granularity remains a challenge. This challenge is usually tackled by annotating massive datasets with the attributes of interest, a laborious task that is not always a viable option. Therefore, it is vital to introduce control into the generation process of unsupervised generative models. In this work, we focus on controllable image generation by leveraging GANs that are well-trained in an unsupervised fashion. To this end, we discover that the representation space of intermediate layers of the generator forms a number of clusters that separate the data according to semantically meaningful attributes (e.g., hair color and pose). By conditioning on the cluster assignments, the proposed method is able to control the semantic class of the generated image. Our approach enables sampling from each cluster by Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). We showcase the efficacy of our approach on faces (CelebA-HQ and FFHQ), animals (Imagenet) and objects (LSUN) using different pre-trained generative models. The results highlight the ability of our approach to condition image generation on attributes like gender, pose and hair style on faces, as well as a variety of features on different object classes.      
### 59.A formal approach to good practices in Pseudo-Labeling for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Re-Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12887.pdf)
>  The use of pseudo-labels prevails in order to tackle Unsupervised Domain Adaptive (UDA) Re-Identification (re-ID) with the best performance. Indeed, this family of approaches has given rise to several UDA re-ID specific frameworks, which are effective. In these works, research directions to improve Pseudo-Labeling UDA re-ID performance are varied and mostly based on intuition and experiments: refining pseudo-labels, reducing the impact of errors in pseudo-labels... It can be hard to deduce from them general good practices, which can be implemented in any Pseudo-Labeling method, to consistently improve its performance. To address this key question, a new theoretical view on Pseudo-Labeling UDA re-ID is proposed. The contributions are threefold: (i) A novel theoretical framework for Pseudo-Labeling UDA re-ID, formalized through a new general learning upper-bound on the UDA re-ID performance. (ii) General good practices for Pseudo-Labeling, directly deduced from the interpretation of the proposed theoretical framework, in order to improve the target re-ID performance. (iii) Extensive experiments on challenging person and vehicle cross-dataset re-ID tasks, showing consistent performance improvements for various state-of-the-art methods and various proposed implementations of good practices.      
### 60.HSPACE: Synthetic Parametric Humans Animated in Complex Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12867.pdf)
>  Advances in the state of the art for 3d human sensing are currently limited by the lack of visual datasets with 3d ground truth, including multiple people, in motion, operating in real-world environments, with complex illumination or occlusion, and potentially observed by a moving camera. Sophisticated scene understanding would require estimating human pose and shape as well as gestures, towards representations that ultimately combine useful metric and behavioral signals with free-viewpoint photo-realistic visualisation capabilities. To sustain progress, we build a large-scale photo-realistic dataset, Human-SPACE (HSPACE), of animated humans placed in complex synthetic indoor and outdoor environments. We combine a hundred diverse individuals of varying ages, gender, proportions, and ethnicity, with hundreds of motions and scenes, as well as parametric variations in body shape (for a total of 1,600 different humans), in order to generate an initial dataset of over 1 million frames. Human animations are obtained by fitting an expressive human body model, GHUM, to single scans of people, followed by novel re-targeting and positioning procedures that support the realistic animation of dressed humans, statistical variation of body proportions, and jointly consistent scene placement of multiple moving people. Assets are generated automatically, at scale, and are compatible with existing real time rendering and game engines. The dataset with evaluation server will be made available for research. Our large-scale analysis of the impact of synthetic data, in connection with real data and weak supervision, underlines the considerable potential for continuing quality improvements and limiting the sim-to-real gap, in this practical setting, in connection with increased model capacity.      
### 61.Understanding the impact of class imbalance on the performance of chest x-ray image classifiers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12843.pdf)
>  This work aims to understand the impact of class imbalance on the performance of chest x-ray classifiers, in light of the standard evaluation practices adopted by researchers in terms of discrimination and calibration performance. Firstly, we conducted a literature study to analyze common scientific practices and confirmed that: (1) even when dealing with highly imbalanced datasets, the community tends to use metrics that are dominated by the majority class; and (2) it is still uncommon to include calibration studies for chest x-ray classifiers, albeit its importance in the context of healthcare. Secondly, we perform a systematic experiment on two major chest x-ray datasets to explore the behavior of several performance metrics under different class ratios and show that widely adopted metrics can conceal the performance in the minority class. Finally, we propose the adoption of two alternative metrics, the precision-recall curve and the Balanced Brier score, which better reflect the performance of the system in such scenarios. Our results indicate that current evaluation practices adopted by the research community for chest x-ray classifiers may not reflect the performance of such systems for computer-aided diagnosis in real clinical scenarios, and suggest alternatives to improve this situation.      
### 62.Dense anomaly detection by robust learning on synthetic negative data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12833.pdf)
>  Standard machine learning is unable to accommodate inputs which do not belong to the training distribution. The resulting models often give rise to confident incorrect predictions which may lead to devastating consequences. This problem is especially demanding in the context of dense prediction since input images may be partially anomalous. Previous work has addressed dense anomaly detection by discriminative training on mixed-content images. We extend this approach with synthetic negative patches which simultaneously achieve high inlier likelihood and uniform discriminative prediction. We generate synthetic negatives with normalizing flows due to their outstanding distribution coverage and capability to generate samples at different resolutions. We also propose to detect anomalies according to a principled information-theoretic criterion which can be consistently applied through training and inference. The resulting models set the new state of the art on standard benchmarks and datasets in spite of minimal computational overhead and refraining from auxiliary negative data.      
### 63.Multi-Camera Sensor Fusion for Visual Odometry using Deep Uncertainty Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12818.pdf)
>  Visual Odometry (VO) estimation is an important source of information for vehicle state estimation and autonomous driving. Recently, deep learning based approaches have begun to appear in the literature. However, in the context of driving, single sensor based approaches are often prone to failure because of degraded image quality due to environmental factors, camera placement, etc. To address this issue, we propose a deep sensor fusion framework which estimates vehicle motion using both pose and uncertainty estimations from multiple on-board cameras. We extract spatio-temporal feature representations from a set of consecutive images using a hybrid CNN - RNN model. We then utilise a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to estimate the 6-DoF pose as a mixture of distributions and a fusion module to estimate the final pose using MDN outputs from multi-cameras. We evaluate our approach on the publicly available, large scale autonomous vehicle dataset, nuScenes. The results show that the proposed fusion approach surpasses the state-of-the-art, and provides robust estimates and accurate trajectories compared to individual camera-based estimations.      
### 64.MDN-VO: Estimating Visual Odometry with Confidence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12812.pdf)
>  Visual Odometry (VO) is used in many applications including robotics and autonomous systems. However, traditional approaches based on feature matching are computationally expensive and do not directly address failure cases, instead relying on heuristic methods to detect failure. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based VO model to efficiently estimate 6-DoF poses, as well as a confidence model for these estimates. We utilise a CNN - RNN hybrid model to learn feature representations from image sequences. We then employ a Mixture Density Network (MDN) which estimates camera motion as a mixture of Gaussians, based on the extracted spatio-temporal representations. Our model uses pose labels as a source of supervision, but derives uncertainties in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate the proposed model on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets and report extensive quantitative and qualitative results to analyse the performance of both pose and uncertainty estimation. Our experiments show that the proposed model exceeds state-of-the-art performance in addition to detecting failure cases using the predicted pose uncertainty.      
### 65.Infant Brain Age Classification: 2D CNN Outperforms 3D CNN in Small Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13811.pdf)
>  Determining if the brain is developing normally is a key component of pediatric neuroradiology and neurology. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of infants demonstrates a specific pattern of development beyond simply myelination. While radiologists have used myelination patterns, brain morphology and size characteristics to determine age-adequate brain maturity, this requires years of experience in pediatric neuroradiology. With no standardized criteria, visual estimation of the structural maturity of the brain from MRI before three years of age remains dominated by inter-observer and intra-observer variability. A more objective estimation of brain developmental age could help physicians identify many neurodevelopmental conditions and diseases earlier and more reliably. Such data, however, is naturally hard to obtain, and the observer ground truth not much of a gold standard due to subjectivity of assessment. In this light, we explore the general feasibility to tackle this task, and the utility of different approaches, including two- and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN) that were trained on a fusion of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density (PD) weighted sequences from 84 individual subjects divided into four age groups from birth to 3 years of age. In the best performing approach, we achieved an accuracy of 0.90 [95% CI:0.86-0.94] using a 2D CNN on a central axial thick slab. We discuss the comparison to 3D networks and show how the performance compares to the use of only one sequence (T1w). In conclusion, despite the theoretical superiority of 3D CNN approaches, in limited-data situations, such approaches are inferior to simpler architectures.

### 66.Radiomic biomarker extracted from PI-RADS 3 patients support more eìcient and robust prostate cancer diagnosis: a multi-center study  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13686.pdf)
>  Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) based on multi-parametric MRI classiêes patients into 5 categories (PI-RADS 1-5) for routine clinical diagnosis guidance. However, there is no consensus on whether PI-RADS 3 patients should go through biopsies. Mining features from these hard samples (HS) is meaningful for physicians to achieve accurate diagnoses. Currently, the mining of HS biomarkers is insuìcient, and the eéectiveness and robustness of HS biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis have not been explored. In this study, biomarkers from diéerent data distributions are constructed. Results show that HS biomarkers can achieve better performances in diéerent data distributions.      
### 67.M2DGR: A Multi-sensor and Multi-scenario SLAM Dataset for Ground Robots  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13659.pdf)
>  We introduce M2DGR: a novel large-scale dataset collected by a ground robot with a full sensor-suite including six fish-eye and one sky-pointing RGB cameras, an infrared camera, an event camera, a Visual-Inertial Sensor (VI-sensor), an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a LiDAR, a consumer-grade Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver and a GNSS-IMU navigation system with real-time kinematic (RTK) signals. All those sensors were well-calibrated and synchronized, and their data were recorded simultaneously. The ground truth trajectories were obtained by the motion capture device, a laser 3D tracker, and an RTK receiver. The dataset comprises 36 sequences (about 1TB) captured in diverse scenarios including both indoor and outdoor environments. We evaluate state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms on M2DGR. Results show that existing solutions perform poorly in some scenarios. For the benefit of the research community, we make the dataset and tools public.

### 68.Self-normalized Classification of Parkinson's Disease DaTscan Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13637.pdf)
>  Classifying SPECT images requires a preprocessing step which normalizes the images using a normalization region. The choice of the normalization region is not standard, and using different normalization regions introduces normalization region-dependent variability. This paper mathematically analyzes the effect of the normalization region to show that normalized-classification is exactly equivalent to a subspace separation of the half rays of the images under multiplicative equivalence. Using this geometry, a new self-normalized classification strategy is proposed. This strategy eliminates the normalizing region altogether. The theory is used to classify DaTscan images of 365 Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects and 208 healthy control (HC) subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). The theory is also used to understand PD progression from baseline to year 4.      
### 69.Generation of Synthetic Rat Brain MRI scans with a 3D Enhanced Alpha-GAN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13626.pdf)
>  Translational brain research using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is becoming increasingly popular as animal models are an essential part of scientific studies and ultra-high-field scanners become more available. Some drawbacks of MRI are MRI scanner availability, and the time needed to perform a full scanning session (it usually takes over 30 minutes). Data protection laws and 3R ethical rule also make it difficult to create large data sets for training Deep Learning models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been shown capable of performing data augmentation with higher quality than other techniques. In this work, the alpha-GAN architecture is used to test its ability to generate realistic 3D MRI scans of the rat brain. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first time an approach based on GANs is used for data augmentation in preclinical data. The generated scans are evaluated using various qualitative and quantitative metrics. A Turing test performed by 4 experts has shown that the generated scans can trick almost any expert. The generated scans were also used to evaluate their impact on the performance of an existing deep learning model developed for rat brain segmentation of white matter, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The models were compared using the Dice score. The best results for the segmentation of whole brain and white matter were achieved when 174 real scans and 348 synthetic ones were used, with improvements of 0.0172 and 0.0129. The use of 174 real scans and 87 synthetic ones led to improvements of 0.0038 and 0.0764 of grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid segmentation. Thus, by using the proposed new normalisation layer and loss functions, it was possible to improve the realism of the generated rat MRI scans and it was demonstrated that using the data generated improved the segmentation model more than using conventional data augmentation.      
### 70.Depth estimation of endoscopy using sim-to-real transfer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13595.pdf)
>  In order to use the navigation system effectively, distance information sensors such as depth sensors are essential. Since depth sensors are difficult to use in endoscopy, many groups propose a method using convolutional neural networks. In this paper, the ground truth of the depth image and the endoscopy image is generated through endoscopy simulation using the colon model segmented by CT colonography. Photo-realistic simulation images can be created using a sim-to-real approach using cycleGAN for endoscopy images. By training the generated dataset, we propose a quantitative endoscopy depth estimation network. The proposed method represents a better-evaluated score than the existing unsupervised training-based results.      
### 71.DAM-AL: Dilated Attention Mechanism with Attention Loss for 3D Infant Brain Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13559.pdf)
>  While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has played an essential role in infant brain analysis, segmenting MRI into a number of tissues such as gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial and complex due to the extremely low intensity contrast between tissues at around 6-9 months of age as well as amplified noise, myelination, and incomplete volume. In this paper, we tackle those limitations by developing a new deep learning model, named DAM-AL, which contains two main contributions, i.e., dilated attention mechanism and hard-case attention loss. Our DAM-AL network is designed with skip block layers and atrous block convolution. It contains both channel-wise attention at high-level context features and spatial attention at low-level spatial structural features. Our attention loss consists of two terms corresponding to region information and hard samples attention. Our proposed DAM-AL has been evaluated on the infant brain iSeg 2017 dataset and the experiments have been conducted on both validation and testing sets. We have benchmarked DAM-AL on Dice coefficient and ASD metrics and compared it with state-of-the-art methods.      
### 72.Classification of Histopathology Images of Lung Cancer Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13553.pdf)
>  Cancer is the uncontrollable cell division of abnormal cells inside the human body, which can spread to other body organs. It is one of the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and NCDs accounts for 71% of total deaths worldwide whereas lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer after female breast cancer. Cancer survival rate of lung cancer is only 19%. There are various methods for the diagnosis of lung cancer, such as X-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, bronchoscopy and biopsy. However, to know the subtype of lung cancer based on the tissue type H and E staining is widely used, where the staining is done on the tissue aspirated from a biopsy. Studies have reported that the type of histology is associated with prognosis and treatment in lung cancer. Therefore, early and accurate detection of lung cancer histology is an urgent need and as its treatment is dependent on the type of histology, molecular profile and stage of the disease, it is most essential to analyse the histopathology images of lung cancer. Hence, to speed up the vital process of diagnosis of lung cancer and reduce the burden on pathologists, Deep learning techniques are used. These techniques have shown improved efficacy in the analysis of histopathology slides of cancer. Several studies reported the importance of convolution neural networks (CNN) in the classification of histopathological pictures of various cancer types such as brain, skin, breast, lung, colorectal cancer. In this study tri-category classification of lung cancer images (normal, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) are carried out by using ResNet 50, VGG-19, Inception_ResNet_V2 and DenseNet for the feature extraction and triplet loss to guide the CNN such that it increases inter-cluster distance and reduces intra-cluster distance.      
### 73.MSHT: Multi-stage Hybrid Transformer for the ROSE Image Analysis of Pancreatic Cancer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13513.pdf)
>  Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant cancers in the world, which deteriorates rapidly with very high mortality. The rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) technique innovates the workflow by immediately analyzing the fast stained cytopathological images with on-site pathologists, which enables faster diagnosis in this time-pressured process. However, the wider expansion of ROSE diagnosis has been hindered by the lack of experienced pathologists. To overcome this problem, we propose a hybrid high-performance deep learning model to enable the automated workflow, thus freeing the occupation of the valuable time of pathologists. By firstly introducing the Transformer block into this field with our particular multi-stage hybrid design, the spatial features generated by the convolutional neural network (CNN) significantly enhance the Transformer global modeling. Turning multi-stage spatial features as global attention guidance, this design combines the robustness from the inductive bias of CNN with the sophisticated global modeling power of Transformer. A dataset of 4240 ROSE images is collected to evaluate the method in this unexplored field. The proposed multi-stage hybrid Transformer (MSHT) achieves 95.68% in classification accuracy, which is distinctively higher than the state-of-the-art models. Facing the need for interpretability, MSHT outperforms its counterparts with more accurate attention regions. The results demonstrate that the MSHT can distinguish cancer samples accurately at an unprecedented image scale, laying the foundation for deploying automatic decision systems and enabling the expansion of ROSE in clinical practice.

### 74.Sinogram upsampling using Primal-Dual UNet for undersampled CT and radial MRI reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13443.pdf)
>  CT and MRI are two widely used clinical imaging modalities for non-invasive diagnosis. However, both of these modalities come with certain problems. CT uses harmful ionising radiation, and MRI suffers from slow acquisition speed. Both problems can be tackled by undersampling, such as sparse sampling. However, such undersampled data leads to lower resolution and introduces artefacts. Several techniques, including deep learning based methods, have been proposed to reconstruct such data. However, the undersampled reconstruction problem for these two modalities was always considered as two different problems and tackled separately by different research works. This paper proposes a unified solution for both sparse CT and undersampled radial MRI reconstruction, achieved by applying Fourier transform-based pre-processing on the radial MRI and then reconstructing both modalities using sinogram upsampling combined with filtered back-projection. The Primal-Dual network is a deep learning based method for reconstructing sparsely-sampled CT data. This paper introduces Primal-Dual UNet, which improves the Primal-Dual network in terms of accuracy and reconstruction speed. The proposed method resulted in an average SSIM of 0.932 while performing sparse CT reconstruction for fan-beam geometry with a sparsity level of 16, achieving a statistically significant improvement over the previous model, which resulted in 0.919. Furthermore, the proposed model resulted in 0.903 and 0.957 average SSIM while reconstructing undersampled brain and abdominal MRI data with an acceleration factor of 16 - statistically significant improvements over the original model, which resulted in 0.867 and 0.949. Finally, this paper shows that the proposed network not only improves the overall image quality, but also improves the image quality for the regions-of-interest; as well as generalises better in presence of a needle.      
### 75.Delivery Issues Identification from Customer Feedback Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13372.pdf)
>  Millions of packages are delivered successfully by online and local retail stores across the world every day. The proper delivery of packages is needed to ensure high customer satisfaction and repeat purchases. These deliveries suffer various problems despite the best efforts from the stores. These issues happen not only due to the large volume and high demand for low turnaround time but also due to mechanical operations and natural factors. These issues range from receiving wrong items in the package to delayed shipment to damaged packages because of mishandling during transportation. Finding solutions to various delivery issues faced by both sending and receiving parties plays a vital role in increasing the efficiency of the entire process. This paper shows how to find these issues using customer feedback from the text comments and uploaded images. We used transfer learning for both Text and Image models to minimize the demand for thousands of labeled examples. The results show that the model can find different issues. Furthermore, it can also be used for tasks like bottleneck identification, process improvement, automating refunds, etc. Compared with the existing process, the ensemble of text and image models proposed in this paper ensures the identification of several types of delivery issues, which is more suitable for the real-life scenarios of delivery of items in retail businesses. This method can supply a new idea of issue detection for the delivery of packages in similar industries.      
### 76.Itô-Taylor Sampling Scheme for Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models using Ideal Derivatives  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13339.pdf)
>  Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have been attracting attention recently as a new challenger to popular deep neural generative models including GAN, VAE, etc. However, DDPMs have a disadvantage that they often require a huge number of refinement steps during the synthesis. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new DDPM sampler based on a second-order numerical scheme for stochastic differential equations (SDEs), while the conventional sampler is based on a first-order numerical scheme. In general, it is not easy to compute the derivatives that are required in higher-order numerical schemes. However, in the case of DDPM, this difficulty is alleviated by the trick which the authors call "ideal derivative substitution". The newly derived higher-order sampler was applied to both image and speech generation tasks, and it is experimentally observed that the proposed sampler could synthesize plausible images and audio signals in relatively smaller number of refinement steps.      
### 77.Learning Cross-Scale Prediction for Efficient Neural Video Compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13309.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present the first neural video codec that can compete with the latest coding standard H.266/VVC in terms of sRGB PSNR on UVG dataset for the low-latency mode. Existing neural hybrid video coding approaches rely on optical flow or Gaussian-scale flow for prediction, which cannot support fine-grained adaptation to diverse motion content. Towards more content-adaptive prediction, we propose a novel cross-scale prediction module that achieves more effective motion compensation. Specifically, on the one hand, we produce a reference feature pyramid as prediction sources, then transmit cross-scale flows that leverage the feature scale to control the precision of prediction. On the other hand, we introduce the mechanism of weighted prediction into the scenario of prediction with a single reference frame, where cross-scale weight maps are transmitted to synthesize a fine prediction result. In addition to the cross-scale prediction module, we further propose a multi-stage quantization strategy, which improves the rate-distortion performance with no extra computational penalty during inference. We show the encouraging performance of our efficient neural video codec (ENVC) on several common benchmark datasets and analyze in detail the effectiveness of every important component.      
### 78.Artifact Reduction in Fundus Imaging using Cycle Consistent Adversarial Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13264.pdf)
>  Fundus images are very useful in identifying various ophthalmic disorders. However, due to the presence of artifacts, the visibility of the retina is severely affected. This may result in misdiagnosis of the disorder which may lead to more complicated problems. Since deep learning is a powerful tool to extract patterns from data without much human intervention, they can be applied to image-to-image translation problems. An attempt has been made in this paper to automatically rectify such artifacts present in the images of the fundus. We use a CycleGAN based model which consists of residual blocks to reduce the artifacts in the images. Significant improvements are seen when compared to the existing techniques.      
### 79.Evolutionary Generation of Visual Motion Illusions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13243.pdf)
>  Why do we sometimes perceive static images as if they were moving? Visual motion illusions enjoy a sustained popularity, yet there is no definitive answer to the question of why they work. We present a generative model, the Evolutionary Illusion GENerator (EIGen), that creates new visual motion illusions. The structure of EIGen supports the hypothesis that illusory motion might be the result of perceiving the brain's own predictions rather than perceiving raw visual input from the eyes. The scientific motivation of this paper is to demonstrate that the perception of illusory motion could be a side effect of the predictive abilities of the brain. The philosophical motivation of this paper is to call attention to the untapped potential of "motivated failures", ways for artificial systems to fail as biological systems fail, as a worthy outlet for Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Life research.      
### 80.Pseudocylindrical Convolutions for Learned Omnidirectional Image Compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13227.pdf)
>  Although equirectangular projection (ERP) is a convenient form to store omnidirectional images (also known as 360-degree images), it is neither equal-area nor conformal, thus not friendly to subsequent visual communication. In the context of image compression, ERP will over-sample and deform things and stuff near the poles, making it difficult for perceptually optimal bit allocation. In conventional 360-degree image compression, techniques such as region-wise packing and tiled representation are introduced to alleviate the over-sampling problem, achieving limited success. In this paper, we make one of the first attempts to learn deep neural networks for omnidirectional image compression. We first describe parametric pseudocylindrical representation as a generalization of common pseudocylindrical map projections. A computationally tractable greedy method is presented to determine the (sub)-optimal configuration of the pseudocylindrical representation in terms of a novel proxy objective for rate-distortion performance. We then propose pseudocylindrical convolutions for 360-degree image compression. Under reasonable constraints on the parametric representation, the pseudocylindrical convolution can be efficiently implemented by standard convolution with the so-called pseudocylindrical padding. To demonstrate the feasibility of our idea, we implement an end-to-end 360-degree image compression system, consisting of the learned pseudocylindrical representation, an analysis transform, a non-uniform quantizer, a synthesis transform, and an entropy model. Experimental results on $19,790$ omnidirectional images show that our method achieves consistently better rate-distortion performance than the competing methods. Moreover, the visual quality by our method is significantly improved for all images at all bitrates.      
### 81.Network-Aware 5G Edge Computing for Object Detection: Augmenting Wearables to "See'' More, Farther and Faster  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13194.pdf)
>  Advanced wearable devices are increasingly incorporating high-resolution multi-camera systems. As state-of-the-art neural networks for processing the resulting image data are computationally demanding, there has been growing interest in leveraging fifth generation (5G) wireless connectivity and mobile edge computing for offloading this processing to the cloud. To assess this possibility, this paper presents a detailed simulation and evaluation of 5G wireless offloading for object detection within a powerful, new smart wearable called VIS4ION, for the Blind-and-Visually Impaired (BVI). The current VIS4ION system is an instrumented book-bag with high-resolution cameras, vision processing and haptic and audio feedback. The paper considers uploading the camera data to a mobile edge cloud to perform real-time object detection and transmitting the detection results back to the wearable. To determine the video requirements, the paper evaluates the impact of video bit rate and resolution on object detection accuracy and range. A new street scene dataset with labeled objects relevant to BVI navigation is leveraged for analysis. The vision evaluation is combined with a detailed full-stack wireless network simulation to determine the distribution of throughputs and delays with real navigation paths and ray-tracing from new high-resolution 3D models in an urban environment. For comparison, the wireless simulation considers both a standard 4G-Long Term Evolution (LTE) carrier and high-rate 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) carrier. The work thus provides a thorough and realistic assessment of edge computing with mmWave connectivity in an application with both high bandwidth and low latency requirements.      
### 82.DSRGAN: Detail Prior-Assisted Perceptual Single Image Super-Resolution via Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13191.pdf)
>  The generative adversarial network (GAN) is successfully applied to study the perceptual single image superresolution (SISR). However, the GAN often tends to generate images with high frequency details being inconsistent with the real ones. Inspired by conventional detail enhancement algorithms, we propose a novel prior knowledge, the detail prior, to assist the GAN in alleviating this problem and restoring more realistic details. The proposed method, named DSRGAN, includes a well designed detail extraction algorithm to capture the most important high frequency information from images. Then, two discriminators are utilized for supervision on image-domain and detail-domain restorations, respectively. The DSRGAN merges the restored detail into the final output via a detail enhancement manner. The special design of DSRGAN takes advantages from both the model-based conventional algorithm and the data-driven deep learning network. Experimental results demonstrate that the DSRGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art SISR methods on perceptual metrics and achieves comparable results in terms of fidelity metrics simultaneously. Following the DSRGAN, it is feasible to incorporate other conventional image processing algorithms into a deep learning network to form a model-based deep SISR.      
### 83.Fast 2D Convolutions and Cross-Correlations Using Scalable Architectures  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13150.pdf)
>  The manuscript describes fast and scalable architectures and associated algorithms for computing convolutions and cross-correlations. The basic idea is to map 2D convolutions and cross-correlations to a collection of 1D convolutions and cross-correlations in the transform domain. This is accomplished through the use of the Discrete Periodic Radon Transform (DPRT) for general kernels and the use of SVD-LU decompositions for low-rank kernels. The approach uses scalable architectures that can be fitted into modern FPGA and Zynq-SOC devices. Based on different types of available resources, for $P\times P$ blocks, 2D convolutions and cross-correlations can be computed in just $O(P)$ clock cycles up to $O(P^2)$ clock cycles. Thus, there is a trade-off between performance and required numbers and types of resources. We provide implementations of the proposed architectures using modern programmable devices (Virtex-7 and Zynq-SOC). Based on the amounts and types of required resources, we show that the proposed approaches significantly outperform current methods.      
### 84.Fast and Scalable Computation of the Forward and Inverse Discrete Periodic Radon Transform  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13149.pdf)
>  The Discrete Periodic Radon Transform (DPRT) has been extensively used in applications that involve image reconstructions from projections. This manuscript introduces a fast and scalable approach for computing the forward and inverse DPRT that is based on the use of: (i) a parallel array of fixed-point adder trees, (ii) circular shift registers to remove the need for accessing external memory components when selecting the input data for the adder trees, (iii) an image block-based approach to DPRT computation that can fit the proposed architecture to available resources, and (iv) fast transpositions that are computed in one or a few clock cycles that do not depend on the size of the input image. As a result, for an $N\times N$ image ($N$ prime), the proposed approach can compute up to $N^{2}$ additions per clock cycle. Compared to previous approaches, the scalable approach provides the fastest known implementations for different amounts of computational resources. For example, for a $251\times 251$ image, for approximately $25\%$ fewer flip-flops than required for a systolic implementation, we have that the scalable DPRT is computed 36 times faster. For the fastest case, we introduce optimized architectures that can compute the DPRT and its inverse in just $2N+\left\lceil \log_{2}N\right\rceil+1$ and $2N+3\left\lceil \log_{2}N\right\rceil+B+2$ cycles respectively, where $B$ is the number of bits used to represent each input pixel. On the other hand, the scalable DPRT approach requires more 1-bit additions than for the systolic implementation and provides a trade-off between speed and additional 1-bit additions. All of the proposed DPRT architectures were implemented in VHDL and validated using an FPGA implementation.      
### 85.Does MAML Only Work via Feature Re-use? A Data Centric Perspective  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13137.pdf)
>  Recent work has suggested that a good embedding is all we need to solve many few-shot learning benchmarks. Furthermore, other work has strongly suggested that Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) also works via this same method - by learning a good embedding. These observations highlight our lack of understanding of what meta-learning algorithms are doing and when they work. In this work, we provide empirical results that shed some light on how meta-learned MAML representations function. In particular, we identify three interesting properties: 1) In contrast to previous work, we show that it is possible to define a family of synthetic benchmarks that result in a low degree of feature re-use - suggesting that current few-shot learning benchmarks might not have the properties needed for the success of meta-learning algorithms; 2) meta-overfitting occurs when the number of classes (or concepts) are finite, and this issue disappears once the task has an unbounded number of concepts (e.g., online learning); 3) more adaptation at meta-test time with MAML does not necessarily result in a significant representation change or even an improvement in meta-test performance - even when training on our proposed synthetic benchmarks. Finally, we suggest that to understand meta-learning algorithms better, we must go beyond tracking only absolute performance and, in addition, formally quantify the degree of meta-learning and track both metrics together. Reporting results in future work this way will help us identify the sources of meta-overfitting more accurately and help us design more flexible meta-learning algorithms that learn beyond fixed feature re-use. Finally, we conjecture the core challenge of re-thinking meta-learning is in the design of few-shot learning data sets and benchmarks - rather than in the algorithms, as suggested by previous work.      
### 86.The Curse of Zero Task Diversity: On the Failure of Transfer Learning to Outperform MAML and their Empirical Equivalence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13121.pdf)
>  It has been recently observed that a transfer learning solution might be all we needed to solve many few-shot learning benchmarks. This raises important questions about when and how meta-learning algorithms should be deployed. In this paper, we make a first step in clarifying these questions by first formulating a computable metric for a few-shot learning benchmark that we hypothesize is predictive of whether meta-learning solutions will succeed or not. We name this metric the diversity coefficient of a few-shot learning benchmark. Using the diversity coefficient, we show that the MiniImagenet benchmark has zero diversity - according to twenty-four different ways to compute the diversity. We proceed to show that when making a fair comparison between MAML learned solutions to transfer learning, both have identical meta-test accuracy. This suggests that transfer learning fails to outperform MAML - contrary to what previous work suggests. Together, these two facts provide the first test of whether diversity correlates with meta-learning success and therefore show that a diversity coefficient of zero correlates with a high similarity between transfer learning and MAML learned solutions - especially at meta-test time. We therefore conjecture meta-learned solutions have the same meta-test performance as transfer learning when the diversity coefficient is zero.      
### 87.Ultrasound Speckle Suppression and Denoising using MRI-derived Normalizing Flow Priors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13110.pdf)
>  Ultrasonography offers an inexpensive, widely-accessible and compact medical imaging solution. However, compared to other imaging modalities such as CT and MRI, ultrasound images notoriously suffer from strong speckle noise, which originates from the random interference of sub-wavelength scattering. This deteriorates ultrasound image quality and makes interpretation challenging. We here propose a new unsupervised ultrasound speckle reduction and image denoising method based on maximum-a-posteriori estimation with deep generative priors that are learned from high-quality MRI images. To model the generative tissue reflectivity prior, we exploit normalizing flows, which in recent years have shown to be very powerful in modeling signal priors across a variety of applications. To facilitate generaliation, we factorize the prior and train our flow model on patches from the NYU fastMRI (fully-sampled) dataset. This prior is then used for inference in an iterative denoising scheme. We first validate the utility of our learned priors on noisy MRI data (no prior domain shift), and then turn to evaluating performance on both simulated and in-vivo ultrasound images from the PICMUS and CUBDL datasets. The results show that the method outperforms other (unsupervised) ultrasound denoising methods (NLM and OBNLM) both quantitatively and qualitatively.      
### 88.CatchBackdoor: Backdoor Testing by Critical Trojan Neural Path Identification via Differential Fuzzing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13064.pdf)
>  The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications has benefited from abundant pre-trained models. However, the backdoored pre-trained models can pose a significant trojan threat to the deployment of downstream DNNs. Existing DNN testing methods are mainly designed to find incorrect corner case behaviors in adversarial settings but fail to discover the backdoors crafted by strong trojan attacks. Observing the trojan network behaviors shows that they are not just reflected by a single compromised neuron as proposed by previous work but attributed to the critical neural paths in the activation intensity and frequency of multiple neurons. This work formulates the DNN backdoor testing and proposes the CatchBackdoor framework. Via differential fuzzing of critical neurons from a small number of benign examples, we identify the trojan paths and particularly the critical ones, and generate backdoor testing examples by simulating the critical neurons in the identified paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CatchBackdoor, with higher detection performance than existing methods. CatchBackdoor works better on detecting backdoors by stealthy blending and adaptive attacks, which existing methods fail to detect. Moreover, our experiments show that CatchBackdoor may reveal the potential backdoors of models in Model Zoo.      
### 89.Generalized Wasserstein Dice Loss, Test-time Augmentation, and Transformers for the BraTS 2021 challenge  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13054.pdf)
>  Brain tumor segmentation from multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities is a challenging task in medical image computation. The main challenges lie in the generalizability to a variety of scanners and imaging protocols. In this paper, we explore strategies to increase model robustness without increasing inference time. Towards this aim, we explore finding a robust ensemble from models trained using different losses, optimizers, and train-validation data split. Importantly, we explore the inclusion of a transformer in the bottleneck of the U-Net architecture. While we find transformer in the bottleneck performs slightly worse than the baseline U-Net in average, the generalized Wasserstein Dice loss consistently produces superior results. Further, we adopt an efficient test time augmentation strategy for faster and robust inference. Our final ensemble of seven 3D U-Nets with test-time augmentation produces an average dice score of 89.4% and an average Hausdorff 95% distance of 10.0 mm when evaluated on the BraTS 2021 testing dataset.

### 90.Doppler velocity-based algorithm for Clustering and Velocity Estimation of moving objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12984.pdf)
>  We propose a Doppler velocity-based cluster and velocity estimation algorithm based on the characteristics of FMCW LiDAR which achieves highly accurate, single-scan, and real-time motion state detection and velocity estimation. We prove the continuity of the Doppler velocity on the same object. Based on this principle, we achieve the distinction between moving objects and stationary background via region growing clustering algorithm. The obtained stationary background will be used to estimate the velocity of the FMCW LiDAR by the least-squares method. Then we estimate the velocity of the moving objects using the estimated LiDAR velocity and the Doppler velocity of moving objects obtained by clustering. To ensure real-time processing, we set the appropriate least-squares parameters. Meanwhile, to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, we create the FMCW LiDAR model on the autonomous driving simulation platform CARLA for spawning data. The results show that our algorithm can process at least a 4.5million points and estimate the velocity of 150 moving objects per second under the arithmetic power of the Ryzen 3600x CPU, with a motion state detection accuracy of over 99% and estimated velocity accuracy of 0.1 m/s.      
### 91.Faster Deep Ensemble Averaging for Quantification of DNA Damage from Comet Assay Images With Uncertainty Estimates  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12839.pdf)
>  Several neurodegenerative diseases involve the accumulation of cellular DNA damage. Comet assays are a popular way of estimating the extent of DNA damage. Current literature on the use of deep learning to quantify DNA damage presents an empirical approach to hyper-parameter optimization and does not include uncertainty estimates. Deep ensemble averaging is a standard approach to estimating uncertainty but it requires several iterations of network training, which makes it time-consuming. Here we present an approach to quantify the extent of DNA damage that combines deep learning with a rigorous and comprehensive method to optimize the hyper-parameters with the help of statistical tests. We also use an architecture that allows for a faster computation of deep ensemble averaging and performs statistical tests applicable to networks using transfer learning. We applied our approach to a comet assay dataset with more than 1300 images and achieved an $R^2$ of 0.84, where the output included the confidence interval for each prediction. The proposed architecture is an improvement over the current approaches since it speeds up the uncertainty estimation by 30X while being statistically more rigorous.      
### 92.Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Iterative Reconstruction of CT Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12810.pdf)
>  Computed tomography (CT) uses X-ray measurements taken from sensors around the body to generate tomographic images of the human body. Conventional reconstruction algorithms can be used if the X-ray data are adequately sampled and of high quality; however, concerns such as reducing dose to the patient, or geometric limitations on data acquisition, may result in low quality or incomplete data. Images reconstructed from these data using conventional methods are of poor quality, due to noise and other artifacts. The aim of this study is to train a single neural network to reconstruct high-quality CT images from noisy or incomplete CT scan data, including low-dose, sparse-view, and limited-angle scenarios. To accomplish this task, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN) as a signal prior, to be used in conjunction with the iterative simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) for CT data. The network includes a self-attention block to model long-range dependencies in the data. We compare our Self-Attention GAN for CT image reconstruction with several state-of-the-art approaches, including denoising cycle GAN, CIRCLE GAN, and a total variation superiorized algorithm. Our approach is shown to have comparable overall performance to CIRCLE GAN, while outperforming the other two approaches.
