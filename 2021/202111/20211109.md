### 1.Information-Theoretic Bias Assessment Of Learned Representations Of Pretrained Face Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04673.pdf)
>  As equality issues in the use of face recognition have garnered a lot of attention lately, greater efforts have been made to debiased deep learning models to improve fairness to minorities. However, there is still no clear definition nor sufficient analysis for bias assessment metrics. We propose an information-theoretic, independent bias assessment metric to identify degree of bias against protected demographic attributes from learned representations of pretrained facial recognition systems. Our metric differs from other methods that rely on classification accuracy or examine the differences between ground truth and predicted labels of protected attributes predicted using a shallow network. Also, we argue, theoretically and experimentally, that logits-level loss is not adequate to explain bias since predictors based on neural networks will always find correlations. Further, we present a synthetic dataset that mitigates the issue of insufficient samples in certain cohorts. Lastly, we establish a benchmark metric by presenting advantages in clear discrimination and small variation comparing with other metrics, and evaluate the performance of different debiased models with the proposed metric.      
### 2.Composition and Style Attributes Guided Image Aesthetic Assessment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04647.pdf)
>  The aesthetic quality of an image is defined as the measure or appreciation of the beauty of an image. Aesthetics is inherently a subjective property but there are certain factors that influence it such as, the semantic content of the image, the attributes describing the artistic aspect, the photographic setup used for the shot, etc. In this paper we propose a method for the automatic prediction of the aesthetics of an image that is based on the analysis of the semantic content, the artistic style and the composition of the image. The proposed network includes: a pre-trained network for semantic features extraction (the Backbone); a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) network that relies on the Backbone features for the prediction of image attributes (the AttributeNet); a self-adaptive Hypernetwork that exploits the attributes prior encoded into the embedding generated by the AttributeNet to predict the parameters of the target network dedicated to aesthetic estimation (the AestheticNet). Given an image, the proposed multi-network is able to predict: style and composition attributes, and aesthetic score distribution. Results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, while the ablation study gives a better understanding of the proposed network.      
### 3.Tensor-based Subspace Factorization for StyleGAN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04554.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose $\tau$GAN a tensor-based method for modeling the latent space of generative models. The objective is to identify semantic directions in latent space. To this end, we propose to fit a multilinear tensor model on a structured facial expression database, which is initially embedded into latent space. We validate our approach on StyleGAN trained on FFHQ using BU-3DFE as a structured facial expression database. We show how the parameters of the multilinear tensor model can be approximated by Alternating Least Squares. Further, we introduce a tacked style-separated tensor model, defined as an ensemble of style-specific models to integrate our approach with the extended latent space of StyleGAN. We show that taking the individual styles of the extended latent space into account leads to higher model flexibility and lower reconstruction error. Finally, we do several experiments comparing our approach to former work on both GANs and multilinear models. Concretely, we analyze the expression subspace and find that the expression trajectories meet at an apathetic face that is consistent with earlier work. We also show that by changing the pose of a person, the generated image from our approach is closer to the ground truth than results from two competing approaches.      
### 4.Self-Supervised Intrinsic Image Decomposition Network Considering Reflectance Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04506.pdf)
>  We propose a novel intrinsic image decomposition network considering reflectance consistency. Intrinsic image decomposition aims to decompose an image into illumination-invariant and illumination-variant components, referred to as ``reflectance'' and ``shading,'' respectively. Although there are three consistencies that the reflectance and shading should satisfy, most conventional work does not sufficiently account for consistency with respect to reflectance, owing to the use of a white-illuminant decomposition model and the lack of training images capturing the same objects under various illumination-brightness and -color conditions. For this reason, the three consistencies are considered in the proposed network by using a color-illuminant model and training the network with losses calculated from images taken under various illumination conditions. In addition, the proposed network can be trained in a self-supervised manner because various illumination conditions can easily be simulated. Experimental results show that our network can decompose images into reflectance and shading components.      
### 5.3D Siamese Voxel-to-BEV Tracker for Sparse Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04426.pdf)
>  3D object tracking in point clouds is still a challenging problem due to the sparsity of LiDAR points in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a Siamese voxel-to-BEV tracker, which can significantly improve the tracking performance in sparse 3D point clouds. Specifically, it consists of a Siamese shape-aware feature learning network and a voxel-to-BEV target localization network. The Siamese shape-aware feature learning network can capture 3D shape information of the object to learn the discriminative features of the object so that the potential target from the background in sparse point clouds can be identified. To this end, we first perform template feature embedding to embed the template's feature into the potential target and then generate a dense 3D shape to characterize the shape information of the potential target. For localizing the tracked target, the voxel-to-BEV target localization network regresses the target's 2D center and the $z$-axis center from the dense bird's eye view (BEV) feature map in an anchor-free manner. Concretely, we compress the voxelized point cloud along $z$-axis through max pooling to obtain a dense BEV feature map, where the regression of the 2D center and the $z$-axis center can be performed more effectively. Extensive evaluation on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets shows that our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.      
### 6.GROWL: Group Detection With Link Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04397.pdf)
>  Interaction group detection has been previously addressed with bottom-up approaches which relied on the position and orientation information of individuals. These approaches were primarily based on pairwise affinity matrices and were limited to static, third-person views. This problem can greatly benefit from a holistic approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) beyond pairwise relationships, due to the inherent spatial configuration that exists between individuals who form interaction groups. Our proposed method, GROup detection With Link prediction (GROWL), demonstrates the effectiveness of a GNN based approach. GROWL predicts the link between two individuals by generating a feature embedding based on their neighbourhood in the graph and determines whether they are connected with a shallow binary classification method such as Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs). We test our method against other state-of-the-art group detection approaches on both a third-person view dataset and a robocentric (i.e., egocentric) dataset. In addition, we propose a multimodal approach based on RGB and depth data to calculate a representation GROWL can utilise as input. Our results show that a GNN based approach can significantly improve accuracy across different camera views, i.e., third-person and egocentric views.      
### 7.Geometrically Adaptive Dictionary Attack on Face Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04371.pdf)
>  CNN-based face recognition models have brought remarkable performance improvement, but they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Recent studies have shown that adversaries can fool the models even if they can only access the models' hard-label output. However, since many queries are needed to find imperceptible adversarial noise, reducing the number of queries is crucial for these attacks. In this paper, we point out two limitations of existing decision-based black-box attacks. We observe that they waste queries for background noise optimization, and they do not take advantage of adversarial perturbations generated for other images. We exploit 3D face alignment to overcome these limitations and propose a general strategy for query-efficient black-box attacks on face recognition named Geometrically Adaptive Dictionary Attack (GADA). Our core idea is to create an adversarial perturbation in the UV texture map and project it onto the face in the image. It greatly improves query efficiency by limiting the perturbation search space to the facial area and effectively recycling previous perturbations. We apply the GADA strategy to two existing attack methods and show overwhelming performance improvement in the experiments on the LFW and CPLFW datasets. Furthermore, we also present a novel attack strategy that can circumvent query similarity-based stateful detection that identifies the process of query-based black-box attacks.      
### 8.Grassmannian learning mutual subspace method for image set recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04352.pdf)
>  This paper addresses the problem of object recognition given a set of images as input (e.g., multiple camera sources and video frames). Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based frameworks do not exploit these sets effectively, processing a pattern as observed, not capturing the underlying feature distribution as it does not consider the variance of images in the set. To address this issue, we propose the Grassmannian learning mutual subspace method (G-LMSM), a NN layer embedded on top of CNNs as a classifier, that can process image sets more effectively and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. The image set is represented by a low-dimensional input subspace; and this input subspace is matched with reference subspaces by a similarity of their canonical angles, an interpretable and easy to compute metric. The key idea of G-LMSM is that the reference subspaces are learned as points on the Grassmann manifold, optimized with Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. This learning is stable, efficient and theoretically well-grounded. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on hand shape recognition, face identification, and facial emotion recognition.      
### 9.Partial Attack Supervision and Regional Weighted Inference for Masked Face Presentation Attack Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04336.pdf)
>  Wearing a mask has proven to be one of the most effective ways to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. However, wearing a mask poses challenges for different face recognition tasks and raises concerns about the performance of masked face presentation detection (PAD). The main issues facing the mask face PAD are the wrongly classified bona fide masked faces and the wrongly classified partial attacks (covered by real masks). This work addresses these issues by proposing a method that considers partial attack labels to supervise the PAD model training, as well as regional weighted inference to further improve the PAD performance by varying the focus on different facial areas. Our proposed method is not directly linked to specific network architecture and thus can be directly incorporated into any common or custom-designed network. In our work, two neural networks (DeepPixBis and MixFaceNet) are selected as backbones. The experiments are demonstrated on the collaborative real mask attack (CRMA) database. Our proposed method outperforms established PAD methods in the CRMA database by reducing the mentioned shortcomings when facing masked faces. Moreover, we present a detailed step-wise ablation study pointing out the individual and joint benefits of the proposed concepts on the overall PAD performance.      
### 10.Enhancing Prototypical Few-Shot Learning by Leveraging the Local-Level Strategy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04331.pdf)
>  Aiming at recognizing the samples from novel categories with few reference samples, few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging problem. We found that the existing works often build their few-shot model based on the image-level feature by mixing all local-level features, which leads to the discriminative location bias and information loss in local details. To tackle the problem, this paper returns the perspective to the local-level feature and proposes a series of local-level strategies. Specifically, we present (a) a local-agnostic training strategy to avoid the discriminative location bias between the base and novel categories, (b) a novel local-level similarity measure to capture the accurate comparison between local-level features, and (c) a local-level knowledge transfer that can synthesize different knowledge transfers from the base category according to different location features. Extensive experiments justify that our proposed local-level strategies can significantly boost the performance and achieve 2.8%-7.2% improvements over the baseline across different benchmark datasets, which also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy.      
### 11.Towards Debiasing Temporal Sentence Grounding in Video  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04321.pdf)
>  The temporal sentence grounding in video (TSGV) task is to locate a temporal moment from an untrimmed video, to match a language query, i.e., a sentence. Without considering bias in moment annotations (e.g., start and end positions in a video), many models tend to capture statistical regularities of the moment annotations, and do not well learn cross-modal reasoning between video and language query. In this paper, we propose two debiasing strategies, data debiasing and model debiasing, to "force" a TSGV model to capture cross-modal interactions. Data debiasing performs data oversampling through video truncation to balance moment temporal distribution in train set. Model debiasing leverages video-only and query-only models to capture the distribution bias, and forces the model to learn cross-modal interactions. Using VSLNet as the base model, we evaluate impact of the two strategies on two datasets that contain out-of-distribution test instances. Results show that both strategies are effective in improving model generalization capability. Equipped with both debiasing strategies, VSLNet achieves best results on both datasets.      
### 12.SEGA: Semantic Guided Attention on Visual Prototype for Few-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04316.pdf)
>  Teaching machines to recognize a new category based on few training samples especially only one remains challenging owing to the incomprehensive understanding of the novel category caused by the lack of data. However, human can learn new classes quickly even given few samples since human can tell what discriminative features should be focused on about each category based on both the visual and semantic prior knowledge. To better utilize those prior knowledge, we propose the SEmantic Guided Attention (SEGA) mechanism where the semantic knowledge is used to guide the visual perception in a top-down manner about what visual features should be paid attention to when distinguishing a category from the others. As a result, the embedding of the novel class even with few samples can be more discriminative. Concretely, a feature extractor is trained to embed few images of each novel class into a visual prototype with the help of transferring visual prior knowledge from base classes. Then we learn a network that maps semantic knowledge to category-specific attention vectors which will be used to perform feature selection to enhance the visual prototypes. Extensive experiments on miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and CUB indicate that our semantic guided attention realizes anticipated function and outperforms state-of-the-art results.      
### 13.Residual-Guided Learning Representation for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04310.pdf)
>  Photometric consistency loss is one of the representative objective functions commonly used for self-supervised monocular depth estimation. However, this loss often causes unstable depth predictions in textureless or occluded regions due to incorrect guidance. Recent self-supervised learning approaches tackle this issue by utilizing feature representations explicitly learned from auto-encoders, expecting better discriminability than the input image. Despite the use of auto-encoded features, we observe that the method does not embed features as discriminative as auto-encoded features. In this paper, we propose residual guidance loss that enables the depth estimation network to embed the discriminative feature by transferring the discriminability of auto-encoded features. We conducted experiments on the KITTI benchmark and verified our method's superiority and orthogonality on other state-of-the-art methods.      
### 14.Deep Marching Tetrahedra: a Hybrid Representation for High-Resolution 3D Shape Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04276.pdf)
>  We introduce DMTet, a deep 3D conditional generative model that can synthesize high-resolution 3D shapes using simple user guides such as coarse voxels. It marries the merits of implicit and explicit 3D representations by leveraging a novel hybrid 3D representation. Compared to the current implicit approaches, which are trained to regress the signed distance values, DMTet directly optimizes for the reconstructed surface, which enables us to synthesize finer geometric details with fewer artifacts. Unlike deep 3D generative models that directly generate explicit representations such as meshes, our model can synthesize shapes with arbitrary topology. The core of DMTet includes a deformable tetrahedral grid that encodes a discretized signed distance function and a differentiable marching tetrahedra layer that converts the implicit signed distance representation to the explicit surface mesh representation. This combination allows joint optimization of the surface geometry and topology as well as generation of the hierarchy of subdivisions using reconstruction and adversarial losses defined explicitly on the surface mesh. Our approach significantly outperforms existing work on conditional shape synthesis from coarse voxel inputs, trained on a dataset of complex 3D animal shapes.

### 15.Generative Dynamic Patch Attack  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04266.pdf)
>  Adversarial patch attack is a family of attack algorithms that perturb a part of image to fool a deep neural network model. Existing patch attacks mostly consider injecting adversarial patches at input-agnostic locations: either a predefined location or a random location. This attack setup may be sufficient for attack but has considerable limitations when using it for adversarial training. Thus, robust models trained with existing patch attacks cannot effectively defend other adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first propose an end-to-end patch attack algorithm, Generative Dynamic Patch Attack (GDPA), which generates both patch pattern and patch location adversarially for each input image. We show that GDPA is a generic attack framework that can produce dynamic/static and visible/invisible patches with a few configuration changes. Secondly, GDPA can be readily integrated for adversarial training to improve model robustness to various adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on VGGFace, Traffic Sign and ImageNet show that GDPA achieves higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art patch attacks, while adversarially trained model with GDPA demonstrates superior robustness to adversarial patch attacks than competing methods.

### 16.Cross-Modal Object Tracking: Modality-Aware Representations and A Unified Benchmark  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04264.pdf)
>  In many visual systems, visual tracking often bases on RGB image sequences, in which some targets are invalid in low-light conditions, and tracking performance is thus affected significantly. Introducing other modalities such as depth and infrared data is an effective way to handle imaging limitations of individual sources, but multi-modal imaging platforms usually require elaborate designs and cannot be applied in many real-world applications at present. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging becomes an essential part of many surveillance cameras, whose imaging is switchable between RGB and NIR based on the light intensity. These two modalities are heterogeneous with very different visual properties and thus bring big challenges for visual tracking. However, existing works have not studied this challenging problem. In this work, we address the cross-modal object tracking problem and contribute a new video dataset, including 654 cross-modal image sequences with over 481K frames in total, and the average video length is more than 735 frames. To promote the research and development of cross-modal object tracking, we propose a new algorithm, which learns the modality-aware target representation to mitigate the appearance gap between RGB and NIR modalities in the tracking process. It is plug-and-play and could thus be flexibly embedded into different tracking frameworks. Extensive experiments on the dataset are conducted, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in two representative tracking frameworks against 17 state-of-the-art tracking methods. We will release the dataset for free academic usage, dataset download link and code will be released soon.      
### 17.Template NeRF: Towards Modeling Dense Shape Correspondences from Category-Specific Object Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04237.pdf)
>  We present neural radiance fields (NeRF) with templates, dubbed Template-NeRF, for modeling appearance and geometry and generating dense shape correspondences simultaneously among objects of the same category from only multi-view posed images, without the need of either 3D supervision or ground-truth correspondence knowledge. The learned dense correspondences can be readily used for various image-based tasks such as keypoint detection, part segmentation, and texture transfer that previously require specific model designs. Our method can also accommodate annotation transfer in a one or few-shot manner, given only one or a few instances of the category. Using periodic activation and feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioning, we introduce deep implicit templates on 3D data into the 3D-aware image synthesis pipeline NeRF. By representing object instances within the same category as shape and appearance variation of a shared NeRF template, our proposed method can achieve dense shape correspondences reasoning on images for a wide range of object classes. We demonstrate the results and applications on both synthetic and real-world data with competitive results compared with other methods based on 3D information.      
### 18.A Study of the Human Perception of Synthetic Faces  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04230.pdf)
>  Advances in face synthesis have raised alarms about the deceptive use of synthetic faces. Can synthetic identities be effectively used to fool human observers? In this paper, we introduce a study of the human perception of synthetic faces generated using different strategies including a state-of-the-art deep learning-based GAN model. This is the first rigorous study of the effectiveness of synthetic face generation techniques grounded in experimental techniques from psychology. We answer important questions such as how often do GAN-based and more traditional image processing-based techniques confuse human observers, and are there subtle cues within a synthetic face image that cause humans to perceive it as a fake without having to search for obvious clues? To answer these questions, we conducted a series of large-scale crowdsourced behavioral experiments with different sources of face imagery. Results show that humans are unable to distinguish synthetic faces from real faces under several different circumstances. This finding has serious implications for many different applications where face images are presented to human users.      
### 19.Practical, Fast and Robust Point Cloud Registration for 3D Scene Stitching and Object Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04228.pdf)
>  3D point cloud registration ranks among the most fundamental problems in remote sensing, photogrammetry, robotics and geometric computer vision. Due to the limited accuracy of 3D feature matching techniques, outliers may exist, sometimes even in very large numbers, among the correspondences. Since existing robust solvers may encounter high computational cost or restricted robustness, we propose a novel, fast and highly robust solution, named VOCRA (VOting with Cost function and Rotating Averaging), for the point cloud registration problem with extreme outlier rates. Our first contribution is to employ the Tukey's Biweight robust cost to introduce a new voting and correspondence sorting technique, which proves to be rather effective in distinguishing true inliers from outliers even with extreme (99%) outlier rates. Our second contribution consists in designing a time-efficient consensus maximization paradigm based on robust rotation averaging, serving to seek inlier candidates among the correspondences. Finally, we apply Graduated Non-Convexity with Tukey's Biweight (GNC-TB) to estimate the correct transformation with the inlier candidates obtained, which is then used to find the complete inlier set. Both standard benchmarking and realistic experiments with application to two real-data problems are conducted, and we show that our solver VOCRA is robust against over 99% outliers and more time-efficient than the state-of-the-art competitors.      
### 20.Rethinking Deconvolution for 2D Human Pose Estimation Light yet Accurate Model for Real-time Edge Computing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04226.pdf)
>  In this study, we present a pragmatic lightweight pose estimation model. Our model can achieve real-time predictions using low-power embedded devices. This system was found to be very accurate and achieved a 94.5% accuracy of SOTA HRNet 256x192 using a computational cost of only 3.8% on COCO test dataset. Our model adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and is carefully downsized to improve its efficiency. We especially focused on optimizing the deconvolution layers and observed that the channel reduction of the deconvolution layers contributes significantly to reducing computational resource consumption without degrading the accuracy of this system. We also incorporated recent model agnostic techniques such as DarkPose and distillation training to maximize the efficiency of our model. Furthermore, we applied model quantization to exploit multi/mixed precision features. Our FP16'ed model (COCO AP 70.0) operates at ~60-fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and ~200 fps on NVIDIA Quadro RTX6000.      
### 21.Natural Adversarial Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04204.pdf)
>  Although state-of-the-art object detection methods have shown compelling performance, models often are not robust to adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution data. We introduce a new dataset, Natural Adversarial Objects (NAO), to evaluate the robustness of object detection models. NAO contains 7,934 images and 9,943 objects that are unmodified and representative of real-world scenarios, but cause state-of-the-art detection models to misclassify with high confidence. The mean average precision (mAP) of EfficientDet-D7 drops 74.5% when evaluated on NAO compared to the standard MSCOCO validation set. <br>Moreover, by comparing a variety of object detection architectures, we find that better performance on MSCOCO validation set does not necessarily translate to better performance on NAO, suggesting that robustness cannot be simply achieved by training a more accurate model. <br>We further investigate why examples in NAO are difficult to detect and classify. Experiments of shuffling image patches reveal that models are overly sensitive to local texture. Additionally, using integrated gradients and background replacement, we find that the detection model is reliant on pixel information within the bounding box, and insensitive to the background context when predicting class labels. NAO can be downloaded at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15P8sOWoJku6SSEiHLEts86ORfytGezi8" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 22.Look at the Variance! Efficient Black-box Explanations with Sobol-based Sensitivity Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04138.pdf)
>  We describe a novel attribution method which is grounded in Sensitivity Analysis and uses Sobol indices. Beyond modeling the individual contributions of image regions, Sobol indices provide an efficient way to capture higher-order interactions between image regions and their contributions to a neural network's prediction through the lens of variance. We describe an approach that makes the computation of these indices efficient for high-dimensional problems by using perturbation masks coupled with efficient estimators to handle the high dimensionality of images. Importantly, we show that the proposed method leads to favorable scores on standard benchmarks for vision (and language models) while drastically reducing the computing time compared to other black-box methods -- even surpassing the accuracy of state-of-the-art white-box methods which require access to internal representations.

### 23.Global-Local Attention for Emotion Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04129.pdf)
>  Human emotion recognition is an active research area in artificial intelligence and has made substantial progress over the past few years. Many recent works mainly focus on facial regions to infer human affection, while the surrounding context information is not effectively utilized. In this paper, we proposed a new deep network to effectively recognize human emotions using a novel global-local attention mechanism. Our network is designed to extract features from both facial and context regions independently, then learn them together using the attention module. In this way, both the facial and contextual information is used to infer human emotions, therefore enhancing the discrimination of the classifier. The intensive experiments show that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods on recent emotion datasets by a fair margin. Qualitatively, our global-local attention module can extract more meaningful attention maps than previous methods. The source code and trained model of our network are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/minhnhatvt/glamor-net" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 24.NeurInt : Learning to Interpolate through Neural ODEs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04123.pdf)
>  A wide range of applications require learning image generation models whose latent space effectively captures the high-level factors of variation present in the data distribution. The extent to which a model represents such variations through its latent space can be judged by its ability to interpolate between images smoothly. However, most generative models mapping a fixed prior to the generated images lead to interpolation trajectories lacking smoothness and containing images of reduced quality. In this work, we propose a novel generative model that learns a flexible non-parametric prior over interpolation trajectories, conditioned on a pair of source and target images. Instead of relying on deterministic interpolation methods (such as linear or spherical interpolation in latent space), we devise a framework that learns a distribution of trajectories between two given images using Latent Second-Order Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. Through a hybrid combination of reconstruction and adversarial losses, the generator is trained to map the sampled points from these trajectories to sequences of realistic images that smoothly transition from the source to the target image. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in generating images of improved quality as well as its ability to learn a diverse distribution over smooth interpolation trajectories for any pair of real source and target images.      
### 25.Cross-modal Zero-shot Hashing by Label Attributes Embedding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04080.pdf)
>  Cross-modal hashing (CMH) is one of the most promising methods in cross-modal approximate nearest neighbor search. Most CMH solutions ideally assume the labels of training and testing set are identical. However, the assumption is often violated, causing a zero-shot CMH problem. Recent efforts to address this issue focus on transferring knowledge from the seen classes to the unseen ones using label attributes. However, the attributes are isolated from the features of multi-modal data. To reduce the information gap, we introduce an approach called LAEH (Label Attributes Embedding for zero-shot cross-modal Hashing). LAEH first gets the initial semantic attribute vectors of labels by word2vec model and then uses a transformation network to transform them into a common subspace. Next, it leverages the hash vectors and the feature similarity matrix to guide the feature extraction network of different modalities. At the same time, LAEH uses the attribute similarity as the supplement of label similarity to rectify the label embedding and common subspace. Experiments show that LAEH outperforms related representative zero-shot and cross-modal hashing methods.      
### 26.Direct Multi-view Multi-person 3D Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04076.pdf)
>  We present Multi-view Pose transformer (MvP) for estimating multi-person 3D poses from multi-view images. Instead of estimating 3D joint locations from costly volumetric representation or reconstructing the per-person 3D pose from multiple detected 2D poses as in previous methods, MvP directly regresses the multi-person 3D poses in a clean and efficient way, without relying on intermediate tasks. Specifically, MvP represents skeleton joints as learnable query embeddings and let them progressively attend to and reason over the multi-view information from the input images to directly regress the actual 3D joint locations. To improve the accuracy of such a simple pipeline, MvP presents a hierarchical scheme to concisely represent query embeddings of multi-person skeleton joints and introduces an input-dependent query adaptation approach. Further, MvP designs a novel geometrically guided attention mechanism, called projective attention, to more precisely fuse the cross-view information for each joint. MvP also introduces a RayConv operation to integrate the view-dependent camera geometry into the feature representations for augmenting the projective attention. We show experimentally that our MvP model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks while being much more efficient. Notably, it achieves 92.3% AP25 on the challenging Panoptic dataset, improving upon the previous best approach [36] by 9.8%.

### 27.Are we ready for a new paradigm shift? A Survey on Visual Deep MLP  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04060.pdf)
>  Multilayer perceptron (MLP), as the first neural network structure to appear, was a big hit. But constrained by the hardware computing power and the size of the datasets, it once sank for tens of years. During this period, we have witnessed a paradigm shift from manual feature extraction to the CNN with local receptive fields, and further to the Transform with global receptive fields based on self-attention mechanism. And this year (2021), with the introduction of MLP-Mixer, MLP has re-entered the limelight and has attracted extensive research from the computer vision community. Compare to the conventional MLP, it gets deeper but changes the input from full flattening to patch flattening. Given its high performance and less need for vision-specific inductive bias, the community can't help but wonder, Will MLP, the simplest structure with global receptive fields but no attention, become a new computer vision paradigm? To answer this question, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent development of vision deep MLP models. Specifically, we review these vision deep MLPs detailedly, from the subtle sub-module design to the global network structure. We compare the receptive field, computational complexity, and other properties of different network designs in order to have a clear understanding of the development path of MLPs. The investigation shows that MLPs' resolution-sensitivity and computational densities remain unresolved, and pure MLPs are gradually evolving towards CNN-like. We suggest that the current data volume and computational power are not ready to embrace pure MLPs, and artificial visual guidance remains important. Finally, we provide an analysis of open research directions and possible future works. We hope this effort will ignite further interest in the community and encourage better visual tailored design for the neural network at the moment.      
### 28.Registration Techniques for Deformable Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04053.pdf)
>  In general, the problem of non-rigid registration is about matching two different scans of a dynamic object taken at two different points in time. These scans can undergo both rigid motions and non-rigid deformations. Since new parts of the model may come into view and other parts get occluded in between two scans, the region of overlap is a subset of both scans. In the most general setting, no prior template shape is given and no markers or explicit feature point correspondences are available. So, this case is a partial matching problem that takes into account the assumption that consequent scans undergo small deformations while having a significant amount of overlapping area [28]. The problem which this thesis is addressing is mapping deforming objects and localizing cameras in the environment at the same time.      
### 29.Style Transfer with Target Feature Palette and Attention Coloring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04028.pdf)
>  Style transfer has attracted a lot of attentions, as it can change a given image into one with splendid artistic styles while preserving the image structure. However, conventional approaches easily lose image details and tend to produce unpleasant artifacts during style transfer. In this paper, to solve these problems, a novel artistic stylization method with target feature palettes is proposed, which can transfer key features accurately. Specifically, our method contains two modules, namely feature palette composition (FPC) and attention coloring (AC) modules. The FPC module captures representative features based on K-means clustering and produces a feature target palette. The following AC module calculates attention maps between content and style images, and transfers colors and patterns based on the attention map and the target palette. These modules enable the proposed stylization to focus on key features and generate plausibly transferred images. Thus, the contributions of the proposed method are to propose a novel deep learning-based style transfer method and present target feature palette and attention coloring modules, and provide in-depth analysis and insight on the proposed method via exhaustive ablation study. Qualitative and quantitative results show that our stylized images exhibit state-of-the-art performance, with strength in preserving core structures and details of the content image.      
### 30.SL-CycleGAN: Blind Motion Deblurring in Cycles using Sparse Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04026.pdf)
>  In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end generative adversarial network (GAN) based on sparse learning for single image blind motion deblurring, which we called SL-CycleGAN. For the first time in blind motion deblurring, we propose a sparse ResNet-block as a combination of sparse convolution layers and a trainable spatial pooler k-winner based on HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) to replace non-linearity such as ReLU in the ResNet-block of SL-CycleGAN generators. Furthermore, unlike many state-of-the-art GAN-based motion deblurring methods that treat motion deblurring as a linear end-to-end process, we take our inspiration from the domain-to-domain translation ability of CycleGAN, and we show that image deblurring can be cycle-consistent while achieving the best qualitative results. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on popular image benchmarks both qualitatively and quantitatively and achieve the record-breaking PSNR of 38.087 dB on GoPro dataset, which is 5.377 dB better than the most recent deblurring method.      
### 31.Out-of-Domain Human Mesh Reconstruction via Dynamic Bilevel Online Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04017.pdf)
>  We consider a new problem of adapting a human mesh reconstruction model to out-of-domain streaming videos, where performance of existing SMPL-based models are significantly affected by the distribution shift represented by different camera parameters, bone lengths, backgrounds, and occlusions. We tackle this problem through online adaptation, gradually correcting the model bias during testing. There are two main challenges: First, the lack of 3D annotations increases the training difficulty and results in 3D ambiguities. Second, non-stationary data distribution makes it difficult to strike a balance between fitting regular frames and hard samples with severe occlusions or dramatic changes. To this end, we propose the Dynamic Bilevel Online Adaptation algorithm (DynaBOA). It first introduces the temporal constraints to compensate for the unavailable 3D annotations, and leverages a bilevel optimization procedure to address the conflicts between multi-objectives. DynaBOA provides additional 3D guidance by co-training with similar source examples retrieved efficiently despite the distribution shift. Furthermore, it can adaptively adjust the number of optimization steps on individual frames to fully fit hard samples and avoid overfitting regular frames. DynaBOA achieves state-of-the-art results on three out-of-domain human mesh reconstruction benchmarks.      
### 32.A-PixelHop: A Green, Robust and Explainable Fake-Image Detector  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04012.pdf)
>  A novel method for detecting CNN-generated images, called Attentive PixelHop (or A-PixelHop), is proposed in this work. It has three advantages: 1) low computational complexity and a small model size, 2) high detection performance against a wide range of generative models, and 3) mathematical transparency. A-PixelHop is designed under the assumption that it is difficult to synthesize high-quality, high-frequency components in local regions. It contains four building modules: 1) selecting edge/texture blocks that contain significant high-frequency components, 2) applying multiple filter banks to them to obtain rich sets of spatial-spectral responses as features, 3) feeding features to multiple binary classifiers to obtain a set of soft decisions, 4) developing an effective ensemble scheme to fuse the soft decisions into the final decision. Experimental results show that A-PixelHop outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting CycleGAN-generated images. Furthermore, it can generalize well to unseen generative models and datasets.      
### 33.Multi-Scale Semantics-Guided Neural Networks for Efficient Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03993.pdf)
>  Skeleton data is of low dimension. However, there is a trend of using very deep and complicated feedforward neural networks to model the skeleton sequence without considering the complexity in recent year. In this paper, a simple yet effective multi-scale semantics-guided neural network (MS-SGN) is proposed for skeleton-based action recognition. We explicitly introduce the high level semantics of joints (joint type and frame index) into the network to enhance the feature representation capability of joints. Moreover, a multi-scale strategy is proposed to be robust to the temporal scale variations. In addition, we exploit the relationship of joints hierarchically through two modules, i.e., a joint-level module for modeling the correlations of joints in the same frame and a frame-level module for modeling the temporal dependencies of frames. With an order of magnitude smaller model size than most previous methods, MSSGN achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the NTU60, NTU120, and SYSU datasets.      
### 34.CALText: Contextual Attention Localization for Offline Handwritten Text  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03952.pdf)
>  Recognition of Arabic-like scripts such as Persian and Urdu is more challenging than Latin-based scripts. This is due to the presence of a two-dimensional structure, context-dependent character shapes, spaces and overlaps, and placement of diacritics. Not much research exists for offline handwritten Urdu script which is the 10th most spoken language in the world. We present an attention based encoder-decoder model that learns to read Urdu in context. A novel localization penalty is introduced to encourage the model to attend only one location at a time when recognizing the next character. In addition, we comprehensively refine the only complete and publicly available handwritten Urdu dataset in terms of ground-truth annotations. We evaluate the model on both Urdu and Arabic datasets and show that contextual attention localization outperforms both simple attention and multi-directional LSTM models.      
### 35.Convolutional Gated MLP: Combining Convolutions &amp; gMLP  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03940.pdf)
>  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to introduce Convolutions to Gated MultiLayer Perceptron and contributes an implementation of this novel Deep Learning architecture. Google Brain introduced the gMLP in May 2021. Microsoft introduced Convolutions in Vision Transformer in Mar 2021. Inspired by both gMLP and CvT, we introduce convolutional layers in gMLP. CvT combined the power of Convolutions and Attention. Our implementation combines the best of Convolutional learning along with spatial gated MLP. Further, the paper visualizes how CgMLP learns. Visualizations show how CgMLP learns from features such as outline of a car. While Attention was the basis of much of recent progress in Deep Learning, gMLP proposed an approach that doesn't use Attention computation. In Transformer based approaches, a whole lot of Attention matrixes need to be learnt using vast amount of training data. In gMLP, the fine tunning for new tasks can be challenging by transfer learning with smaller datasets. We implement CgMLP and compares it with gMLP on CIFAR dataset. Experimental results explore the power of generaliza-tion of CgMLP, while gMLP tend to drastically overfit the training data. <br>To summarize, the paper contributes a novel Deep Learning architecture and demonstrates the learning mechanism of CgMLP through visualizations, for the first time in literature.      
### 36.Tip-Adapter: Training-free CLIP-Adapter for Better Vision-Language Modeling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03930.pdf)
>  Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training, known as CLIP, has provided a new paradigm for learning visual representations by using large-scale contrastive image-text pairs. It shows impressive performance on zero-shot knowledge transfer to downstream tasks. To further enhance CLIP's few-shot capability, CLIP-Adapter proposed to fine-tune a lightweight residual feature adapter and significantly improves the performance for few-shot classification. However, such a process still needs extra training and computational resources. In this paper, we propose \textbf{T}raining-Free CL\textbf{IP}-\textbf{Adapter} (\textbf{Tip-Adapter}), which not only inherits CLIP's training-free advantage but also performs comparably or even better than CLIP-Adapter. Tip-Adapter does not require any back propagation for training the adapter, but creates the weights by a key-value cache model constructed from the few-shot training set. In this non-parametric manner, Tip-Adapter acquires well-performed adapter weights without any training, which is both efficient and effective. Moreover, the performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted by fine-tuning such properly initialized adapter for only a few epochs with super-fast convergence speed. We conduct extensive experiments of few-shot classification on ImageNet and other 10 datasets to demonstrate the superiority of proposed Tip-Adapter. The code will be released at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/Tip-Adapter" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 37.Domain Attention Consistency for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03911.pdf)
>  Most existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods minimize the distance between multiple source-target domain pairs via feature distribution alignment, an approach borrowed from the single source setting. However, with diverse source domains, aligning pairwise feature distributions is challenging and could even be counter-productive for MSDA. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach: transferable attribute learning. The motivation is simple: although different domains can have drastically different visual appearances, they contain the same set of classes characterized by the same set of attributes; an MSDA model thus should focus on learning the most transferable attributes for the target domain. Adopting this approach, we propose a domain attention consistency network, dubbed DAC-Net. The key design is a feature channel attention module, which aims to identify transferable features (attributes). Importantly, the attention module is supervised by a consistency loss, which is imposed on the distributions of channel attention weights between source and target domains. Moreover, to facilitate discriminative feature learning on the target data, we combine pseudo-labeling with a class compactness loss to minimize the distance between the target features and the classifier's weight vectors. Extensive experiments on three MSDA benchmarks show that our DAC-Net achieves new state of the art performance on all of them.      
### 38.Action Recognition using Transfer Learning and Majority Voting for CSGO  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03882.pdf)
>  Presently online video games have become a progressively favorite source of recreation and Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) is one of the top-listed online first-person shooting games. Numerous competitive games are arranged every year by Esports. Nonetheless, (i) No study has been conducted on video analysis and action recognition of CS: GO game-play which can play a substantial role in the gaming industry for prediction model (ii) No work has been done on the real-time application on the actions and results of a CS: GO match (iii) Game data of a match is usually available in the HLTV as a CSV formatted file however it does not have open access and HLTV tends to prevent users from taking data. This manuscript aims to develop a model for accurate prediction of 4 different actions and compare the performance among the five different transfer learning models with our self-developed deep neural network and identify the best-fitted model and also including major voting later on, which is qualified to provide real time prediction and the result of this model aids to the construction of the automated system of gathering and processing more data alongside solving the issue of collecting data from HLTV.      
### 39.Towards Calibrated Model for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition from Prior Perspective  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03874.pdf)
>  Real-world data universally confronts a severe class-imbalance problem and exhibits a long-tailed distribution, i.e., most labels are associated with limited instances. The naïve models supervised by such datasets would prefer dominant labels, encounter a serious generalization challenge and become poorly calibrated. We propose two novel methods from the prior perspective to alleviate this dilemma. First, we deduce a balance-oriented data augmentation named Uniform Mixup (UniMix) to promote mixup in long-tailed scenarios, which adopts advanced mixing factor and sampler in favor of the minority. Second, motivated by the Bayesian theory, we figure out the Bayes Bias (Bayias), an inherent bias caused by the inconsistency of prior, and compensate it as a modification on standard cross-entropy loss. We further prove that both the proposed methods ensure the classification calibration theoretically and empirically. Extensive experiments verify that our strategies contribute to a better-calibrated model, and their combination achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.      
### 40.What augmentations are sensitive to hyper-parameters and why?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03861.pdf)
>  We apply augmentations to our dataset to enhance the quality of our predictions and make our final models more resilient to noisy data and domain drifts. Yet the question remains, how are these augmentations going to perform with different hyper-parameters? In this study we evaluate the sensitivity of augmentations with regards to the model's hyper parameters along with their consistency and influence by performing a Local Surrogate (LIME) interpretation on the impact of hyper-parameters when different augmentations are applied to a machine learning model. We have utilized Linear regression coefficients for weighing each augmentation. Our research has proved that there are some augmentations which are highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and others which are more resilient and reliable.      
### 41.Multi-modal land cover mapping of remote sensing images using pyramid attention and gated fusion networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03845.pdf)
>  Multi-modality data is becoming readily available in remote sensing (RS) and can provide complementary information about the Earth's surface. Effective fusion of multi-modal information is thus important for various applications in RS, but also very challenging due to large domain differences, noise, and redundancies. There is a lack of effective and scalable fusion techniques for bridging multiple modality encoders and fully exploiting complementary information. To this end, we propose a new multi-modality network (MultiModNet) for land cover mapping of multi-modal remote sensing data based on a novel pyramid attention fusion (PAF) module and a gated fusion unit (GFU). The PAF module is designed to efficiently obtain rich fine-grained contextual representations from each modality with a built-in cross-level and cross-view attention fusion mechanism, and the GFU module utilizes a novel gating mechanism for early merging of features, thereby diminishing hidden redundancies and noise. This enables supplementary modalities to effectively extract the most valuable and complementary information for late feature fusion. Extensive experiments on two representative RS benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and superiority of the MultiModNet for multi-modal land cover classification.      
### 42.Neural Implicit Event Generator for Motion Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03824.pdf)
>  We present a novel framework of motion tracking from event data using implicit expression. Our framework use pre-trained event generation MLP named implicit event generator (IEG) and does motion tracking by updating its state (position and velocity) based on the difference between the observed event and generated event from the current state estimate. The difference is computed implicitly by the IEG. Unlike the conventional explicit approach, which requires dense computation to evaluate the difference, our implicit approach realizes efficient state update directly from sparse event data. Our sparse algorithm is especially suitable for mobile robotics applications where computational resources and battery life are limited. To verify the effectiveness of our method on real-world data, we applied it to the AR marker tracking application. We have confirmed that our framework works well in real-world environments in the presence of noise and background clutter.      
### 43.ROFT: Real-Time Optical Flow-Aided 6D Object Pose and Velocity Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03821.pdf)
>  6D object pose tracking has been extensively studied in the robotics and computer vision communities. The most promising solutions, leveraging on deep neural networks and/or filtering and optimization, exhibit notable performance on standard benchmarks. However, to our best knowledge, these have not been tested thoroughly against fast object motions. Tracking performance in this scenario degrades significantly, especially for methods that do not achieve real-time performance and introduce non negligible delays. In this work, we introduce ROFT, a Kalman filtering approach for 6D object pose and velocity tracking from a stream of RGB-D images. By leveraging real-time optical flow, ROFT synchronizes delayed outputs of low frame rate Convolutional Neural Networks for instance segmentation and 6D object pose estimation with the RGB-D input stream to achieve fast and precise 6D object pose and velocity tracking. We test our method on a newly introduced photorealistic dataset, Fast-YCB, which comprises fast moving objects from the YCB model set, and on the dataset for object and hand pose estimation HO-3D. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for 6D object pose tracking, while also providing 6D object velocity tracking. A video showing the experiments is provided as supplementary material.      
### 44.Will You Ever Become Popular? Learning to Predict Virality of Dance Clips  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03819.pdf)
>  Dance challenges are going viral in video communities like TikTok nowadays. Once a challenge becomes popular, thousands of short-form videos will be uploaded in merely a couple of days. Therefore, virality prediction from dance challenges is of great commercial value and has a wide range of applications, such as smart recommendation and popularity promotion. In this paper, a novel multi-modal framework which integrates skeletal, holistic appearance, facial and scenic cues is proposed for comprehensive dance virality prediction. To model body movements, we propose a pyramidal skeleton graph convolutional network (PSGCN) which hierarchically refines spatio-temporal skeleton graphs. Meanwhile, we introduce a relational temporal convolutional network (RTCN) to exploit appearance dynamics with non-local temporal relations. An attentive fusion approach is finally proposed to adaptively aggregate predictions from different modalities. To validate our method, we introduce a large-scale viral dance video (VDV) dataset, which contains over 4,000 dance clips of eight viral dance challenges. Extensive experiments on the VDV dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our model. Extensive experiments on the VDV dataset well demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we show that short video applications like multi-dimensional recommendation and action feedback can be derived from our model.      
### 45.Generation of microbial colonies dataset with deep learning style transfer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03789.pdf)
>  We introduce an effective strategy to generate a synthetic dataset of microbiological images of Petri dishes that can be used to train deep learning models. The developed generator employs traditional computer vision algorithms together with a neural style transfer method for data augmentation. We show that the method is able to synthesize a dataset of realistic looking images that can be used to train a neural network model capable of localising, segmenting, and classifying five different microbial species. Our method requires significantly fewer resources to obtain a useful dataset than collecting and labeling a whole large set of real images with annotations. We show that starting with only 100 real images, we can generate data to train a detector that achieves comparable results to the same detector but trained on a real, several dozen times bigger dataset. We prove the usefulness of the method in microbe detection and segmentation, but we expect that it is general and flexible and can also be applicable in other domains of science and industry to detect various objects.      
### 46.Disaster mapping from satellites: damage detection with crowdsourced point labels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03693.pdf)
>  High-resolution satellite imagery available immediately after disaster events is crucial for response planning as it facilitates broad situational awareness of critical infrastructure status such as building damage, flooding, and obstructions to access routes. Damage mapping at this scale would require hundreds of expert person-hours. However, a combination of crowdsourcing and recent advances in deep learning reduces the effort needed to just a few hours in real time. Asking volunteers to place point marks, as opposed to shapes of actual damaged areas, significantly decreases the required analysis time for response during the disaster. However, different volunteers may be inconsistent in their marking. This work presents methods for aggregating potentially inconsistent damage marks to train a neural network damage detector.      
### 47.The Role of Pre-Training in High-Resolution Remote Sensing Scene Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03690.pdf)
>  Due to the scarcity of labeled data, using models pre-trained on ImageNet is a de facto standard in remote sensing scene classification. Although, recently, several larger high resolution remote sensing (HRRS) datasets have appeared with a goal of establishing new benchmarks, attempts at training models from scratch on these datasets are sporadic. In this paper, we show that training models from scratch on several newer datasets yields comparable results to fine-tuning the models pre-trained on ImageNet. Furthermore, the representations learned on HRRS datasets transfer to other HRRS scene classification tasks better or at least similarly as those learned on ImageNet. Finally, we show that in many cases the best representations are obtained by using a second round of pre-training using in-domain data, i.e. domain-adaptive pre-training. The source code and pre-trained models are available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/risojevicv/RSSC-transfer" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.}      
### 48.SustainBench: Benchmarks for Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Machine Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04724.pdf)
>  Progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been hindered by a lack of data on key environmental and socioeconomic indicators, which historically have come from ground surveys with sparse temporal and spatial coverage. Recent advances in machine learning have made it possible to utilize abundant, frequently-updated, and globally available data, such as from satellites or social media, to provide insights into progress toward SDGs. Despite promising early results, approaches to using such data for SDG measurement thus far have largely evaluated on different datasets or used inconsistent evaluation metrics, making it hard to understand whether performance is improving and where additional research would be most fruitful. Furthermore, processing satellite and ground survey data requires domain knowledge that many in the machine learning community lack. In this paper, we introduce SustainBench, a collection of 15 benchmark tasks across 7 SDGs, including tasks related to economic development, agriculture, health, education, water and sanitation, climate action, and life on land. Datasets for 11 of the 15 tasks are released publicly for the first time. Our goals for SustainBench are to (1) lower the barriers to entry for the machine learning community to contribute to measuring and achieving the SDGs; (2) provide standard benchmarks for evaluating machine learning models on tasks across a variety of SDGs; and (3) encourage the development of novel machine learning methods where improved model performance facilitates progress towards the SDGs.      
### 49.OMD: Orthogonal Malware Detection Using Audio, Image, and Static Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04710.pdf)
>  With the growing number of malware and cyber attacks, there is a need for "orthogonal" cyber defense approaches, which are complementary to existing methods by detecting unique malware samples that are not predicted by other methods. In this paper, we propose a novel and orthogonal malware detection (OMD) approach to identify malware using a combination of audio descriptors, image similarity descriptors and other static/statistical features. First, we show how audio descriptors are effective in classifying malware families when the malware binaries are represented as audio signals. Then, we show that the predictions made on the audio descriptors are orthogonal to the predictions made on image similarity descriptors and other static features. Further, we develop a framework for error analysis and a metric to quantify how orthogonal a new feature set (or type) is with respect to other feature sets. This allows us to add new features and detection methods to our overall framework. Experimental results on malware datasets show that our approach provides a robust framework for orthogonal malware detection.      
### 50.Automated pharyngeal phase detection and bolus localization in videofluoroscopic swallowing study: Killing two birds with one stone?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04699.pdf)
>  The videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) is a gold-standard imaging technique for assessing swallowing, but analysis and rating of VFSS recordings is time consuming and requires specialized training and expertise. Researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to automatically detect the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and to localize the bolus in VFSS recordings via computer vision approaches, fostering the development of novel techniques for automatic VFSS analysis. However, training of algorithms to perform these tasks requires large amounts of annotated data that are seldom available. We demonstrate that the challenges of pharyngeal phase detection and bolus localization can be solved together using a single approach. We propose a deep-learning framework that jointly tackles pharyngeal phase detection and bolus localization in a weakly-supervised manner, requiring only the initial and final frames of the pharyngeal phase as ground truth annotations for the training. Our approach stems from the observation that bolus presence in the pharynx is the most prominent visual feature upon which to infer whether individual VFSS frames belong to the pharyngeal phase. We conducted extensive experiments with multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a dataset of 1245 VFSS clips from 59 healthy subjects. We demonstrated that the pharyngeal phase can be detected with an F1-score higher than 0.9. Moreover, by processing the class activation maps of the CNNs, we were able to localize the bolus with promising results, obtaining correlations with ground truth trajectories higher than 0.9, without any manual annotations of bolus location used for training purposes. Once validated on a larger sample of participants with swallowing disorders, our framework will pave the way for the development of intelligent tools for VFSS analysis to support clinicians in swallowing assessment.      
### 51.SMU: smooth activation function for deep networks using smoothing maximum technique  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04682.pdf)
>  Deep learning researchers have a keen interest in proposing two new novel activation functions which can boost network performance. A good choice of activation function can have significant consequences in improving network performance. A handcrafted activation is the most common choice in neural network models. ReLU is the most common choice in the deep learning community due to its simplicity though ReLU has some serious drawbacks. In this paper, we have proposed a new novel activation function based on approximation of known activation functions like Leaky ReLU, and we call this function Smooth Maximum Unit (SMU). Replacing ReLU by SMU, we have got 6.22% improvement in the CIFAR100 dataset with the ShuffleNet V2 model.      
### 52.Approximate Neural Architecture Search via Operation Distribution Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04670.pdf)
>  The standard paradigm in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is to search for a fully deterministic architecture with specific operations and connections. In this work, we instead propose to search for the optimal operation distribution, thus providing a stochastic and approximate solution, which can be used to sample architectures of arbitrary length. We propose and show, that given an architectural cell, its performance largely depends on the ratio of used operations, rather than any specific connection pattern in typical search spaces; that is, small changes in the ordering of the operations are often irrelevant. This intuition is orthogonal to any specific search strategy and can be applied to a diverse set of NAS algorithms. Through extensive validation on 4 data-sets and 4 NAS techniques (Bayesian optimisation, differentiable search, local search and random search), we show that the operation distribution (1) holds enough discriminating power to reliably identify a solution and (2) is significantly easier to optimise than traditional encodings, leading to large speed-ups at little to no cost in performance. Indeed, this simple intuition significantly reduces the cost of current approaches and potentially enable NAS to be used in a broader range of applications.      
### 53.S3RP: Self-Supervised Super-Resolution and Prediction for Advection-Diffusion Process  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04639.pdf)
>  We present a super-resolution model for an advection-diffusion process with limited information. While most of the super-resolution models assume high-resolution (HR) ground-truth data in the training, in many cases such HR dataset is not readily accessible. Here, we show that a Recurrent Convolutional Network trained with physics-based regularizations is able to reconstruct the HR information without having the HR ground-truth data. Moreover, considering the ill-posed nature of a super-resolution problem, we employ the Recurrent Wasserstein Autoencoder to model the uncertainty.      
### 54.DeepSteal: Advanced Model Extractions Leveraging Efficient Weight Stealing in Memories  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04625.pdf)
>  Recent advancements of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have seen widespread deployment in multiple security-sensitive domains. The need of resource-intensive training and use of valuable domain-specific training data have made these models a top intellectual property (IP) for model owners. One of the major threats to the DNN privacy is model extraction attacks where adversaries attempt to steal sensitive information in DNN models. Recent studies show hardware-based side channel attacks can reveal internal knowledge about DNN models (e.g., model architectures) However, to date, existing attacks cannot extract detailed model parameters (e.g., weights/biases). In this work, for the first time, we propose an advanced model extraction attack framework DeepSteal that effectively steals DNN weights with the aid of memory side-channel attack. Our proposed DeepSteal comprises two key stages. Firstly, we develop a new weight bit information extraction method, called HammerLeak, through adopting the rowhammer based hardware fault technique as the information leakage vector. HammerLeak leverages several novel system-level techniques tailed for DNN applications to enable fast and efficient weight stealing. Secondly, we propose a novel substitute model training algorithm with Mean Clustering weight penalty, which leverages the partial leaked bit information effectively and generates a substitute prototype of the target victim model. We evaluate this substitute model extraction method on three popular image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100/GTSRB) and four DNN architectures (e.g., ResNet-18/34/Wide-ResNet/VGG-11). The extracted substitute model has successfully achieved more than 90 % test accuracy on deep residual networks for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, our extracted substitute model could also generate effective adversarial input samples to fool the victim model.      
### 55.Machine Learning Guided 3D Image Recognition for Carbonate Pore and Mineral Volumes Determination  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04612.pdf)
>  Automated image processing algorithms can improve the quality, efficiency, and consistency of classifying the morphology of heterogeneous carbonate rock and can deal with a massive amount of data and images seamlessly. Geoscientists face difficulties in setting the direction of the optimum method for determining petrophysical properties from rock images, Micro-Computed Tomography (uCT), or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Most of the successful work is from the homogeneous rocks focusing on 2D images with less focus on 3D and requiring numerical simulation. Currently, image analysis methods converge to three approaches: image processing, artificial intelligence, and combined image processing with artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose two methods to determine the porosity from 3D uCT and MRI images: an image processing method with Image Resolution Optimized Gaussian Algorithm (IROGA); advanced image recognition method enabled by Machine Learning Difference of Gaussian Random Forest (MLDGRF). We have built reference 3D micro models and collected images for calibration of IROGA and MLDGRF methods. To evaluate the predictive capability of these calibrated approaches, we ran them on 3D uCT and MRI images of natural heterogeneous carbonate rock. We measured the porosity and lithology of the carbonate rock using three and two industry-standard ways, respectively, as reference values. Notably, IROGA and MLDGRF have produced porosity results with an accuracy of 96.2% and 97.1% on the training set and 91.7% and 94.4% on blind test validation, respectively, in comparison with the three experimental measurements. We measured limestone and pyrite reference values using two methods, X-ray powder diffraction, and grain density measurements. MLDGRF has produced lithology (limestone and Pyrite) volumes with 97.7% accuracy.      
### 56.Improved Regularization and Robustness for Fine-tuning in Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04578.pdf)
>  A widely used algorithm for transfer learning is fine-tuning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a target task with a small amount of labeled data. When the capacity of the pre-trained model is much larger than the size of the target data set, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and "memorizing" the training labels. Hence, an important question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness to noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling -- the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of image and text data sets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task. When the target data set includes noisy labels, our approach outperforms baseline methods by 3.56% on average in two noisy settings.      
### 57.Triple-level Model Inferred Collaborative Network Architecture for Video Deraining  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04459.pdf)
>  Video deraining is an important issue for outdoor vision systems and has been investigated extensively. However, designing optimal architectures by the aggregating model formation and data distribution is a challenging task for video deraining. In this paper, we develop a model-guided triple-level optimization framework to deduce network architecture with cooperating optimization and auto-searching mechanism, named Triple-level Model Inferred Cooperating Searching (TMICS), for dealing with various video rain circumstances. In particular, to mitigate the problem that existing methods cannot cover various rain streaks distribution, we first design a hyper-parameter optimization model about task variable and hyper-parameter. Based on the proposed optimization model, we design a collaborative structure for video deraining. This structure includes Dominant Network Architecture (DNA) and Companionate Network Architecture (CNA) that is cooperated by introducing an Attention-based Averaging Scheme (AAS). To better explore inter-frame information from videos, we introduce a macroscopic structure searching scheme that searches from Optical Flow Module (OFM) and Temporal Grouping Module (TGM) to help restore latent frame. In addition, we apply the differentiable neural architecture searching from a compact candidate set of task-specific operations to discover desirable rain streaks removal architectures automatically. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our model shows significant improvements in fidelity and temporal consistency over the state-of-the-art works.

### 58.Get a Model! Model Hijacking Attack Against Machine Learning Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04394.pdf)
>  Machine learning (ML) has established itself as a cornerstone for various critical applications ranging from autonomous driving to authentication systems. However, with this increasing adoption rate of machine learning models, multiple attacks have emerged. One class of such attacks is training time attack, whereby an adversary executes their attack before or during the machine learning model training. In this work, we propose a new training time attack against computer vision based machine learning models, namely model hijacking attack. The adversary aims to hijack a target model to execute a different task than its original one without the model owner noticing. Model hijacking can cause accountability and security risks since a hijacked model owner can be framed for having their model offering illegal or unethical services. Model hijacking attacks are launched in the same way as existing data poisoning attacks. However, one requirement of the model hijacking attack is to be stealthy, i.e., the data samples used to hijack the target model should look similar to the model's original training dataset. To this end, we propose two different model hijacking attacks, namely Chameleon and Adverse Chameleon, based on a novel encoder-decoder style ML model, namely the Camouflager. Our evaluation shows that both of our model hijacking attacks achieve a high attack success rate, with a negligible drop in model utility.      
### 59.Off-policy Imitation Learning from Visual Inputs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04345.pdf)
>  Recently, various successful applications utilizing expert states in imitation learning (IL) have been witnessed. However, another IL setting -- IL from visual inputs (ILfVI), which has a greater promise to be applied in reality by utilizing online visual resources, suffers from low data-efficiency and poor performance resulted from an on-policy learning manner and high-dimensional visual inputs. We propose OPIfVI (Off-Policy Imitation from Visual Inputs), which is composed of an off-policy learning manner, data augmentation, and encoder techniques, to tackle the mentioned challenges, respectively. More specifically, to improve data-efficiency, OPIfVI conducts IL in an off-policy manner, with which sampled data can be used multiple times. In addition, we enhance the stability of OPIfVI with spectral normalization to mitigate the side-effect of off-policy training. The core factor, contributing to the poor performance of ILfVI, that we think is the agent could not extract meaningful features from visual inputs. Hence, OPIfVI employs data augmentation from computer vision to help train encoders that can better extract features from visual inputs. In addition, a specific structure of gradient backpropagation for the encoder is designed to stabilize the encoder training. At last, we demonstrate that OPIfVI is able to achieve expert-level performance and outperform existing baselines no matter visual demonstrations or visual observations are provided via extensive experiments using DeepMind Control Suite.      
### 60.Auto-Encoding Knowledge Graph for Unsupervised Medical Report Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04318.pdf)
>  Medical report generation, which aims to automatically generate a long and coherent report of a given medical image, has been receiving growing research interests. Existing approaches mainly adopt a supervised manner and heavily rely on coupled image-report pairs. However, in the medical domain, building a large-scale image-report paired dataset is both time-consuming and expensive. To relax the dependency on paired data, we propose an unsupervised model Knowledge Graph Auto-Encoder (KGAE) which accepts independent sets of images and reports in training. KGAE consists of a pre-constructed knowledge graph, a knowledge-driven encoder and a knowledge-driven decoder. The knowledge graph works as the shared latent space to bridge the visual and textual domains; The knowledge-driven encoder projects medical images and reports to the corresponding coordinates in this latent space and the knowledge-driven decoder generates a medical report given a coordinate in this space. Since the knowledge-driven encoder and decoder can be trained with independent sets of images and reports, KGAE is unsupervised. The experiments show that the unsupervised KGAE generates desirable medical reports without using any image-report training pairs. Moreover, KGAE can also work in both semi-supervised and supervised settings, and accept paired images and reports in training. By further fine-tuning with image-report pairs, KGAE consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on two datasets.      
### 61.A Relational Model for One-Shot Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04313.pdf)
>  We show that a deep learning model with built-in relational inductive bias can bring benefits to sample-efficient learning, without relying on extensive data augmentation. The proposed one-shot classification model performs relational matching of a pair of inputs in the form of local and pairwise attention. Our approach solves perfectly the one-shot image classification Omniglot challenge. Our model exceeds human level accuracy, as well as the previous state of the art, with no data augmentation.      
### 62.Adaptive area-preserving parameterization of open and closed anatomical surfaces  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04265.pdf)
>  The parameterization of open and closed anatomical surfaces is of fundamental importance in many biomedical applications. Spherical harmonics, a set of basis functions defined on the unit sphere, are widely used for anatomical shape description. However, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the object surface and the entire unit sphere may induce a large geometric distortion in case the shape of the surface is too different from a perfect sphere. In this work, we propose adaptive area-preserving parameterization methods for simply-connected open and closed surfaces with the target of the parameterization being a spherical cap. Our methods optimize the shape of the parameter domain along with the mapping from the object surface to the parameter domain. The object surface will be globally mapped to an optimal spherical cap region of the unit sphere in an area-preserving manner while also exhibiting low conformal distortion. We further develop a set of spherical harmonics-like basis functions defined over the adaptive spherical cap domain, which we call the adaptive harmonics. Experimental results show that the proposed parameterization methods outperform the existing methods for both open and closed anatomical surfaces in terms of area and angle distortion. Surface description of the object surfaces can be effectively achieved using a novel combination of the adaptive parameterization and the adaptive harmonics. Our work provides a novel way of mapping anatomical surfaces with improved accuracy and greater flexibility. More broadly, the idea of using an adaptive parameter domain allows easy handling of a wide range of biomedical shapes.      
### 63.Dense Representative Tooth Landmark/axis Detection Network on 3D Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04212.pdf)
>  Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is increasingly used for digital orthodontics, but one of the challenges is to automatically and accurately detect tooth landmarks and axes. This is partly because of sophisticated geometric definitions of them, and partly due to large variations among individual tooth and across different types of tooth. As such, we propose a deep learning approach with a labeled dataset by professional dentists to the tooth landmark/axis detection on tooth model that are crucial for orthodontic treatments. Our method can extract not only tooth landmarks in the form of point (e.g. cusps), but also axes that measure the tooth angulation and inclination. The proposed network takes as input a 3D tooth model and predicts various types of the tooth landmarks and axes. Specifically, we encode the landmarks and axes as dense fields defined on the surface of the tooth model. This design choice and a set of added components make the proposed network more suitable for extracting sparse landmarks from a given 3D tooth model. Extensive evaluation of the proposed method was conducted on a set of dental models prepared by experienced dentists. Results show that our method can produce tooth landmarks with high accuracy. Our method was examined and justified via comparison with the state-of-the-art methods as well as the ablation studies.      
### 64.Hierarchical Segment-based Optimization for SLAM  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04101.pdf)
>  This paper presents a hierarchical segment-based optimization method for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system. First we propose a reliable trajectory segmentation method that can be used to increase efficiency in the back-end optimization. Then we propose a buffer mechanism for the first time to improve the robustness of the segmentation. During the optimization, we use global information to optimize the frames with large error, and interpolation instead of optimization to update well-estimated frames to hierarchically allocate the amount of computation according to error of each frame. Comparative experiments on the benchmark show that our method greatly improves the efficiency of optimization with almost no drop in accuracy, and outperforms existing high-efficiency optimization method by a large margin.      
### 65.Online Adaptation of Monocular Depth Prediction with Visual SLAM  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04096.pdf)
>  The ability of accurate depth prediction by a CNN is a major challenge for its wide use in practical visual SLAM applications, such as enhanced camera tracking and dense mapping. This paper is set out to answer the following question: Can we tune a depth prediction CNN with the help of a visual SLAM algorithm even if the CNN is not trained for the current operating environment in order to benefit the SLAM performance? To this end, we propose a novel online adaptation framework consisting of two complementary processes: a SLAM algorithm that is used to generate keyframes to fine-tune the depth prediction and another algorithm that uses the online adapted depth to improve map quality. Once the potential noisy map points are removed, we perform global photometric bundle adjustment (BA) to improve the overall SLAM performance. Experimental results on both benchmark datasets and a real robot in our own experimental environments show that our proposed method improves the SLAM reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate the use of regularization in the training loss as an effective means to prevent catastrophic forgetting. In addition, we compare our online adaptation framework against the state-of-the-art pre-trained depth prediction CNNs to show that our online adapted depth prediction CNN outperforms the depth prediction CNNs that have been trained on a large collection of datasets.      
### 66.Acquisition-invariant brain MRI segmentation with informative uncertainties  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04094.pdf)
>  Combining multi-site data can strengthen and uncover trends, but is a task that is marred by the influence of site-specific covariates that can bias the data and therefore any downstream analyses. Post-hoc multi-site correction methods exist but have strong assumptions that often do not hold in real-world scenarios. Algorithms should be designed in a way that can account for site-specific effects, such as those that arise from sequence parameter choices, and in instances where generalisation fails, should be able to identify such a failure by means of explicit uncertainty modelling. This body of work showcases such an algorithm, that can become robust to the physics of acquisition in the context of segmentation tasks, while simultaneously modelling uncertainty. We demonstrate that our method not only generalises to complete holdout datasets, preserving segmentation quality, but does so while also accounting for site-specific sequence choices, which also allows it to perform as a harmonisation tool.      
### 67.Texture-enhanced Light Field Super-resolution with Spatio-Angular Decomposition Kernels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04069.pdf)
>  Despite the recent progress in light field super-resolution (LFSR) achieved by convolutional neural networks, the correlation information of light field (LF) images has not been sufficiently studied and exploited due to the complexity of 4D LF data. To cope with such high-dimensional LF data, most of the existing LFSR methods resorted to decomposing it into lower dimensions and subsequently performing optimization on the decomposed sub-spaces. However, these methods are inherently limited as they neglected the characteristics of the decomposition operations and only utilized a limited set of LF sub-spaces ending up failing to comprehensively extract spatio-angular features and leading to a performance bottleneck. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we thoroughly discover the potentials of LF decomposition and propose a novel concept of decomposition kernels. In particular, we systematically unify the decomposition operations of various sub-spaces into a series of such decomposition kernels, which are incorporated into our proposed Decomposition Kernel Network (DKNet) for comprehensive spatio-angular feature extraction. The proposed DKNet is experimentally verified to achieve substantial improvements by 1.35 dB, 0.83 dB, and 1.80 dB PSNR in 2x, 3x and 4x LFSR scales, respectively, when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. To further improve DKNet in producing more visually pleasing LFSR results, based on the VGG network, we propose a LFVGG loss to guide the Texture-Enhanced DKNet (TE-DKNet) to generate rich authentic textures and enhance LF images' visual quality significantly. We also propose an indirect evaluation metric by taking advantage of LF material recognition to objectively assess the perceptual enhancement brought by the LFVGG loss.      
### 68.Can viewer proximity be a behavioural marker for Autism Spectrum Disorder?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04064.pdf)
>  Screening for any of the Autism Spectrum Disorders is a complicated process often involving a hybrid of behavioural observations and questionnaire based tests. Typically carried out in a controlled setting, this process requires trained clinicians or psychiatrists for such assessments. Riding on the wave of technical advancement in mobile platforms, several attempts have been made at incorporating such assessments on mobile and tablet devices. <br>In this paper we analyse videos generated using one such screening test. This paper reports the first use of the efficacy of using the observer's distance from the display screen while administering a sensory sensitivity test as a behavioural marker for autism for children aged 2-7 years The potential for using a test such as this in casual home settings is promising.      
### 69.Information Extraction from Visually Rich Documents with Font Style Embeddings  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04045.pdf)
>  Information extraction (IE) from documents is an intensive area of research with a large set of industrial applications. Current state-of-the-art methods focus on scanned documents with approaches combining computer vision, natural language processing and layout representation. We propose to challenge the usage of computer vision in the case where both token style and visual representation are available (i.e native PDF documents). Our experiments on three real-world complex datasets demonstrate that using token style attributes based embedding instead of a raw visual embedding in LayoutLM model is beneficial. Depending on the dataset, such an embedding yields an improvement of 0.18% to 2.29% in the weighted F1-score with a decrease of 30.7% in the final number of trainable parameters of the model, leading to an improvement in both efficiency and effectiveness.      
### 70.Multi-Fake Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks for Imbalance Hyperspectral Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04019.pdf)
>  This paper presents a novel multi-fake evolutionary generative adversarial network(MFEGAN) for handling imbalance hyperspectral image classification. It is an end-to-end approach in which different generative objective losses are considered in the generator network to improve the classification performance of the discriminator network. Thus, the same discriminator network has been used as a standard classifier by embedding the classifier network on top of the discriminating function. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated through two hyperspectral spatial-spectral data sets. The same generative and discriminator architectures have been utilized with two different GAN objectives for a fair performance comparison with the proposed method. It is observed from the experimental validations that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with better classification performance.      
### 71.The Three-Dimensional Structural Configuration of the Central Retinal Vessel Trunk and Branches as a Glaucoma Biomarker  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03997.pdf)
>  Purpose: To assess whether the three-dimensional (3D) structural configuration of the central retinal vessel trunk and its branches (CRVT&amp;B) could be used as a diagnostic marker for glaucoma. Method: We trained a deep learning network to automatically segment the CRVT&amp;B from the B-scans of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume of the optic nerve head (ONH). Subsequently, two different approaches were used for glaucoma diagnosis using the structural configuration of the CRVT&amp;B as extracted from the OCT volumes. In the first approach, we aimed to provide a diagnosis using only 3D CNN and the 3D structure of the CRVT&amp;B. For the second approach, we projected the 3D structure of the CRVT&amp;B orthographically onto three planes to obtain 2D images, and then a 2D CNN was used for diagnosis. The segmentation accuracy was evaluated using the Dice coefficient, whereas the diagnostic accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The diagnostic performance of the CRVT&amp;B was also compared with that of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. Results: Our segmentation network was able to efficiently segment retinal blood vessels from OCT scans. On a test set, we achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.81\pm0.07. The 3D and 2D diagnostic networks were able to differentiate glaucoma from non-glaucoma subjects with accuracies of 82.7% and 83.3%, respectively. The corresponding AUCs for CRVT&amp;B were 0.89 and 0.90, higher than those obtained with RNFL thickness alone. Conclusions: Our work demonstrated that the diagnostic power of the CRVT&amp;B is superior to that of a gold-standard glaucoma parameter, i.e., RNFL thickness. Our work also suggested that the major retinal blood vessels form a skeleton -- the configuration of which may be representative of major ONH structural changes as typically observed with the development and progression of glaucoma.      
### 72.NarrationBot and InfoBot: A Hybrid System for Automated Video Description  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03994.pdf)
>  Video accessibility is crucial for blind and low vision users for equitable engagements in education, employment, and entertainment. Despite the availability of professional and amateur services and tools, most human-generated descriptions are expensive and time consuming. Moreover, the rate of human-generated descriptions cannot match the speed of video production. To overcome the increasing gaps in video accessibility, we developed a hybrid system of two tools to 1) automatically generate descriptions for videos and 2) provide answers or additional descriptions in response to user queries on a video. Results from a mixed-methods study with 26 blind and low vision individuals show that our system significantly improved user comprehension and enjoyment of selected videos when both tools were used in tandem. In addition, participants reported no significant difference in their ability to understand videos when presented with autogenerated descriptions versus human-revised autogenerated descriptions. Our results demonstrate user enthusiasm about the developed system and its promise for providing customized access to videos. We discuss the limitations of the current work and provide recommendations for the future development of automated video description tools.      
### 73.V-MAO: Generative Modeling for Multi-Arm Manipulation of Articulated Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03987.pdf)
>  Manipulating articulated objects requires multiple robot arms in general. It is challenging to enable multiple robot arms to collaboratively complete manipulation tasks on articulated objects. In this paper, we present $\textbf{V-MAO}$, a framework for learning multi-arm manipulation of articulated objects. Our framework includes a variational generative model that learns contact point distribution over object rigid parts for each robot arm. The training signal is obtained from interaction with the simulation environment which is enabled by planning and a novel formulation of object-centric control for articulated objects. We deploy our framework in a customized MuJoCo simulation environment and demonstrate that our framework achieves a high success rate on six different objects and two different robots. We also show that generative modeling can effectively learn the contact point distribution on articulated objects.      
### 74.Demystifying Deep Learning Models for Retinal OCT Disease Classification using Explainable AI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03890.pdf)
>  In the world of medical diagnostics, the adoption of various deep learning techniques is quite common as well as effective, and its statement is equally true when it comes to implementing it into the retina Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) sector, but (i)These techniques have the black box characteristics that prevent the medical professionals to completely trust the results generated from them (ii)Lack of precision of these methods restricts their implementation in clinical and complex cases (iii)The existing works and models on the OCT classification are substantially large and complicated and they require a considerable amount of memory and computational power, reducing the quality of classifiers in real-time applications. To meet these problems, in this paper a self-developed CNN model has been proposed which is comparatively smaller and simpler along with the use of Lime that introduces Explainable AI to the study and helps to increase the interpretability of the model. This addition will be an asset to the medical experts for getting major and detailed information and will help them in making final decisions and will also reduce the opacity and vulnerability of the conventional deep learning models.      
### 75.A new baseline for retinal vessel segmentation: Numerical identification and correction of methodological inconsistencies affecting 100+ papers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03853.pdf)
>  In the last 15 years, the segmentation of vessels in retinal images has become an intensively researched problem in medical imaging, with hundreds of algorithms published. One of the de facto benchmarking data sets of vessel segmentation techniques is the DRIVE data set. Since DRIVE contains a predefined split of training and test images, the published performance results of the various segmentation techniques should provide a reliable ranking of the algorithms. Including more than 100 papers in the study, we performed a detailed numerical analysis of the coherence of the published performance scores. We found inconsistencies in the reported scores related to the use of the field of view (FoV), which has a significant impact on the performance scores. We attempted to eliminate the biases using numerical techniques to provide a more realistic picture of the state of the art. Based on the results, we have formulated several findings, most notably: despite the well-defined test set of DRIVE, most rankings in published papers are based on non-comparable figures; in contrast to the near-perfect accuracy scores reported in the literature, the highest accuracy score achieved to date is 0.9582 in the FoV region, which is 1% higher than that of human annotators. The methods we have developed for identifying and eliminating the evaluation biases can be easily applied to other domains where similar problems may arise.      
### 76.Multimodal PET/CT Tumour Segmentation and Prediction of Progression-Free Survival using a Full-Scale UNet with Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03848.pdf)
>  Segmentation of head and neck (H\&amp;N) tumours and prediction of patient outcome are crucial for patient's disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Current developments of robust deep learning models are hindered by the lack of large multi-centre, multi-modal data with quality annotations. The MICCAI 2021 HEad and neCK TumOR (HECKTOR) segmentation and outcome prediction challenge creates a platform for comparing segmentation methods of the primary gross target volume on fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and Computed Tomography images and prediction of progression-free survival in H\&amp;N oropharyngeal cancer.For the segmentation task, we proposed a new network based on an encoder-decoder architecture with full inter- and intra-skip connections to take advantage of low-level and high-level semantics at full scales. Additionally, we used Conditional Random Fields as a post-processing step to refine the predicted segmentation maps. We trained multiple neural networks for tumor volume segmentation, and these segmentations were ensembled achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.75 in cross-validation, and 0.76 on the challenge testing data set. For prediction of patient progression free survival task, we propose a Cox proportional hazard regression combining clinical, radiomic, and deep learning features. Our survival prediction model achieved a concordance index of 0.82 in cross-validation, and 0.62 on the challenge testing data set.      
### 77.Order-Guided Disentangled Representation Learning for Ulcerative Colitis Classification with Limited Labels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03815.pdf)
>  Ulcerative colitis (UC) classification, which is an important task for endoscopic diagnosis, involves two main difficulties. First, endoscopic images with the annotation about UC (positive or negative) are usually limited. Second, they show a large variability in their appearance due to the location in the colon. Especially, the second difficulty prevents us from using existing semi-supervised learning techniques, which are the common remedy for the first difficulty. In this paper, we propose a practical semi-supervised learning method for UC classification by newly exploiting two additional features, the location in a colon (e.g., left colon) and image capturing order, both of which are often attached to individual images in endoscopic image sequences. The proposed method can extract the essential information of UC classification efficiently by a disentanglement process with those features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several existing semi-supervised learning methods in the classification task, even with a small number of annotated images.      
### 78.Neural BRDFs: Representation and Operations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03797.pdf)
>  Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) are pervasively used in computer graphics to produce realistic physically-based appearance. In recent years, several works explored using neural networks to represent BRDFs, taking advantage of neural networks' high compression rate and their ability to fit highly complex functions. However, once represented, the BRDFs will be fixed and therefore lack flexibility to take part in follow-up operations. In this paper, we present a form of "Neural BRDF algebra", and focus on both representation and operations of BRDFs at the same time. We propose a representation neural network to compress BRDFs into latent vectors, which is able to represent BRDFs accurately. We further propose several operations that can be applied solely in the latent space, such as layering and interpolation. Spatial variation is straightforward to achieve by using textures of latent vectors. Furthermore, our representation can be efficiently evaluated and sampled, providing a competitive solution to more expensive Monte Carlo layering approaches.      
### 79.Artifact- and content-specific quality assessment for MRI with image rulers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03780.pdf)
>  In clinical practice MR images are often first seen by radiologists long after the scan. If image quality is inadequate either patients have to return for an additional scan, or a suboptimal interpretation is rendered. An automatic image quality assessment (IQA) would enable real-time remediation. Existing IQA works for MRI give only a general quality score, agnostic to the cause of and solution to low-quality scans. Furthermore, radiologists' image quality requirements vary with the scan type and diagnostic task. Therefore, the same score may have different implications for different scans. We propose a framework with multi-task CNN model trained with calibrated labels and inferenced with image rulers. Labels calibrated by human inputs follow a well-defined and efficient labeling task. Image rulers address varying quality standards and provide a concrete way of interpreting raw scores from the CNN. The model supports assessments of two of the most common artifacts in MRI: noise and motion. It achieves accuracies of around 90%, 6% better than the best previous method examined, and 3% better than human experts on noise assessment. Our experiments show that label calibration, image rulers, and multi-task training improve the model's performance and generalizability.      
### 80.MQBench: Towards Reproducible and Deployable Model Quantization Benchmark  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03759.pdf)
>  Model quantization has emerged as an indispensable technique to accelerate deep learning inference. While researchers continue to push the frontier of quantization algorithms, existing quantization work is often unreproducible and undeployable. This is because researchers do not choose consistent training pipelines and ignore the requirements for hardware deployments. In this work, we propose Model Quantization Benchmark (MQBench), a first attempt to evaluate, analyze, and benchmark the reproducibility and deployability for model quantization algorithms. We choose multiple different platforms for real-world deployments, including CPU, GPU, ASIC, DSP, and evaluate extensive state-of-the-art quantization algorithms under a unified training pipeline. MQBench acts like a bridge to connect the algorithm and the hardware. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and find considerable intuitive or counter-intuitive insights. By aligning the training settings, we find existing algorithms have about the same performance on the conventional academic track. While for the hardware-deployable quantization, there is a huge accuracy gap which remains unsettled. Surprisingly, no existing algorithm wins every challenge in MQBench, and we hope this work could inspire future research directions.      
### 81.Explaining neural network predictions of material strength  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03729.pdf)
>  We recently developed a deep learning method that can determine the critical peak stress of a material by looking at scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the material's crystals. However, it has been somewhat unclear what kind of image features the network is keying off of when it makes its prediction. It is common in computer vision to employ an explainable AI saliency map to tell one what parts of an image are important to the network's decision. One can usually deduce the important features by looking at these salient locations. However, SEM images of crystals are more abstract to the human observer than natural image photographs. As a result, it is not easy to tell what features are important at the locations which are most salient. To solve this, we developed a method that helps us map features from important locations in SEM images to non-abstract textures that are easier to interpret.      
### 82.Damage Estimation and Localization from Sparse Aerial Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03708.pdf)
>  Aerial images provide important situational awareness for responding to natural disasters such as hurricanes. They are well-suited for providing information for damage estimation and localization (DEL); i.e., characterizing the type and spatial extent of damage following a disaster. Despite recent advances in sensing and unmanned aerial systems technology, much of post-disaster aerial imagery is still taken by handheld DSLR cameras from small, manned, fixed-wing aircraft. However, these handheld cameras lack IMU information, and images are taken opportunistically post-event by operators. As such, DEL from such imagery is still a highly manual and time-consuming process. We propose an approach to both detect damage in aerial images and localize it in world coordinates, with specific focus on detecting and localizing flooding. The approach is based on using structure from motion to relate image coordinates to world coordinates via a projective transformation, using class activation mapping to detect the extent of damage in an image, and applying the projective transformation to localize damage in world coordinates. We evaluate the performance of our approach on post-event data from the 2016 Louisiana floods, and find that our approach achieves a precision of 88%. Given this high precision using limited data, we argue that this approach is currently viable for fast and effective DEL from handheld aerial imagery for disaster response.      
### 83.Reconstructing Training Data from Diverse ML Models by Ensemble Inversion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03702.pdf)
>  Model Inversion (MI), in which an adversary abuses access to a trained Machine Learning (ML) model attempting to infer sensitive information about its original training data, has attracted increasing research attention. During MI, the trained model under attack (MUA) is usually frozen and used to guide the training of a generator, such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to reconstruct the distribution of the original training data of that model. This might cause leakage of original training samples, and if successful, the privacy of dataset subjects will be at risk if the training data contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Therefore, an in-depth investigation of the potentials of MI techniques is crucial for the development of corresponding defense techniques. High-quality reconstruction of training data based on a single model is challenging. However, existing MI literature does not explore targeting multiple models jointly, which may provide additional information and diverse perspectives to the adversary. <br>We propose the ensemble inversion technique that estimates the distribution of original training data by training a generator constrained by an ensemble (or set) of trained models with shared subjects or entities. This technique leads to noticeable improvements of the quality of the generated samples with distinguishable features of the dataset entities compared to MI of a single ML model. We achieve high quality results without any dataset and show how utilizing an auxiliary dataset that's similar to the presumed training data improves the results. The impact of model diversity in the ensemble is thoroughly investigated and additional constraints are utilized to encourage sharp predictions and high activations for the reconstructed samples, leading to more accurate reconstruction of training images.      
### 84.First steps on Gamification of Lung Fluid Cells Annotations in the Flower Domain  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03663.pdf)
>  Annotating data, especially in the medical domain, requires expert knowledge and a lot of effort. This limits the amount and/or usefulness of available medical data sets for experimentation. Therefore, developing strategies to increase the number of annotations while lowering the needed domain knowledge is of interest. A possible strategy is the use of gamification, that is i.e. transforming the annotation task into a game. We propose an approach to gamify the task of annotating lung fluid cells from pathological whole slide images. As this domain is unknown to non-expert annotators, we transform images of cells detected with a RetinaNet architecture to the domain of flower images. This domain transfer is performed with a CycleGAN architecture for different cell types. In this more assessable domain, non-expert annotators can be (t)asked to annotate different kinds of flowers in a playful setting. In order to provide a proof of concept, this work shows that the domain transfer is possible by evaluating an image classification network trained on real cell images and tested on the cell images generated by the CycleGAN network. The classification network reaches an accuracy of 97.48% and 95.16% on the original lung fluid cells and transformed lung fluid cells, respectively. With this study, we lay the foundation for future research on gamification using CycleGANs.
