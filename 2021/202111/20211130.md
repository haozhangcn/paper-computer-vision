### 1.Nonuniform-to-Uniform Quantization: Towards Accurate Quantization via Generalized Straight-Through Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14826.pdf)
>  The nonuniform quantization strategy for compressing neural networks usually achieves better performance than its counterpart, i.e., uniform strategy, due to its superior representational capacity. However, many nonuniform quantization methods overlook the complicated projection process in implementing the nonuniformly quantized weights/activations, which incurs non-negligible time and space overhead in hardware deployment. In this study, we propose Nonuniform-to-Uniform Quantization (N2UQ), a method that can maintain the strong representation ability of nonuniform methods while being hardware-friendly and efficient as the uniform quantization for model inference. We achieve this through learning the flexible in-equidistant input thresholds to better fit the underlying distribution while quantizing these real-valued inputs into equidistant output levels. To train the quantized network with learnable input thresholds, we introduce a generalized straight-through estimator (G-STE) for intractable backward derivative calculation w.r.t. threshold parameters. Additionally, we consider entropy preserving regularization to further reduce information loss in weight quantization. Even under this adverse constraint of imposing uniformly quantized weights and activations, our N2UQ outperforms state-of-the-art nonuniform quantization methods by 0.7~1.8% on ImageNet, demonstrating the contribution of N2UQ design. Code will be made publicly available.      
### 2.Latent Transformations via NeuralODEs for GAN-based Image Editing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14825.pdf)
>  Recent advances in high-fidelity semantic image editing heavily rely on the presumably disentangled latent spaces of the state-of-the-art generative models, such as StyleGAN. Specifically, recent works show that it is possible to achieve decent controllability of attributes in face images via linear shifts along with latent directions. Several recent methods address the discovery of such directions, implicitly assuming that the state-of-the-art GANs learn the latent spaces with inherently linearly separable attribute distributions and semantic vector arithmetic properties. <br>In our work, we show that nonlinear latent code manipulations realized as flows of a trainable Neural ODE are beneficial for many practical non-face image domains with more complex non-textured factors of variation. In particular, we investigate a large number of datasets with known attributes and demonstrate that certain attribute manipulations are challenging to obtain with linear shifts only.      
### 3.Learning to Fit Morphable Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14824.pdf)
>  Fitting parametric models of human bodies, hands or faces to sparse input signals in an accurate, robust, and fast manner has the promise of significantly improving immersion in AR and VR scenarios. A common first step in systems that tackle these problems is to regress the parameters of the parametric model directly from the input data. This approach is fast, robust, and is a good starting point for an iterative minimization algorithm. The latter searches for the minimum of an energy function, typically composed of a data term and priors that encode our knowledge about the problem's structure. While this is undoubtedly a very successful recipe, priors are often hand defined heuristics and finding the right balance between the different terms to achieve high quality results is a non-trivial task. Furthermore, converting and optimizing these systems to run in a performant way requires custom implementations that demand significant time investments from both engineers and domain experts. In this work, we build upon recent advances in learned optimization and propose an update rule inspired by the classic Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed neural optimizer on the problems of 3D body surface estimation from a head-mounted device and face fitting from 2D landmarks. Our method can easily be applied to new model fitting problems and offers a competitive alternative to well tuned 'traditional' model fitting pipelines, both in terms of accuracy and speed.      
### 4.Vector Quantized Diffusion Model for Text-to-Image Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14822.pdf)
>  We present the vector quantized diffusion (VQ-Diffusion) model for text-to-image generation. This method is based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) whose latent space is modeled by a conditional variant of the recently developed Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). We find that this latent-space method is well-suited for text-to-image generation tasks because it not only eliminates the unidirectional bias with existing methods but also allows us to incorporate a mask-and-replace diffusion strategy to avoid the accumulation of errors, which is a serious problem with existing methods. Our experiments show that the VQ-Diffusion produces significantly better text-to-image generation results when compared with conventional autoregressive (AR) models with similar numbers of parameters. Compared with previous GAN-based text-to-image methods, our VQ-Diffusion can handle more complex scenes and improve the synthesized image quality by a large margin. Finally, we show that the image generation computation in our method can be made highly efficient by reparameterization. With traditional AR methods, the text-to-image generation time increases linearly with the output image resolution and hence is quite time consuming even for normal size images. The VQ-Diffusion allows us to achieve a better trade-off between quality and speed. Our experiments indicate that the VQ-Diffusion model with the reparameterization is fifteen times faster than traditional AR methods while achieving a better image quality.      
### 5.End-to-End Referring Video Object Segmentation with Multimodal Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14821.pdf)
>  The referring video object segmentation task (RVOS) involves segmentation of a text-referred object instance in the frames of a given video. Due to the complex nature of this multimodal task, which combines text reasoning, video understanding, instance segmentation and tracking, existing approaches typically rely on sophisticated pipelines in order to tackle it. In this paper, we propose a simple Transformer-based approach to RVOS. Our framework, termed Multimodal Tracking Transformer (MTTR), models the RVOS task as a sequence prediction problem. Following recent advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, MTTR is based on the realization that video and text can both be processed together effectively and elegantly by a single multimodal Transformer model. MTTR is end-to-end trainable, free of text-related inductive bias components and requires no additional mask-refinement post-processing steps. As such, it simplifies the RVOS pipeline considerably compared to existing methods. Evaluation on standard benchmarks reveals that MTTR significantly outperforms previous art across multiple metrics. In particular, MTTR shows impressive +5.7 and +5.0 mAP gains on the A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences datasets respectively, while processing 76 frames per second. In addition, we report strong results on the public validation set of Refer-YouTube-VOS, a more challenging RVOS dataset that has yet to receive the attention of researchers.

### 6.Point-BERT: Pre-training 3D Point Cloud Transformers with Masked Point Modeling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14819.pdf)
>  We present Point-BERT, a new paradigm for learning Transformers to generalize the concept of BERT to 3D point cloud. Inspired by BERT, we devise a Masked Point Modeling (MPM) task to pre-train point cloud Transformers. Specifically, we first divide a point cloud into several local point patches, and a point cloud Tokenizer with a discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) is designed to generate discrete point tokens containing meaningful local information. Then, we randomly mask out some patches of input point clouds and feed them into the backbone Transformers. The pre-training objective is to recover the original point tokens at the masked locations under the supervision of point tokens obtained by the Tokenizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BERT-style pre-training strategy significantly improves the performance of standard point cloud Transformers. Equipped with our pre-training strategy, we show that a pure Transformer architecture attains 93.8% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 83.1% accuracy on the hardest setting of ScanObjectNN, surpassing carefully designed point cloud models with much fewer hand-made designs. We also demonstrate that the representations learned by Point-BERT transfer well to new tasks and domains, where our models largely advance the state-of-the-art of few-shot point cloud classification task. The code and pre-trained models are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/lulutang0608/Point-BERT" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 7.Blended Diffusion for Text-driven Editing of Natural Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14818.pdf)
>  Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for image editing. In this paper, we introduce the first solution for performing local (region-based) edits in generic natural images, based on a natural language description along with an ROI mask. We achieve our goal by leveraging and combining a pretrained language-image model (CLIP), to steer the edit towards a user-provided text prompt, with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate natural-looking results. To seamlessly fuse the edited region with the unchanged parts of the image, we spatially blend noised versions of the input image with the local text-guided diffusion latent at a progression of noise levels. In addition, we show that adding augmentations to the diffusion process mitigates adversarial results. We compare against several baselines and related methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and show that our method outperforms these solutions in terms of overall realism, ability to preserve the background and matching the text. Finally, we show several text-driven editing applications, including adding a new object to an image, removing/replacing/altering existing objects, background replacement, and image extrapolation.      
### 8.TransWeather: Transformer-based Restoration of Images Degraded by Adverse Weather Conditions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14813.pdf)
>  Removing adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow from images is an important problem in many applications. Most methods proposed in the literature have been designed to deal with just removing one type of degradation. Recently, a CNN-based method using neural architecture search (All-in-One) was proposed to remove all the weather conditions at once. However, it has a large number of parameters as it uses multiple encoders to cater to each weather removal task and still has scope for improvement in its performance. In this work, we focus on developing an efficient solution for the all adverse weather removal problem. To this end, we propose TransWeather, a transformer-based end-to-end model with just a single encoder and a decoder that can restore an image degraded by any weather condition. Specifically, we utilize a novel transformer encoder using intra-patch transformer blocks to enhance attention inside the patches to effectively remove smaller weather degradations. We also introduce a transformer decoder with learnable weather type embeddings to adjust to the weather degradation at hand. TransWeather achieves significant improvements across multiple test datasets over both All-in-One network as well as methods fine-tuned for specific tasks. In particular, TransWeather pushes the current state-of-the-art by +6.34 PSNR on the Test1 (rain+fog) dataset, +4.93 PSNR on the SnowTest100K-L dataset and +3.11 PSNR on the RainDrop test dataset. TransWeather is also validated on real world test images and found to be more effective than previous methods.

### 9.Coarse-To-Fine Incremental Few-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14806.pdf)
>  Different from fine-tuning models pre-trained on a large-scale dataset of preset classes, class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to recognize novel classes over time without forgetting pre-trained classes. However, a given model will be challenged by test images with finer-grained classes, e.g., a basenji is at most recognized as a dog. Such images form a new training set (i.e., support set) so that the incremental model is hoped to recognize a basenji (i.e., query) as a basenji next time. This paper formulates such a hybrid natural problem of coarse-to-fine few-shot (C2FS) recognition as a CIL problem named C2FSCIL, and proposes a simple, effective, and theoretically-sound strategy Knowe: to learn, normalize, and freeze a classifier's weights from fine labels, once learning an embedding space contrastively from coarse labels. Besides, as CIL aims at a stability-plasticity balance, new overall performance metrics are proposed. In that sense, on CIFAR-100, BREEDS, and tieredImageNet, Knowe outperforms all recent relevant CIL/FSCIL methods that are tailored to the new problem setting for the first time.      
### 10.UBoCo : Unsupervised Boundary Contrastive Learning for Generic Event Boundary Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14799.pdf)
>  Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) is a newly suggested video understanding task that aims to find one level deeper semantic boundaries of events. Bridging the gap between natural human perception and video understanding, it has various potential applications, including interpretable and semantically valid video parsing. Still at an early development stage, existing GEBD solvers are simple extensions of relevant video understanding tasks, disregarding GEBD's distinctive characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised/supervised GEBD, by using the Temporal Self-similarity Matrix (TSM) as the video representation. The new Recursive TSM Parsing (RTP) algorithm exploits local diagonal patterns in TSM to detect boundaries, and it is combined with the Boundary Contrastive (BoCo) loss to train our encoder to generate more informative TSMs. Our framework can be applied to both unsupervised and supervised settings, with both achieving state-of-the-art performance by a huge margin in GEBD benchmark. Especially, our unsupervised method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art "supervised" model, implying its exceptional efficacy.      
### 11.Semi-supervised Implicit Scene Completion from Sparse LiDAR  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14798.pdf)
>  Recent advances show that semi-supervised implicit representation learning can be achieved through physical constraints like Eikonal equations. However, this scheme has not yet been successfully used for LiDAR point cloud data, due to its spatially varying sparsity. In this paper, we develop a novel formulation that conditions the semi-supervised implicit function on localized shape embeddings. It exploits the strong representation learning power of sparse convolutional networks to generate shape-aware dense feature volumes, while still allows semi-supervised signed distance function learning without knowing its exact values at free space. With extensive quantitative and qualitative results, we demonstrate intrinsic properties of this new learning system and its usefulness in real-world road scenes. Notably, we improve IoU from 26.3% to 51.0% on SemanticKITTI. Moreover, we explore two paradigms to integrate semantic label predictions, achieving implicit semantic completion.

### 12.Classification-Regression for Chart Comprehension  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14792.pdf)
>  Charts are a popular and effective form of data visualization. Chart question answering (CQA) is a task used for assessing chart comprehension, which is fundamentally different from understanding natural images. CQA requires analyzing the relationships between the textual and the visual components of a chart, in order to answer general questions or infer numerical values. Most existing CQA datasets and it models are based on simplifying assumptions that often enable surpassing human performance. In this work, we further explore the reasons behind this outcome and propose a new model that jointly learns classification and regression. Our language-vision set up with co-attention transformers captures the complex interactions between the question and the textual elements, which commonly exist in real-world charts. We validate these conclusions with extensive experiments and breakdowns on the realistic PlotQA dataset, outperforming previous approaches by a large margin, while showing competitive performance on FigureQA. Our model's edge is particularly emphasized on questions with out-of-vocabulary answers, many of which require regression. We hope that this work will stimulate further research towards solving the challenging and highly practical task of chart comprehension.      
### 13.Self-Supervised Pre-Training of Swin Transformers for 3D Medical Image Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14791.pdf)
>  Vision Transformers (ViT)s have shown great performance in self-supervised learning of global and local representations that can be transferred to downstream applications. Inspired by these results, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework with tailored proxy tasks for medical image analysis. Specifically, we propose: (i) a new 3D transformer-based model, dubbed Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR), with a hierarchical encoder for self-supervised pre-training; (ii) tailored proxy tasks for learning the underlying pattern of human anatomy. We demonstrate successful pre-training of the proposed model on 5,050 publicly available computed tomography (CT) images from various body organs. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by fine-tuning the pre-trained models on the Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV) Segmentation Challenge with 13 abdominal organs and segmentation tasks from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset. Our model is currently the state-of-the-art (i.e. ranked 1st) on the public test leaderboards of both MSD and BTCV datasets.

### 14.Deep Decomposition for Stochastic Normal-Abnormal Transport  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14777.pdf)
>  Advection-diffusion equations describe a large family of natural transport processes, e.g., fluid flow, heat transfer, and wind transport. They are also used for optical flow and perfusion imaging computations. We develop a machine learning model, D^2-SONATA, built upon a stochastic advection-diffusion equation, which predicts the velocity and diffusion fields that drive 2D/3D image time-series of transport. In particular, our proposed model incorporates a model of transport atypicality, which isolates abnormal differences between expected normal transport behavior and the observed transport. In a medical context such a normal-abnormal decomposition can be used, for example, to quantify pathologies. Specifically, our model identifies the advection and diffusion contributions from the transport time-series and simultaneously predicts an anomaly value field to provide a decomposition into normal and abnormal advection and diffusion behavior. To achieve improved estimation performance for the velocity and diffusion-tensor fields underlying the advection-diffusion process and for the estimation of the anomaly fields, we create a 2D/3D anomaly-encoded advection-diffusion simulator, which allows for supervised learning. We further apply our model on a brain perfusion dataset from ischemic stroke patients via transfer learning. Extensive comparisons demonstrate that our model successfully distinguishes stroke lesions (abnormal) from normal brain regions, while reconstructing the underlying velocity and diffusion tensor fields.      
### 15.Riemannian Functional Map Synchronization for Probabilistic Partial Correspondence in Shape Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14762.pdf)
>  Functional maps are efficient representations of shape correspondences, that provide matching of real-valued functions between pairs of shapes. Functional maps can be modelled as elements of the Lie group $SO(n)$ for nearly isometric shapes. Synchronization can subsequently be employed to enforce cycle consistency between functional maps computed on a set of shapes, hereby enhancing the accuracy of the individual maps. There is an interest in developing synchronization methods that respect the geometric structure of $SO(n)$, while introducing a probabilistic framework to quantify the uncertainty associated with the synchronization results. This paper introduces a Bayesian probabilistic inference framework on $SO(n)$ for Riemannian synchronization of functional maps, performs a maximum-a-posteriori estimation of functional maps through synchronization and further deploys a Riemannian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampler for uncertainty quantification. Our experiments demonstrate that constraining the synchronization on the Riemannian manifold $SO(n)$ improves the estimation of the functional maps, while our Riemannian MCMC sampler provides for the first time an uncertainty quantification of the results.      
### 16.A Simple Long-Tailed Recognition Baseline via Vision-Language Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14745.pdf)
>  The visual world naturally exhibits a long-tailed distribution of open classes, which poses great challenges to modern visual systems. Existing approaches either perform class re-balancing strategies or directly improve network modules to address the problem. However, they still train models with a finite set of predefined labels, limiting their supervision information and restricting their transferability to novel instances. Recent advances in large-scale contrastive visual-language pretraining shed light on a new pathway for visual recognition. With open-vocabulary supervisions, pretrained contrastive vision-language models learn powerful multimodal representations that are promising to handle data deficiency and unseen concepts. By calculating the semantic similarity between visual and text inputs, visual recognition is converted to a vision-language matching problem. Inspired by this, we propose BALLAD to leverage contrastive vision-language models for long-tailed recognition. We first continue pretraining the vision-language backbone through contrastive learning on a specific long-tailed target dataset. Afterward, we freeze the backbone and further employ an additional adapter layer to enhance the representations of tail classes on balanced training samples built with re-sampling strategies. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three popular long-tailed recognition benchmarks. As a result, our simple and effective approach sets the new state-of-the-art performances and outperforms competitive baselines with a large margin.

### 17.Domain Adaptation of Networks for Camera Pose Estimation: Learning Camera Pose Estimation Without Pose Labels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14741.pdf)
>  One of the key criticisms of deep learning is that large amounts of expensive and difficult-to-acquire training data are required in order to train models with high performance and good generalization capabilities. Focusing on the task of monocular camera pose estimation via scene coordinate regression (SCR), we describe a novel method, Domain Adaptation of Networks for Camera pose Estimation (DANCE), which enables the training of models without access to any labels on the target task. DANCE requires unlabeled images (without known poses, ordering, or scene coordinate labels) and a 3D representation of the space (e.g., a scanned point cloud), both of which can be captured with minimal effort using off-the-shelf commodity hardware. DANCE renders labeled synthetic images from the 3D model, and bridges the inevitable domain gap between synthetic and real images by applying unsupervised image-level domain adaptation techniques (unpaired image-to-image translation). When tested on real images, the SCR model trained with DANCE achieved comparable performance to its fully supervised counterpart (in both cases using PnP-RANSAC for final pose estimation) at a fraction of the cost.

### 18.Exploring Alignment of Representations with Human Perception  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14726.pdf)
>  We argue that a valuable perspective on when a model learns \textit{good} representations is that inputs that are mapped to similar representations by the model should be perceived similarly by humans. We use \textit{representation inversion} to generate multiple inputs that map to the same model representation, then quantify the perceptual similarity of these inputs via human surveys. Our approach yields a measure of the extent to which a model is aligned with human perception. Using this measure of alignment, we evaluate models trained with various learning paradigms (\eg~supervised and self-supervised learning) and different training losses (standard and robust training). Our results suggest that the alignment of representations with human perception provides useful additional insights into the qualities of a model. For example, we find that alignment with human perception can be used as a measure of trust in a model's prediction on inputs where different models have conflicting outputs. We also find that various properties of a model like its architecture, training paradigm, training loss, and data augmentation play a significant role in learning representations that are aligned with human perception.      
### 19.Searching the Search Space of Vision Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14725.pdf)
>  Vision Transformer has shown great visual representation power in substantial vision tasks such as recognition and detection, and thus been attracting fast-growing efforts on manually designing more effective architectures. In this paper, we propose to use neural architecture search to automate this process, by searching not only the architecture but also the search space. The central idea is to gradually evolve different search dimensions guided by their E-T Error computed using a weight-sharing supernet. Moreover, we provide design guidelines of general vision transformers with extensive analysis according to the space searching process, which could promote the understanding of vision transformer. Remarkably, the searched models, named S3 (short for Searching the Search Space), from the searched space achieve superior performance to recently proposed models, such as Swin, DeiT and ViT, when evaluated on ImageNet. The effectiveness of S3 is also illustrated on object detection, semantic segmentation and visual question answering, demonstrating its generality to downstream vision and vision-language tasks.

### 20.Real-time Attention Span Tracking in Online Education  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14707.pdf)
>  Over the last decade, e-learning has revolutionized how students learn by providing them access to quality education whenever and wherever they want. However, students often get distracted because of various reasons, which affect the learning capacity to a great extent. Many researchers have been trying to improve the quality of online education, but we need a holistic approach to address this issue. This paper intends to provide a mechanism that uses the camera feed and microphone input to monitor the real-time attention level of students during online classes. We explore various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms throughout this study. We propose a system that uses five distinct non-verbal features to calculate the attention score of the student during computer based tasks and generate real-time feedback for both students and the organization. We can use the generated feedback as a heuristic value to analyze the overall performance of students as well as the teaching standards of the lecturers.      
### 21.DanceTrack: Multi-Object Tracking in Uniform Appearance and Diverse Motion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14690.pdf)
>  A typical pipeline for multi-object tracking (MOT) is to use a detector for object localization, and following re-identification (re-ID) for object association. This pipeline is partially motivated by recent progress in both object detection and re-ID, and partially motivated by biases in existing tracking datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing appearance and re-ID models are sufficient for establishing associations. In response to such bias, we would like to re-emphasize that methods for multi-object tracking should also work when object appearance is not sufficiently discriminative. To this end, we propose a large-scale dataset for multi-human tracking, where humans have similar appearance, diverse motion and extreme articulation. As the dataset contains mostly group dancing videos, we name it "DanceTrack". We expect DanceTrack to provide a better platform to develop more MOT algorithms that rely less on visual discrimination and depend more on motion analysis. We benchmark several state-of-the-art trackers on our dataset and observe a significant performance drop on DanceTrack when compared against existing benchmarks. The dataset, project code and competition server are released at: \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/DanceTrack" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 22.Graph Embedding via High Dimensional Model Representation for Hyperspectral Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14680.pdf)
>  Learning the manifold structure of remote sensing images is of paramount relevance for modeling and understanding processes, as well as to encapsulate the high dimensionality in a reduced set of informative features for subsequent classification, regression, or unmixing. Manifold learning methods have shown excellent performance to deal with hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis but, unless specifically designed, they cannot provide an explicit embedding map readily applicable to out-of-sample data. A common assumption to deal with the problem is that the transformation between the high-dimensional input space and the (typically low) latent space is linear. This is a particularly strong assumption, especially when dealing with hyperspectral images due to the well-known nonlinear nature of the data. To address this problem, a manifold learning method based on High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) is proposed, which enables to present a nonlinear embedding function to project out-of-sample samples into the latent space. The proposed method is compared to manifold learning methods along with its linear counterparts and achieves promising performance in terms of classification accuracy of a representative set of hyperspectral images.      
### 23.3D Compositional Zero-shot Learning with DeCompositional Consensus  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14673.pdf)
>  Parts represent a basic unit of geometric and semantic similarity across different objects. We argue that part knowledge should be composable beyond the observed object classes. Towards this, we present 3D Compositional Zero-shot Learning as a problem of part generalization from seen to unseen object classes for semantic segmentation. We provide a structured study through benchmarking the task with the proposed Compositional-PartNet dataset. This dataset is created by processing the original PartNet to maximize part overlap across different objects. The existing point cloud part segmentation methods fail to generalize to unseen object classes in this setting. As a solution, we propose DeCompositional Consensus, which combines a part segmentation network with a part scoring network. The key intuition to our approach is that a segmentation mask over some parts should have a consensus with its part scores when each part is taken apart. The two networks reason over different part combinations defined in a per-object part prior to generate the most suitable segmentation mask. We demonstrate that our method allows compositional zero-shot segmentation and generalized zero-shot classification, and establishes the state of the art on both tasks.      
### 24.Human Performance Capture from Monocular Video in the Wild  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14672.pdf)
>  Capturing the dynamically deforming 3D shape of clothed human is essential for numerous applications, including VR/AR, autonomous driving, and human-computer interaction. Existing methods either require a highly specialized capturing setup, such as expensive multi-view imaging systems, or they lack robustness to challenging body poses. In this work, we propose a method capable of capturing the dynamic 3D human shape from a monocular video featuring challenging body poses, without any additional input. We first build a 3D template human model of the subject based on a learned regression model. We then track this template model's deformation under challenging body articulations based on 2D image observations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on an in-the-wild human video dataset 3DPW. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy in robustness and generalizability on videos from iPER datasets.      
### 25.diffConv: Analyzing Irregular Point Clouds with an Irregular View  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14658.pdf)
>  Standard spatial convolutions assume input data with a regular neighborhood structure. Existing methods typically generalize convolution to the irregular point cloud domain by fixing a regular "view" through e.g. a fixed neighborhood size, where the convolution kernel size remains the same for each point. However, since point clouds are not as structured as images, the fixed neighbor number gives an unfortunate inductive bias. We present a novel graph convolution named Difference Graph Convolution (diffConv), which does not rely on a regular view. diffConv operates on spatially-varying and density-dilated neighborhoods, which are further adapted by a learned masked attention mechanism. We validate our model on the ModelNet40 point cloud classification benchmark, obtaining state-of-the-art performance and far more robustness to noise, along with a much faster inference speed.      
### 26.Buildings Classification using Very High Resolution Satellite Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14650.pdf)
>  Buildings classification using satellite images is becoming more important for several applications such as damage assessment, resource allocation, and population estimation. We focus, in this work, on buildings damage assessment (BDA) and buildings type classification (BTC) of residential and non-residential buildings. We propose to rely solely on RGB satellite images and follow a 2-stage deep learning-based approach, where first, buildings' footprints are extracted using a semantic segmentation model, followed by classification of the cropped images. Due to the lack of an appropriate dataset for the residential/non-residential building classification, we introduce a new dataset of high-resolution satellite images. We conduct extensive experiments to select the best hyper-parameters, model architecture, and training paradigm, and we propose a new transfer learning-based approach that outperforms classical methods. Finally, we validate the proposed approach on two applications showing excellent accuracy and F1-score metrics.      
### 27.MUNet: Motion Uncertainty-aware Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14646.pdf)
>  The task of semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) has been greatly advanced and state-of-the-art performance has been made by dense matching-based methods. The recent methods leverage space-time memory (STM) networks and learn to retrieve relevant information from all available sources, where the past frames with object masks form an external memory and the current frame as the query is segmented using the mask information in the memory. However, when forming the memory and performing matching, these methods only exploit the appearance information while ignoring the motion information. In this paper, we advocate the return of the \emph{motion information} and propose a motion uncertainty-aware framework (MUNet) for semi-supervised VOS. First, we propose an implicit method to learn the spatial correspondences between neighboring frames, building upon a correlation cost volume. To handle the challenging cases of occlusion and textureless regions during constructing dense correspondences, we incorporate the uncertainty in dense matching and achieve motion uncertainty-aware feature representation. Second, we introduce a motion-aware spatial attention module to effectively fuse the motion feature with the semantic feature. Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that \textbf{\textit{using a small amount of data and combining it with powerful motion information can bring a significant performance boost}}. We achieve ${76.5\%}$ $\mathcal{J} \&amp; \mathcal{F}$ only using DAVIS17 for training, which significantly outperforms the \textit{SOTA} methods under the low-data protocol. \textit{The code will be released.}      
### 28.Urban Radiance Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14643.pdf)
>  The goal of this work is to perform 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis from data captured by scanning platforms commonly deployed for world mapping in urban outdoor environments (e.g., Street View). Given a sequence of posed RGB images and lidar sweeps acquired by cameras and scanners moving through an outdoor scene, we produce a model from which 3D surfaces can be extracted and novel RGB images can be synthesized. Our approach extends Neural Radiance Fields, which has been demonstrated to synthesize realistic novel images for small scenes in controlled settings, with new methods for leveraging asynchronously captured lidar data, for addressing exposure variation between captured images, and for leveraging predicted image segmentations to supervise densities on rays pointing at the sky. Each of these three extensions provides significant performance improvements in experiments on Street View data. Our system produces state-of-the-art 3D surface reconstructions and synthesizes higher quality novel views in comparison to both traditional methods (e.g.~COLMAP) and recent neural representations (e.g.~Mip-NeRF).      
### 29.iLabel: Interactive Neural Scene Labelling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14637.pdf)
>  Joint representation of geometry, colour and semantics using a 3D neural field enables accurate dense labelling from ultra-sparse interactions as a user reconstructs a scene in real-time using a handheld RGB-D sensor. Our iLabel system requires no training data, yet can densely label scenes more accurately than standard methods trained on large, expensively labelled image datasets. Furthermore, it works in an 'open set' manner, with semantic classes defined on the fly by the user. <br>iLabel's underlying model is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained from scratch in real-time to learn a joint neural scene representation. The scene model is updated and visualised in real-time, allowing the user to focus interactions to achieve efficient labelling. A room or similar scene can be accurately labelled into 10+ semantic categories with only a few tens of clicks. Quantitative labelling accuracy scales powerfully with the number of clicks, and rapidly surpasses standard pre-trained semantic segmentation methods. We also demonstrate a hierarchical labelling variant.      
### 30.Weakly-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks for medical image classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14605.pdf)
>  Weakly-supervised learning has become a popular technology in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel medical image classification algorithm, called Weakly-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (WSGAN), which only uses a small number of real images without labels to generate fake images or mask images to enlarge the sample size of the training set. First, we combine with MixMatch to generate pseudo labels for the fake images and unlabeled images to do the classification. Second, contrastive learning and self-attention mechanism are introduced into the proposed problem to enhance the classification accuracy. Third, the problem of mode collapse is well addressed by cyclic consistency loss. Finally, we design global and local classifiers to complement each other with the key information needed for classification. The experimental results on four medical image datasets show that WSGAN can obtain relatively high learning performance by using few labeled and unlabeled data. For example, the classification accuracy of WSGAN is 11% higher than that of the second-ranked MIXMATCH with 100 labeled images and 1000 unlabeled images on the OCT dataset. In addition, we also conduct ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.      
### 31.TransMVSNet: Global Context-aware Multi-view Stereo Network with Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14600.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present TransMVSNet, based on our exploration of feature matching in multi-view stereo (MVS). We analogize MVS back to its nature of a feature matching task and therefore propose a powerful Feature Matching Transformer (FMT) to leverage intra- (self-) and inter- (cross-) attention to aggregate long-range context information within and across images. To facilitate a better adaptation of the FMT, we leverage an Adaptive Receptive Field (ARF) module to ensure a smooth transit in scopes of features and bridge different stages with a feature pathway to pass transformed features and gradients across different scales. In addition, we apply pair-wise feature correlation to measure similarity between features, and adopt ambiguity-reducing focal loss to strengthen the supervision. To the best of our knowledge, TransMVSNet is the first attempt to leverage Transformer into the task of MVS. As a result, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU dataset, Tanks and Temples benchmark, and BlendedMVS dataset. The code of our method will be made available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/MegviiRobot/TransMVSNet" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> .      
### 32.Overcoming the Domain Gap in Contrastive Learning of Neural Action Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14595.pdf)
>  A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand the relationship between neural activity and behavior. For example, the ability to extract behavioral intentions from neural data, or neural decoding, is critical for developing effective brain machine interfaces. Although simple linear models have been applied to this challenge, they cannot identify important non-linear relationships. Thus, a self-supervised means of identifying non-linear relationships between neural dynamics and behavior, in order to compute neural representations, remains an important open problem. To address this challenge, we generated a new multimodal dataset consisting of the spontaneous behaviors generated by fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster -- a popular model organism in neuroscience research. The dataset includes 3D markerless motion capture data from six camera views of the animal generating spontaneous actions, as well as synchronously acquired two-photon microscope images capturing the activity of descending neuron populations that are thought to drive actions. Standard contrastive learning and unsupervised domain adaptation techniques struggle to learn neural action representations (embeddings computed from the neural data describing action labels) due to large inter-animal differences in both neural and behavioral modalities. To overcome this deficiency, we developed simple yet effective augmentations that close the inter-animal domain gap, allowing us to extract behaviorally relevant, yet domain agnostic, information from neural data. This multimodal dataset and our new set of augmentations promise to accelerate the application of self-supervised learning methods in neuroscience.      
### 33.Similarity Contrastive Estimation for Self-Supervised Soft Contrastive Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14585.pdf)
>  Contrastive representation learning has proven to be an effective self-supervised learning method. Most successful approaches are based on the Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) paradigm and consider different views of an instance as positives and other instances as noise that positives should be contrasted with. However, all instances in a dataset are drawn from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information that should not be considered as noise. We argue that a good data representation contains the relations, or semantic similarity, between the instances. Contrastive learning implicitly learns relations but considers the negatives as noise which is harmful to the quality of the learned relations and therefore the quality of the representation. To circumvent this issue we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive Estimation (SCE). Our training objective can be considered as soft contrastive learning. Instead of hard classifying positives and negatives, we propose a continuous distribution to push or pull instances based on their semantic similarities. The target similarity distribution is computed from weak augmented instances and sharpened to eliminate irrelevant relations. Each weak augmented instance is paired with a strong augmented instance that contrasts its positive while maintaining the target similarity distribution. Experimental results show that our proposed SCE outperforms its baselines MoCov2 and ReSSL on various datasets and is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on the ImageNet linear evaluation protocol.      
### 34.Multi-instance Point Cloud Registration by Efficient Correspondence Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14582.pdf)
>  We address the problem of estimating the poses of multiple instances of the source point cloud within a target point cloud. Existing solutions require sampling a lot of hypotheses to detect possible instances and reject the outliers, whose robustness and efficiency degrade notably when the number of instances and outliers increase. We propose to directly group the set of noisy correspondences into different clusters based on a distance invariance matrix. The instances and outliers are automatically identified through clustering. Our method is robust and fast. We evaluated our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our approach can correctly register up to 20 instances with an F1 score of 90.46% in the presence of 70% outliers, which performs significantly better and at least 10x faster than existing methods      
### 35.Recurrent Vision Transformer for Solving Visual Reasoning Problems  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14576.pdf)
>  Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) showed remarkable results in many vision tasks, they are still strained by simple yet challenging visual reasoning problems. Inspired by the recent success of the Transformer network in computer vision, in this paper, we introduce the Recurrent Vision Transformer (RViT) model. Thanks to the impact of recurrent connections and spatial attention in reasoning tasks, this network achieves competitive results on the same-different visual reasoning problems from the SVRT dataset. The weight-sharing both in spatial and depth dimensions regularizes the model, allowing it to learn using far fewer free parameters, using only 28k training samples. A comprehensive ablation study confirms the importance of a hybrid CNN + Transformer architecture and the role of the feedback connections, which iteratively refine the internal representation until a stable prediction is obtained. In the end, this study can lay the basis for a deeper understanding of the role of attention and recurrent connections for solving visual abstract reasoning tasks.      
### 36.MedRDF: A Robust and Retrain-Less Diagnostic Framework for Medical Pretrained Models Against Adversarial Attack  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14564.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks are discovered to be non-robust when attacked by imperceptible adversarial examples, which is dangerous for it applied into medical diagnostic system that requires high reliability. However, the defense methods that have good effect in natural images may not be suitable for medical diagnostic tasks. The preprocessing methods (e.g., random resizing, compression) may lead to the loss of the small lesions feature in the medical image. Retraining the network on the augmented data set is also not practical for medical models that have already been deployed online. Accordingly, it is necessary to design an easy-to-deploy and effective defense framework for medical diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a Robust and Retrain-Less Diagnostic Framework for Medical pretrained models against adversarial attack (i.e., MedRDF). It acts on the inference time of the pertained medical model. Specifically, for each test image, MedRDF firstly creates a large number of noisy copies of it, and obtains the output labels of these copies from the pretrained medical diagnostic model. Then, based on the labels of these copies, MedRDF outputs the final robust diagnostic result by majority voting. In addition to the diagnostic result, MedRDF produces the Robust Metric (RM) as the confidence of the result. Therefore, it is convenient and reliable to utilize MedRDF to convert pre-trained non-robust diagnostic models into robust ones. The experimental results on COVID-19 and DermaMNIST datasets verify the effectiveness of our MedRDF in improving the robustness of medical diagnostic models.      
### 37.Instance-wise Occlusion and Depth Orders in Natural Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14562.pdf)
>  In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, named InstaOrder, that can be used to understand the spatial relationships of instances in a 3D space. The dataset consists of 2.9M annotations of geometric orderings for class-labeled instances in 101K natural scenes. The scenes were annotated by 3,659 crowd-workers regarding (1) occlusion order that identifies occluder/occludee and (2) depth order that describes ordinal relations that consider relative distance from the camera. The dataset provides joint annotation of two kinds of orderings for the same instances, and we discover that the occlusion order and depth order are complementary. We also introduce a geometric order prediction network called InstaOrderNet, which is superior to state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we propose InstaDepthNet that uses auxiliary geometric order loss to boost the instance-wise depth prediction accuracy of MiDaS. These contributions to geometric scene understanding will help to improve the accuracy of various computer vision tasks.      
### 38.Image Segmentation to Identify Safe Landing Zones for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14557.pdf)
>  There is a marked increase in delivery services in urban areas, and with Jeff Bezos claiming that 86% of the orders that Amazon ships weigh less than 5 lbs, the time is ripe for investigation into economical methods of automating the final stage of the delivery process. With the advent of semi-autonomous drone delivery services, such as Irish startup `Manna', and Malta's `Skymax', the final step of the delivery journey remains the most difficult to automate. This paper investigates the use of simple images captured by a single RGB camera on a UAV to distinguish between safe and unsafe landing zones. We investigate semantic image segmentation frameworks as a way to identify safe landing zones and demonstrate the accuracy of lightweight models that minimise the number of sensors needed. By working with images rather than video we reduce the amount of energy needed to identify safe landing zones for a drone, without the need for human intervention.      
### 39.On the Integration of Self-Attention and Convolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14556.pdf)
>  Convolution and self-attention are two powerful techniques for representation learning, and they are usually considered as two peer approaches that are distinct from each other. In this paper, we show that there exists a strong underlying relation between them, in the sense that the bulk of computations of these two paradigms are in fact done with the same operation. Specifically, we first show that a traditional convolution with kernel size k x k can be decomposed into k^2 individual 1x1 convolutions, followed by shift and summation operations. Then, we interpret the projections of queries, keys, and values in self-attention module as multiple 1x1 convolutions, followed by the computation of attention weights and aggregation of the values. Therefore, the first stage of both two modules comprises the similar operation. More importantly, the first stage contributes a dominant computation complexity (square of the channel size) comparing to the second stage. This observation naturally leads to an elegant integration of these two seemingly distinct paradigms, i.e., a mixed model that enjoys the benefit of both self-Attention and Convolution (ACmix), while having minimum computational overhead compared to the pure convolution or self-attention counterpart. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves consistently improved results over competitive baselines on image recognition and downstream tasks. Code and pre-trained models will be released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Panxuran/ACmix" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> and <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://gitee.com/mindspore/models" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 40.MeshUDF: Fast and Differentiable Meshing of Unsigned Distance Field Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14549.pdf)
>  Recent work modelling 3D open surfaces train deep neural networks to approximate Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) and implicitly represent shapes. To convert this representation to an explicit mesh, they either use computationally expensive methods to mesh a dense point cloud sampling of the surface, or distort the surface by inflating it into a Signed Distance Field (SDF). <br>By contrast, we propose to directly mesh deep UDFs as open surfaces with an extension of marching cubes, by locally detecting surface crossings. Our method is order of magnitude faster than meshing a dense point cloud, and more accurate than inflating open surfaces. Moreover, we make our surface extraction differentiable, and show it can help fit sparse supervision signals.      
### 41.LiVLR: A Lightweight Visual-Linguistic Reasoning Framework for Video Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14547.pdf)
>  Video Question Answering (VideoQA), aiming to correctly answer the given question based on understanding multi-modal video content, is challenging due to the rich video content. From the perspective of video understanding, a good VideoQA framework needs to understand the video content at different semantic levels and flexibly integrate the diverse video content to distill question-related content. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Visual-Linguistic Reasoning framework named LiVLR. Specifically, LiVLR first utilizes the graph-based Visual and Linguistic Encoders to obtain multi-grained visual and linguistic representations. Subsequently, the obtained representations are integrated with the devised Diversity-aware Visual-Linguistic Reasoning module (DaVL). The DaVL considers the difference between the different types of representations and can flexibly adjust the importance of different types of representations when generating the question-related joint representation, which is an effective and general representation integration method. The proposed LiVLR is lightweight and shows its performance advantage on two VideoQA benchmarks, MRSVTT-QA and KnowIT VQA. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of LiVLR key components.      
### 42.Robust and Accurate Superquadric Recovery: a Probabilistic Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14517.pdf)
>  Interpreting objects with basic geometric primitives has long been studied in computer vision. Among geometric primitives, superquadrics are well known for their simple implicit expressions and capability of representing a wide range of shapes with few parameters. However, as the first and foremost step, recovering superquadrics accurately and robustly from 3D data still remains challenging. The existing methods are subject to local optima and are sensitive to noise and outliers in real-world scenarios, resulting in frequent failure in capturing geometric shapes. In this paper, we propose the first probabilistic method to recover superquadrics from point clouds. Our method builds a Gaussian-uniform mixture model (GUM) on the parametric surface of a superquadric, which explicitly models the generation of outliers and noise. The superquadric recovery is formulated as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem. We propose an algorithm, Expectation, Maximization, and Switching (EMS), to solve this problem, where: (1) outliers are predicted from the posterior perspective; (2) the superquadric parameter is optimized by the trust-region reflective algorithm; and (3) local optima are avoided by globally searching and switching among parameters encoding similar superquadrics. We show that our method can be extended to the multi-superquadrics recovery for complex objects. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Codes will be released.      
### 43.SPIN: Simplifying Polar Invariance for Neural networks Application to vision-based irradiance forecasting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14507.pdf)
>  Translational invariance induced by pooling operations is an inherent property of convolutional neural networks, which facilitates numerous computer vision tasks such as classification. Yet to leverage rotational invariant tasks, convolutional architectures require specific rotational invariant layers or extensive data augmentation to learn from diverse rotated versions of a given spatial configuration. Unwrapping the image into its polar coordinates provides a more explicit representation to train a convolutional architecture as the rotational invariance becomes translational, hence the visually distinct but otherwise equivalent rotated versions of a given scene can be learnt from a single image. We show with two common vision-based solar irradiance forecasting challenges (i.e. using ground-taken sky images or satellite images), that this preprocessing step significantly improves prediction results by standardising the scene representation, while decreasing training time by a factor of 4 compared to augmenting data with rotations. In addition, this transformation magnifies the area surrounding the centre of the rotation, leading to more accurate short-term irradiance predictions.      
### 44.On the Effectiveness of Neural Ensembles for Image Classification with Small Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14493.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks represent the gold standard for image classification. However, they usually need large amounts of data to reach superior performance. In this work, we focus on image classification problems with a few labeled examples per class and improve data efficiency by using an ensemble of relatively small networks. For the first time, our work broadly studies the existing concept of neural ensembling in domains with small data, through extensive validation using popular datasets and architectures. We compare ensembles of networks to their deeper or wider single competitors given a total fixed computational budget. We show that ensembling relatively shallow networks is a simple yet effective technique that is generally better than current state-of-the-art approaches for learning from small datasets. Finally, we present our interpretation according to which neural ensembles are more sample efficient because they learn simpler functions.      
### 45.CoNIC: Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting Challenge 2022  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14485.pdf)
>  Nuclear segmentation, classification and quantification within Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin stained histology images enables the extraction of interpretable cell-based features that can be used in downstream explainable models in computational pathology (CPath). However, automatic recognition of different nuclei is faced with a major challenge in that there are several different types of nuclei, some of them exhibiting large intra-class variability. To help drive forward research and innovation for automatic nuclei recognition in CPath, we organise the Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting (CoNIC) Challenge. The challenge encourages researchers to develop algorithms that perform segmentation, classification and counting of nuclei within the current largest known publicly available nuclei-level dataset in CPath, containing around half a million labelled nuclei. Therefore, the CoNIC challenge utilises over 10 times the number of nuclei as the previous largest challenge dataset for nuclei recognition. It is important for algorithms to be robust to input variation if we wish to deploy them in a clinical setting. Therefore, as part of this challenge we will also test the sensitivity of each submitted algorithm to certain input variations.      
### 46.High Quality Segmentation for Ultra High-resolution Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14482.pdf)
>  To segment 4K or 6K ultra high-resolution images needs extra computation consideration in image segmentation. Common strategies, such as down-sampling, patch cropping, and cascade model, cannot address well the balance issue between accuracy and computation cost. Motivated by the fact that humans distinguish among objects continuously from coarse to precise levels, we propose the Continuous Refinement Model~(CRM) for the ultra high-resolution segmentation refinement task. CRM continuously aligns the feature map with the refinement target and aggregates features to reconstruct these images' details. Besides, our CRM shows its significant generalization ability to fill the resolution gap between low-resolution training images and ultra high-resolution testing ones. We present quantitative performance evaluation and visualization to show that our proposed method is fast and effective on image segmentation refinement. Code will be released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/dvlab-research/Entity" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 47.Motion-from-Blur: 3D Shape and Motion Estimation of Motion-blurred Objects in Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14465.pdf)
>  We propose a method for jointly estimating the 3D motion, 3D shape, and appearance of highly motion-blurred objects from a video. To this end, we model the blurred appearance of a fast moving object in a generative fashion by parametrizing its 3D position, rotation, velocity, acceleration, bounces, shape, and texture over the duration of a predefined time window spanning multiple frames. Using differentiable rendering, we are able to estimate all parameters by minimizing the pixel-wise reprojection error to the input video via backpropagating through a rendering pipeline that accounts for motion blur by averaging the graphics output over short time intervals. For that purpose, we also estimate the camera exposure gap time within the same optimization. To account for abrupt motion changes like bounces, we model the motion trajectory as a piece-wise polynomial, and we are able to estimate the specific time of the bounce at sub-frame accuracy. Experiments on established benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods for fast moving object deblurring and 3D reconstruction.      
### 48.Decoupled Low-light Image Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14458.pdf)
>  The visual quality of photographs taken under imperfect lightness conditions can be degenerated by multiple factors, e.g., low lightness, imaging noise, color distortion and so on. Current low-light image enhancement models focus on the improvement of low lightness only, or simply deal with all the degeneration factors as a whole, therefore leading to a sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to decouple the enhancement model into two sequential stages. The first stage focuses on improving the scene visibility based on a pixel-wise non-linear mapping. The second stage focuses on improving the appearance fidelity by suppressing the rest degeneration factors. The decoupled model facilitates the enhancement in two aspects. On the one hand, the whole low-light enhancement can be divided into two easier subtasks. The first one only aims to enhance the visibility. It also helps to bridge the large intensity gap between the low-light and normal-light images. In this way, the second subtask can be shaped as the local appearance adjustment. On the other hand, since the parameter matrix learned from the first stage is aware of the lightness distribution and the scene structure, it can be incorporated into the second stage as the complementary information. In the experiments, our model demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, compared with other low-light image enhancement models. In addition, the ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of our model in multiple aspects, such as model structure and loss function. The trained model is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/hanxuhfut/Decoupled-Low-light-Image-Enhancement" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 49.HDR-NeRF: High Dynamic Range Neural Radiance Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14451.pdf)
>  We present High Dynamic Range Neural Radiance Fields (HDR-NeRF) to recover an HDR radiance field from a set of low dynamic range (LDR) views with different exposures. Using the HDR-NeRF, we are able to generate both novel HDR views and novel LDR views under different exposures. The key to our method is to model the physical imaging process, which dictates that the radiance of a scene point transforms to a pixel value in the LDR image with two implicit functions: a radiance field and a tone mapper. The radiance field encodes the scene radiance (values vary from 0 to +infty), which outputs the density and radiance of a ray by giving corresponding ray origin and ray direction. The tone mapper models the mapping process that a ray hitting on the camera sensor becomes a pixel value. The color of the ray is predicted by feeding the radiance and the corresponding exposure time into the tone mapper. We use the classic volume rendering technique to project the output radiance, colors, and densities into HDR and LDR images, while only the input LDR images are used as the supervision. We collect a new forward-facing HDR dataset to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world scenes validate that our method can not only accurately control the exposures of synthesized views but also render views with a high dynamic range.      
### 50.AVA-AVD: Audio-visual Speaker Diarization in the Wild  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14448.pdf)
>  Audio-visual speaker diarization aims at detecting ``who spoken when`` using both auditory and visual signals. Existing audio-visual diarization datasets are mainly focused on indoor environments like meeting rooms or news studios, which are quite different from in-the-wild videos in many scenarios such as movies, documentaries, and audience sitcoms. To create a testbed that can effectively compare diarization methods on videos in the wild, we annotate the speaker diarization labels on the AVA movie dataset and create a new benchmark called AVA-AVD. This benchmark is challenging due to the diverse scenes, complicated acoustic conditions, and completely off-screen speakers. Yet, how to deal with off-screen and on-screen speakers together still remains a critical challenge. To overcome it, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Relation Network (AVR-Net) which introduces an effective modality mask to capture discriminative information based on visibility. Experiments have shown that our method not only can outperform state-of-the-art methods but also is more robust as varying the ratio of off-screen speakers. Ablation studies demonstrate the advantages of the proposed AVR-Net and especially the modality mask on diarization. Our data and code will be made publicly available.      
### 51.Zero-Shot Image-to-Text Generation for Visual-Semantic Arithmetic  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14447.pdf)
>  Recent text-to-image matching models apply contrastive learning to large corpora of uncurated pairs of images and sentences. While such models can provide a powerful score for matching and subsequent zero-shot tasks, they are not capable of generating caption given an image. In this work, we repurpose such models to generate a descriptive text given an image at inference time, without any further training or tuning step. This is done by combining the visual-semantic model with a large language model, benefiting from the knowledge in both web-scale models. The resulting captions are much less restrictive than those obtained by supervised captioning methods. Moreover, as a zero-shot learning method, it is extremely flexible and we demonstrate its ability to perform image arithmetic in which the inputs can be either images or text and the output is a sentence. This enables novel high-level vision capabilities such as comparing two images or solving visual analogy tests.      
### 52.K-nearest neighbour and dynamic time warping for online signature verification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14438.pdf)
>  Online signatures are one of the most commonly used biometrics. Several verification systems and public databases were presented in this field. This paper presents a combination of k-nearest neighbor and dynamic time warping algorithms as a verification system using the recently published DeepSignDB database. Our algorithm was applied on both finger and stylus input signatures which represent both office and mobile scenarios. The system was first tested on the development set of the database. It achieved an error rate of 6.04% for the stylus input signatures, 5.20% for the finger input signatures, and 6.00% for a combination of both types. The system was also applied to the evaluation set of the database and achieved very promising results, especially for finger input signatures.      
### 53.Agent-Centric Relation Graph for Object Visual Navigation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14422.pdf)
>  Object visual navigation aims to steer an agent towards a target object based on visual observations of the agent. It is highly desirable to reasonably perceive the environment and accurately control the agent. In the navigation task, we introduce an Agent-Centric Relation Graph (ACRG) for learning the visual representation based on the relationships in the environment. ACRG is a highly effective and reasonable structure that consists of two relationships, i.e., the relationship among objects and the relationship between the agent and the target. On the one hand, we design the Object Horizontal Relationship Graph (OHRG) that stores the relative horizontal location among objects. Note that the vertical relationship is not involved in OHRG, and we argue that OHRG is suitable for the control strategy. On the other hand, we propose the Agent-Target Depth Relationship Graph (ATDRG) that enables the agent to perceive the distance to the target. To achieve ATDRG, we utilize image depth to represent the distance. Given the above relationships, the agent can perceive the environment and output navigation actions. Given the visual representations constructed by ACRG and position-encoded global features, the agent can capture the target position to perform navigation actions. Experimental results in the artificial environment AI2-Thor demonstrate that ACRG significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in unseen testing environments.      
### 54.IB-MVS: An Iterative Algorithm for Deep Multi-View Stereo based on Binary Decisions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14420.pdf)
>  We present a novel deep-learning-based method for Multi-View Stereo. Our method estimates high resolution and highly precise depth maps iteratively, by traversing the continuous space of feasible depth values at each pixel in a binary decision fashion. The decision process leverages a deep-network architecture: this computes a pixelwise binary mask that establishes whether each pixel actual depth is in front or behind its current iteration individual depth hypothesis. Moreover, in order to handle occluded regions, at each iteration the results from different source images are fused using pixelwise weights estimated by a second network. Thanks to the adopted binary decision strategy, which permits an efficient exploration of the depth space, our method can handle high resolution images without trading resolution and precision. This sets it apart from most alternative learning-based Multi-View Stereo methods, where the explicit discretization of the depth space requires the processing of large cost volumes. We compare our method with state-of-the-art Multi-View Stereo methods on the DTU, Tanks and Temples and the challenging ETH3D benchmarks and show competitive results.      
### 55.PGGANet: Pose Guided Graph Attention Network for Person Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14411.pdf)
>  Person re-identification (ReID) aims at retrieving a person from images captured by different cameras. For deep-learning-based ReID methods, it has been proved that using local features together with global feature of person image could help to give robust feature representations for person retrieval. Human pose information could provide the locations of human skeleton to effectively guide the network to pay more attention on these key areas and could also help to reduce the noise distractions from background or occlusions. However, methods proposed by previous pose-related works might not be able to fully exploit the benefits of pose information and did not take into consideration the different contributions of different local features. In this paper, we propose a pose guided graph attention network, a multi-branch architecture consisting of one branch for global feature, one branch for mid-granular body features and one branch for fine-granular key point features. We use a pre-trained pose estimator to generate the key-point heatmap for local feature learning and carefully design a graph attention convolution layer to re-evaluate the contribution weights of extracted local features by modeling the similarities relations. Experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on discriminative feature learning and we show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on several mainstream evaluation datasets. We also conduct a plenty of ablation studies and design different kinds of comparison experiments for our network to prove its effectiveness and robustness, including holistic datasets, partial datasets, occluded datasets and cross-domain tests.      
### 56.Lightweight Deep Learning Architecture for MPI Correction and Transient Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14396.pdf)
>  Indirect Time-of-Flight cameras (iToF) are low-cost devices that provide depth images at an interactive frame rate. However, they are affected by different error sources, with the spotlight taken by Multi-Path Interference (MPI), a key challenge for this technology. Common data-driven approaches tend to focus on a direct estimation of the output depth values, ignoring the underlying transient propagation of the light in the scene. In this work instead, we propose a very compact architecture, leveraging on the direct-global subdivision of transient information for the removal of MPI and for the reconstruction of the transient information itself. The proposed model reaches state-of-the-art MPI correction performances both on synthetic and real data and proves to be very competitive also at extreme levels of noise; at the same time, it also makes a step towards reconstructing transient information from multi-frequency iToF data.      
### 57.VPFNet: Improving 3D Object Detection with Virtual Point based LiDAR and Stereo Data Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14382.pdf)
>  It has been well recognized that fusing the complementary information from depth-aware LiDAR point clouds and semantic-rich stereo images would benefit 3D object detection. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to explore the inherently unnatural interaction between sparse 3D points and dense 2D pixels. To ease this difficulty, the recent proposals generally project the 3D points onto the 2D image plane to sample the image data and then aggregate the data at the points. However, this approach often suffers from the mismatch between the resolution of point clouds and RGB images, leading to sub-optimal performance. Specifically, taking the sparse points as the multi-modal data aggregation locations causes severe information loss for high-resolution images, which in turn undermines the effectiveness of multi-sensor fusion. In this paper, we present VPFNet -- a new architecture that cleverly aligns and aggregates the point cloud and image data at the `virtual' points. Particularly, with their density lying between that of the 3D points and 2D pixels, the virtual points can nicely bridge the resolution gap between the two sensors, and thus preserve more information for processing. Moreover, we also investigate the data augmentation techniques that can be applied to both point clouds and RGB images, as the data augmentation has made non-negligible contribution towards 3D object detectors to date. We have conducted extensive experiments on KITTI dataset, and have observed good performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, our VPFNet achieves 83.21\% moderate 3D AP and 91.86\% moderate BEV AP on the KITTI test set, ranking the 1st since May 21th, 2021. The network design also takes computation efficiency into consideration -- we can achieve a FPS of 15 on a single NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti GPU. The code will be made available for reproduction and further investigation.      
### 58.IDR: Self-Supervised Image Denoising via Iterative Data Refinement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14358.pdf)
>  The lack of large-scale noisy-clean image pairs restricts supervised denoising methods' deployment in actual applications. While existing unsupervised methods are able to learn image denoising without ground-truth clean images, they either show poor performance or work under impractical settings (e.g., paired noisy images). In this paper, we present a practical unsupervised image denoising method to achieve state-of-the-art denoising performance. Our method only requires single noisy images and a noise model, which is easily accessible in practical raw image denoising. It performs two steps iteratively: (1) Constructing a noisier-noisy dataset with random noise from the noise model; (2) training a model on the noisier-noisy dataset and using the trained model to refine noisy images to obtain the targets used in the next round. We further approximate our full iterative method with a fast algorithm for more efficient training while keeping its original high performance. Experiments on real-world, synthetic, and correlated noise show that our proposed unsupervised denoising approach has superior performances over existing unsupervised methods and competitive performance with supervised methods. In addition, we argue that existing denoising datasets are of low quality and contain only a small number of scenes. To evaluate raw image denoising performance in real-world applications, we build a high-quality raw image dataset SenseNoise-500 that contains 500 real-life scenes. The dataset can serve as a strong benchmark for better evaluating raw image denoising. Code and dataset will be released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/zhangyi-3/IDR" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 59.Improved Knowledge Distillation via Adversarial Collaboration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14356.pdf)
>  Knowledge distillation has become an important approach to obtain a compact yet effective model. To achieve this goal, a small student model is trained to exploit the knowledge of a large well-trained teacher model. However, due to the capacity gap between the teacher and the student, the student's performance is hard to reach the level of the teacher. Regarding this issue, existing methods propose to reduce the difficulty of the teacher's knowledge via a proxy way. We argue that these proxy-based methods overlook the knowledge loss of the teacher, which may cause the student to encounter capacity bottlenecks. In this paper, we alleviate the capacity gap problem from a new perspective with the purpose of averting knowledge loss. Instead of sacrificing part of the teacher's knowledge, we propose to build a more powerful student via adversarial collaborative learning. To this end, we further propose an Adversarial Collaborative Knowledge Distillation (ACKD) method that effectively improves the performance of knowledge distillation. Specifically, we construct the student model with multiple auxiliary learners. Meanwhile, we devise an adversarial collaborative module (ACM) that introduces attention mechanism and adversarial learning to enhance the capacity of the student. Extensive experiments on four classification tasks show the superiority of the proposed ACKD.      
### 60.Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation via Sample-to-Sample Self-Distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14353.pdf)
>  Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is to adapt a learner to a new domain with only a small set of labeled samples when a large labeled dataset is given on a source domain. In this paper, we propose a pair-based SSDA method that adapts a model to the target domain using self-distillation with sample pairs. Each sample pair is composed of a teacher sample from a labeled dataset (i.e., source or labeled target) and its student sample from an unlabeled dataset (i.e., unlabeled target). Our method generates an assistant feature by transferring an intermediate style between the teacher and the student, and then train the model by minimizing the output discrepancy between the student and the assistant. During training, the assistants gradually bridge the discrepancy between the two domains, thus allowing the student to easily learn from the teacher. Experimental evaluation on standard benchmarks shows that our method effectively minimizes both the inter-domain and intra-domain discrepancies, thus achieving significant improvements over recent methods.      
### 61.First Power Linear Unit with Sign  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14349.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a novel and insightful activation method termed FPLUS, which exploits mathematical power function with polar signs in form. It is enlightened by common inverse operation while endowed with an intuitive meaning of bionics. The formulation is derived theoretically under conditions of some prior knowledge and anticipative properties, and then its feasibility is verified through a series of experiments using typical benchmark datasets, whose results indicate our approach owns superior competitiveness among numerous activation functions, as well as compatible stability across many CNN architectures. Furthermore, we extend the function presented to a more generalized type called PFPLUS with two parameters that can be fixed or learnable, so as to augment its expressive capacity, and outcomes of identical tests validate this improvement.      
### 62.Anomaly-Aware Semantic Segmentation by Leveraging Synthetic-Unknown Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14343.pdf)
>  Anomaly awareness is an essential capability for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. While recent progress of robotics and computer vision has enabled anomaly detection for image classification, anomaly detection on semantic segmentation is less explored. Conventional anomaly-aware systems assuming other existing classes as out-of-distribution (pseudo-unknown) classes for training a model will result in two drawbacks. (1) Unknown classes, which applications need to cope with, might not actually exist during training time. (2) Model performance would strongly rely on the class selection. Observing this, we propose a novel Synthetic-Unknown Data Generation, intending to tackle the anomaly-aware semantic segmentation task. We design a new Masked Gradient Update (MGU) module to generate auxiliary data along the boundary of in-distribution data points. In addition, we modify the traditional cross-entropy loss to emphasize the border data points. We reach the state-of-the-art performance on two anomaly segmentation datasets. Ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed modules.      
### 63.ROBIN : A Benchmark for Robustness to Individual Nuisancesin Real-World Out-of-Distribution Shifts  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14341.pdf)
>  Enhancing the robustness in real-world scenarios has been proven very challenging. One reason is that existing robustness benchmarks are limited, as they either rely on synthetic data or they simply measure robustness as generalization between datasets and hence ignore the effects of individual nuisance factors. In this work, we introduce ROBIN, a benchmark dataset for diagnosing the robustness of vision algorithms to individual nuisances in real-world images. ROBIN builds on 10 rigid categories from the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ImageNet datasets and includes out-of-distribution examples of the objects 3D pose, shape, texture, context and weather conditions. ROBIN is richly annotated to enable benchmark models for image classification, object detection, and 3D pose estimation. We provide results for a number of popular baselines and make several interesting observations: 1. Some nuisance factors have a much stronger negative effect on the performance compared to others. Moreover, the negative effect of an OODnuisance depends on the downstream vision task. 2. Current approaches to enhance OOD robustness using strong data augmentation have only marginal effects in real-world OOD scenarios, and sometimes even reduce the OOD performance. 3. We do not observe any significant differences between convolutional and transformer architectures in terms of OOD robustness. We believe our dataset provides a rich testbed to study the OOD robustness of vision algorithms and will help to significantly push forward research in this area.      
### 64.Attention-based Feature Decomposition-Reconstruction Network for Scene Text Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14340.pdf)
>  Recently, scene text detection has been a challenging task. Texts with arbitrary shape or large aspect ratio are usually hard to detect. Previous segmentation-based methods can describe curve text more accurately but suffer from over segmentation and text adhesion. In this paper, we propose attention-based feature decomposition-reconstruction network for scene text detection, which utilizes contextual information and low-level feature to enhance the performance of segmentation-based text detector. In the phase of feature fusion, we introduce cross level attention module to enrich contextual information of text by adding attention mechanism on fused multi-scaled feature. In the phase of probability map generation, a feature decomposition-reconstruction module is proposed to alleviate the over segmentation problem of large aspect ratio text, which decomposes text feature according to their frequency characteristic and then reconstructs it by adding low-level feature. Experiments have been conducted on two public benchmark datasets and results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.      
### 65.Heterogeneous Visible-Thermal and Visible-Infrared Face Recognition using Unit-Class Loss and Cross-Modality Discriminator  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14339.pdf)
>  Visible-to-thermal face image matching is a challenging variate of cross-modality recognition. The challenge lies in the large modality gap and low correlation between visible and thermal modalities. Existing approaches employ image preprocessing, feature extraction, or common subspace projection, which are independent problems in themselves. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework for cross-modal face recognition. The proposed algorithm aims to learn identity-discriminative features from unprocessed facial images and identify cross-modal image pairs. A novel Unit-Class Loss is proposed for preserving identity information while discarding modality information. In addition, a Cross-Modality Discriminator block is proposed for integrating image-pair classification capability into the network. The proposed network can be used to extract modality-independent vector representations or a matching-pair classification for test images. Our cross-modality face recognition experiments on five independent databases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves marked improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.      
### 66.Improving Deep Learning Interpretability by Saliency Guided Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14338.pdf)
>  Saliency methods have been widely used to highlight important input features in model predictions. Most existing methods use backpropagation on a modified gradient function to generate saliency maps. Thus, noisy gradients can result in unfaithful feature attributions. In this paper, we tackle this issue and introduce a {\it saliency guided training}procedure for neural networks to reduce noisy gradients used in predictions while retaining the predictive performance of the model. Our saliency guided training procedure iteratively masks features with small and potentially noisy gradients while maximizing the similarity of model outputs for both masked and unmasked inputs. We apply the saliency guided training procedure to various synthetic and real data sets from computer vision, natural language processing, and time series across diverse neural architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Networks, and Transformers. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that saliency guided training procedure significantly improves model interpretability across various domains while preserving its predictive performance.      
### 67.Sparse DETR: Efficient End-to-End Object Detection with Learnable Sparsity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14330.pdf)
>  DETR is the first end-to-end object detector using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture and demonstrates competitive performance but low computational efficiency on high resolution feature maps. The subsequent work, Deformable DETR, enhances the efficiency of DETR by replacing dense attention with deformable attention, which achieves 10x faster convergence and improved performance. Deformable DETR uses the multiscale feature to ameliorate performance, however, the number of encoder tokens increases by 20x compared to DETR, and the computation cost of the encoder attention remains a bottleneck. In our preliminary experiment, we observe that the detection performance hardly deteriorates even if only a part of the encoder token is updated. Inspired by this observation, we propose Sparse DETR that selectively updates only the tokens expected to be referenced by the decoder, thus help the model effectively detect objects. In addition, we show that applying an auxiliary detection loss on the selected tokens in the encoder improves the performance while minimizing computational overhead. We validate that Sparse DETR achieves better performance than Deformable DETR even with only 10% encoder tokens on the COCO dataset. Albeit only the encoder tokens are sparsified, the total computation cost decreases by 38% and the frames per second (FPS) increases by 42% compared to Deformable DETR. <br>Code is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/kakaobrain/sparse-detr" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 68.TinyDefectNet: Highly Compact Deep Neural Network Architecture for High-Throughput Manufacturing Visual Quality Inspection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14319.pdf)
>  A critical aspect in the manufacturing process is the visual quality inspection of manufactured components for defects and flaws. Human-only visual inspection can be very time-consuming and laborious, and is a significant bottleneck especially for high-throughput manufacturing scenarios. Given significant advances in the field of deep learning, automated visual quality inspection can lead to highly efficient and reliable detection of defects and flaws during the manufacturing process. However, deep learning-driven visual inspection methods often necessitate significant computational resources, thus limiting throughput and act as a bottleneck to widespread adoption for enabling smart factories. In this study, we investigated the utilization of a machine-driven design exploration approach to create TinyDefectNet, a highly compact deep convolutional network architecture tailored for high-throughput manufacturing visual quality inspection. TinyDefectNet comprises of just ~427K parameters and has a computational complexity of ~97M FLOPs, yet achieving a detection accuracy of a state-of-the-art architecture for the task of surface defect detection on the NEU defect benchmark dataset. As such, TinyDefectNet can achieve the same level of detection performance at 52$\times$ lower architectural complexity and 11x lower computational complexity. Furthermore, TinyDefectNet was deployed on an AMD EPYC 7R32, and achieved 7.6x faster throughput using the native Tensorflow environment and 9x faster throughput using AMD ZenDNN accelerator library. Finally, explainability-driven performance validation strategy was conducted to ensure correct decision-making behaviour was exhibited by TinyDefectNet to improve trust in its usage by operators and inspectors.      
### 69.Learning Context-Aware Embedding for Person Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14316.pdf)
>  Person Search is a relevant task that aims to jointly solve Person Detection and Person Re-identification(re-ID). Though most previous methods focus on learning robust individual features for retrieval, it's still hard to distinguish confusing persons because of illumination, large pose variance, and occlusion. Contextual information is practically available in person search task which benefits searching in terms of reducing confusion. To this end, we present a novel contextual feature head named Attention Context-Aware Embedding(ACAE) which enhances contextual information. ACAE repeatedly reviews the person features within and across images to find similar pedestrian patterns, allowing it to implicitly learn to find possible co-travelers and efficiently model contextual relevant instances' relations. Moreover, we propose Image Memory Bank to improve the training efficiency. Experimentally, ACAE shows extensive promotion when built on different one-step methods. Our overall methods achieve state-of-the-art results compared with previous one-step methods.      
### 70.The CSIRO Crown-of-Thorn Starfish Detection Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14311.pdf)
>  Crown-of-Thorn Starfish (COTS) outbreaks are a major cause of coral loss on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and substantial surveillance and control programs are underway in an attempt to manage COTS populations to ecologically sustainable levels. We release a large-scale, annotated underwater image dataset from a COTS outbreak area on the GBR, to encourage research on Machine Learning and AI-driven technologies to improve the detection, monitoring, and management of COTS populations at reef scale. The dataset is released and hosted in a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning community with the task of COTS detection from these underwater images.      
### 71.Feature-Gate Coupling for Dynamic Network Pruning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14302.pdf)
>  Gating modules have been widely explored in dynamic network pruning to reduce the run-time computational cost of deep neural networks while preserving the representation of features. Despite the substantial progress, existing methods remain ignoring the consistency between feature and gate distributions, which may lead to distortion of gated features. In this paper, we propose a feature-gate coupling (FGC) approach aiming to align distributions of features and gates. FGC is a plug-and-play module, which consists of two steps carried out in an iterative self-supervised manner. In the first step, FGC utilizes the $k$-Nearest Neighbor method in the feature space to explore instance neighborhood relationships, which are treated as self-supervisory signals. In the second step, FGC exploits contrastive learning to regularize gating modules with generated self-supervisory signals, leading to the alignment of instance neighborhood relationships within the feature and gate spaces. Experimental results validate that the proposed FGC method improves the baseline approach with significant margins, outperforming the state-of-the-arts with better accuracy-computation trade-off. Code is publicly available.      
### 72.Data Augmentation For Medical MR Image Using Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14297.pdf)
>  Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) based on deep learning has become a crucial diagnostic technology in the medical industry, effectively improving diagnosis accuracy. However, the scarcity of brain tumor Magnetic Resonance (MR) image datasets causes the low performance of deep learning algorithms. The distribution of transformed images generated by traditional data augmentation (DA) intrinsically resembles the original ones, resulting in a limited performance in terms of generalization ability. This work improves Progressive Growing of GANs with a structural similarity loss function (PGGAN-SSIM) to solve image blurriness problems and model collapse. We also explore other GAN-based data augmentation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our results show that PGGAN-SSIM successfully generates 256x256 realistic brain tumor MR images which fill the real image distribution uncovered by the original dataset. Furthermore, PGGAN-SSIM exceeds other GAN-based methods, achieving promising performance improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM).      
### 73.Deblur-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from Blurry Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14292.pdf)
>  Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has gained considerable attention recently for 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis due to its remarkable synthesis quality. However, image blurriness caused by defocus or motion, which often occurs when capturing scenes in the wild, significantly degrades its reconstruction quality. To address this problem, We propose Deblur-NeRF, the first method that can recover a sharp NeRF from blurry input. We adopt an analysis-by-synthesis approach that reconstructs blurry views by simulating the blurring process, thus making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The core of this simulation is a novel Deformable Sparse Kernel (DSK) module that models spatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each spatial location. The ray origin of each kernel point is jointly optimized, inspired by the physical blurring process. This module is parameterized as an MLP that has the ability to be generalized to various blur types. Jointly optimizing the NeRF and the DSK module allows us to restore a sharp NeRF. We demonstrate that our method can be used on both camera motion blur and defocus blur: the two most common types of blur in real scenes. Evaluation results on both synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms several baselines. The synthetic and real datasets along with the source code will be made publicly available to facilitate future research.      
### 74.TAL: Two-stream Adaptive Learning for Generalizable Person Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14290.pdf)
>  Domain generalizable person re-identification aims to apply a trained model to unseen domains. Prior works either combine the data in all the training domains to capture domain-invariant features, or adopt a mixture of experts to investigate domain-specific information. In this work, we argue that both domain-specific and domain-invariant features are crucial for improving the generalization ability of re-id models. To this end, we design a novel framework, which we name two-stream adaptive learning (TAL), to simultaneously model these two kinds of information. Specifically, a domain-specific stream is proposed to capture training domain statistics with batch normalization (BN) parameters, while an adaptive matching layer is designed to dynamically aggregate domain-level information. In the meantime, we design an adaptive BN layer in the domain-invariant stream, to approximate the statistics of various unseen domains. These two streams work adaptively and collaboratively to learn generalizable re-id features. Our framework can be applied to both single-source and multi-source domain generalization tasks, where experimental results show that our framework notably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 75.ExCon: Explanation-driven Supervised Contrastive Learning for Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14271.pdf)
>  Contrastive learning has led to substantial improvements in the quality of learned embedding representations for tasks such as image classification. However, a key drawback of existing contrastive augmentation methods is that they may lead to the modification of the image content which can yield undesired alterations of its semantics. This can affect the performance of the model on downstream tasks. Hence, in this paper, we ask whether we can augment image data in contrastive learning such that the task-relevant semantic content of an image is preserved. For this purpose, we propose to leverage saliency-based explanation methods to create content-preserving masked augmentations for contrastive learning. Our novel explanation-driven supervised contrastive learning (ExCon) methodology critically serves the dual goals of encouraging nearby image embeddings to have similar content and explanation. To quantify the impact of ExCon, we conduct experiments on the CIFAR-100 and the Tiny ImageNet datasets. We demonstrate that ExCon outperforms vanilla supervised contrastive learning in terms of classification, explanation quality, adversarial robustness as well as calibration of probabilistic predictions of the model in the context of distributional shift.      
### 76.Automated Detection of Patients in Hospital Video Recordings  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14270.pdf)
>  In a clinical setting, epilepsy patients are monitored via video electroencephalogram (EEG) tests. A video EEG records what the patient experiences on videotape while an EEG device records their brainwaves. Currently, there are no existing automated methods for tracking the patient's location during a seizure, and video recordings of hospital patients are substantially different from publicly available video benchmark datasets. For example, the camera angle can be unusual, and patients can be partially covered with bedding sheets and electrode sets. Being able to track a patient in real-time with video EEG would be a promising innovation towards improving the quality of healthcare. Specifically, an automated patient detection system could supplement clinical oversight and reduce the resource-intensive efforts of nurses and doctors who need to continuously monitor patients. We evaluate an ImageNet pre-trained Mask R-CNN, a standard deep learning model for object detection, on the task of patient detection using our own curated dataset of 45 videos of hospital patients. The dataset was aggregated and curated for this work. We show that without fine-tuning, ImageNet pre-trained Mask R-CNN models perform poorly on such data. By fine-tuning the models with a subset of our dataset, we observe a substantial improvement in patient detection performance, with a mean average precision of 0.64. We show that the results vary substantially depending on the video clip.      
### 77.Explore the Potential Performance of Vision-and-Language Navigation Model: a Snapshot Ensemble Method  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14267.pdf)
>  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task in the field of artificial intelligence. Although massive progress has been made in this task over the past few years attributed to breakthroughs in deep vision and language models, it remains tough to build VLN models that can generalize as well as humans. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to improve VLN models. Based on our discovery that snapshots of the same VLN model behave significantly differently even when their success rates are relatively the same, we propose a snapshot-based ensemble solution that leverages predictions among multiple snapshots. Constructed on the snapshots of the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) model $\circlearrowright$BERT and our past-action-aware modification, our proposed ensemble achieves the new SOTA performance in the R2R dataset challenge in Navigation Error (NE) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).      
### 78.EffCNet: An Efficient CondenseNet for Image Classification on NXP BlueBox  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14243.pdf)
>  Intelligent edge devices with built-in processors vary widely in terms of capability and physical form to perform advanced Computer Vision (CV) tasks such as image classification and object detection, for example. With constant advances in the field of autonomous cars and UAVs, embedded systems and mobile devices, there has been an ever-growing demand for extremely efficient Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for real-time inference on these smart edge devices with constrained computational resources. With unreliable network connections in remote regions and an added complexity of data transmission, it is of an utmost importance to capture and process data locally instead of sending the data to cloud servers for remote processing. Edge devices on the other hand, offer limited processing power due to their inexpensive hardware, and limited cooling and computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture called EffCNet which is an improved and an efficient version of CondenseNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for edge devices utilizing self-querying data augmentation and depthwise separable convolutional strategies to improve real-time inference performance as well as reduce the final trained model size, trainable parameters, and Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) of EffCNet CNN. Furthermore, extensive supervised image classification analyses are conducted on two benchmarking datasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, to verify real-time inference performance of our proposed CNN. Finally, we deploy these trained weights on NXP BlueBox which is an intelligent edge development platform designed for self-driving vehicles and UAVs, and conclusions will be extrapolated accordingly.      
### 79.Make an Omelette with Breaking Eggs: Zero-Shot Learning for Novel Attribute Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14182.pdf)
>  Most of the existing algorithms for zero-shot classification problems typically rely on the attribute-based semantic relations among categories to realize the classification of novel categories without observing any of their instances. However, training the zero-shot classification models still requires attribute labeling for each class (or even instance) in the training dataset, which is also expensive. To this end, in this paper, we bring up a new problem scenario: "Are we able to derive zero-shot learning for novel attribute detectors/classifiers and use them to automatically annotate the dataset for labeling efficiency?" Basically, given only a small set of detectors that are learned to recognize some manually annotated attributes (i.e., the seen attributes), we aim to synthesize the detectors of novel attributes in a zero-shot learning manner. Our proposed method, Zero Shot Learning for Attributes (ZSLA), which is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge, tackles this new research problem by applying the set operations to first decompose the seen attributes into their basic attributes and then recombine these basic attributes into the novel ones. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the capacity of our synthesized detectors for accurately capturing the semantics of the novel attributes and show their superior performance in terms of detection and localization compared to other baseline approaches. Moreover, with using only 32 seen attributes on the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset, our proposed method is able to synthesize other 207 novel attributes, while various generalized zero-shot classification algorithms trained upon the dataset re-annotated by our synthesized attribute detectors are able to provide comparable performance with those trained with the manual ground-truth annotations.      
### 80.UAV-based Crowd Surveillance in Post COVID-19 Era  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14176.pdf)
>  To cope with the current pandemic situation and reinstate pseudo-normal daily life, several measures have been deployed and maintained, such as mask wearing, social distancing, hands sanitizing, etc. Since outdoor cultural events, concerts, and picnics, are gradually allowed, a close monitoring of the crowd activity is needed to avoid undesired contact and disease transmission. In this context, intelligent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be occasionally deployed to ensure the surveillance of these activities, that health restriction measures are applied, and to trigger alerts when the latter are not respected. Consequently, we propose in this paper a complete UAV framework for intelligent monitoring of post COVID-19 outdoor activities. Specifically, we propose a three steps approach. In the first step, captured images by a UAV are analyzed using machine learning to detect and locate individuals. The second step consists of a novel coordinates mapping approach to evaluate distances among individuals, then cluster them, while the third step provides an energy-efficient and/or reliable UAV trajectory to inspect clusters for restrictions violation such as mask wearing. Obtained results provide the following insights: 1) Efficient detection of individuals depends on the angle from which the image was captured, 2) coordinates mapping is very sensitive to the estimation error in individuals' bounding boxes, and 3) UAV trajectory design algorithm 2-Opt is recommended for practical real-time deployments due to its low-complexity and near-optimal performance.      
### 81.CDGNet: Class Distribution Guided Network for Human Parsing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14173.pdf)
>  The objective of human parsing is to partition a human in an image into constituent parts. This task involves labeling each pixel of the human image according to the classes. Since the human body comprises hierarchically structured parts, each body part of an image can have its sole position distribution characteristics. Probably, a human head is less likely to be under the feet, and arms are more likely to be near the torso. Inspired by this observation, we make instance class distributions by accumulating the original human parsing label in the horizontal and vertical directions, which can be utilized as supervision signals. Using these horizontal and vertical class distribution labels, the network is guided to exploit the intrinsic position distribution of each class. We combine two guided features to form a spatial guidance map, which is then superimposed onto the baseline network by multiplication and concatenation to distinguish the human parts precisely. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on three well-known benchmarks: LIP, ATR, and CIHP databases.      
### 82.Learning To Segment Dominant Object Motion From Watching Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14160.pdf)
>  Existing deep learning based unsupervised video object segmentation methods still rely on ground-truth segmentation masks to train. Unsupervised in this context only means that no annotated frames are used during inference. As obtaining ground-truth segmentation masks for real image scenes is a laborious task, we envision a simple framework for dominant moving object segmentation that neither requires annotated data to train nor relies on saliency priors or pre-trained optical flow maps. Inspired by a layered image representation, we introduce a technique to group pixel regions according to their affine parametric motion. This enables our network to learn segmentation of the dominant foreground object using only RGB image pairs as input for both training and inference. We establish a baseline for this novel task using a new MovingCars dataset and show competitive performance against recent methods that require annotated masks to train.      
### 83.Implicit Equivariance in Convolutional Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14157.pdf)
>  Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) are inherently equivariant under translations, however, they do not have an equivalent embedded mechanism to handle other transformations such as rotations and change in scale. Several approaches exist that make CNNs equivariant under other transformation groups by design. Among these, steerable CNNs have been especially effective. However, these approaches require redesigning standard networks with filters mapped from combinations of predefined basis involving complex analytical functions. We experimentally demonstrate that these restrictions in the choice of basis can lead to model weights that are sub-optimal for the primary deep learning task (e.g. classification). Moreover, such hard-baked explicit formulations make it difficult to design composite networks comprising heterogeneous feature groups. To circumvent such issues, we propose Implicitly Equivariant Networks (IEN) which induce equivariance in the different layers of a standard CNN model by optimizing a multi-objective loss function that combines the primary loss with an equivariance loss term. Through experiments with VGG and ResNet models on Rot-MNIST , Rot-TinyImageNet, Scale-MNIST and STL-10 datasets, we show that IEN, even with its simple formulation, performs better than steerable networks. Also, IEN facilitates construction of heterogeneous filter groups allowing reduction in number of channels in CNNs by a factor of over 30% while maintaining performance on par with baselines. The efficacy of IEN is further validated on the hard problem of visual object tracking. We show that IEN outperforms the state-of-the-art rotation equivariant tracking method while providing faster inference speed.      
### 84.FashionSearchNet-v2: Learning Attribute Representations with Localization for Image Retrieval with Attribute Manipulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14145.pdf)
>  The focus of this paper is on the problem of image retrieval with attribute manipulation. Our proposed work is able to manipulate the desired attributes of the query image while maintaining its other attributes. For example, the collar attribute of the query image can be changed from round to v-neck to retrieve similar images from a large dataset. A key challenge in e-commerce is that images have multiple attributes where users would like to manipulate and it is important to estimate discriminative feature representations for each of these attributes. The proposed FashionSearchNet-v2 architecture is able to learn attribute specific representations by leveraging on its weakly-supervised localization module, which ignores the unrelated features of attributes in the feature space, thus improving the similarity learning. The network is jointly trained with the combination of attribute classification and triplet ranking loss to estimate local representations. These local representations are then merged into a single global representation based on the instructed attribute manipulation where desired images can be retrieved with a distance metric. The proposed method also provides explainability for its retrieval process to help provide additional information on the attention of the network. Experiments performed on several datasets that are rich in terms of the number of attributes show that FashionSearchNet-v2 outperforms the other state-of-the-art attribute manipulation techniques. Different than our earlier work (FashionSearchNet), we propose several improvements in the learning procedure and show that the proposed FashionSearchNet-v2 can be generalized to different domains other than fashion.      
### 85.Learning a Weight Map for Weakly-Supervised Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14131.pdf)
>  In the weakly supervised localization setting, supervision is given as an image-level label. We propose to employ an image classifier $f$ and to train a generative network $g$ that outputs, given the input image, a per-pixel weight map that indicates the location of the object within the image. Network $g$ is trained by minimizing the discrepancy between the output of the classifier $f$ on the original image and its output given the same image weighted by the output of $g$. The scheme requires a regularization term that ensures that $g$ does not provide a uniform weight, and an early stopping criterion in order to prevent $g$ from over-segmenting the image. Our results indicate that the method outperforms existing localization methods by a sizable margin on the challenging fine-grained classification datasets, as well as a generic image recognition dataset. Additionally, the obtained weight map is also state-of-the-art in weakly supervised segmentation in fine-grained categorization datasets.      
### 86.Cross-Task Consistency Learning Framework for Multi-Task Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14122.pdf)
>  Multi-task learning (MTL) is an active field in deep learning in which we train a model to jointly learn multiple tasks by exploiting relationships between the tasks. It has been shown that MTL helps the model share the learned features between tasks and enhance predictions compared to when learning each task independently. We propose a new learning framework for 2-task MTL problem that uses the predictions of one task as inputs to another network to predict the other task. We define two new loss terms inspired by cycle-consistency loss and contrastive learning, alignment loss and cross-task consistency loss. Both losses are designed to enforce the model to align the predictions of multiple tasks so that the model predicts consistently. We theoretically prove that both losses help the model learn more efficiently and that cross-task consistency loss is better in terms of alignment with the straight-forward predictions. Experimental results also show that our proposed model achieves significant performance on the benchmark Cityscapes and NYU dataset.      
### 87.CHARTER: heatmap-based multi-type chart data extraction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14103.pdf)
>  The digital conversion of information stored in documents is a great source of knowledge. In contrast to the documents text, the conversion of the embedded documents graphics, such as charts and plots, has been much less explored. We present a method and a system for end-to-end conversion of document charts into machine readable tabular data format, which can be easily stored and analyzed in the digital domain. Our approach extracts and analyses charts along with their graphical elements and supporting structures such as legends, axes, titles, and captions. Our detection system is based on neural networks, trained solely on synthetic data, eliminating the limiting factor of data collection. As opposed to previous methods, which detect graphical elements using bounding-boxes, our networks feature auxiliary domain specific heatmaps prediction enabling the precise detection of pie charts, line and scatter plots which do not fit the rectangular bounding-box presumption. Qualitative and quantitative results show high robustness and precision, improving upon previous works on popular benchmarks      
### 88.Gated SwitchGAN for multi-domain facial image translation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14096.pdf)
>  Recent studies on multi-domain facial image translation have achieved impressive results. The existing methods generally provide a discriminator with an auxiliary classifier to impose domain translation. However, these methods neglect important information regarding domain distribution matching. To solve this problem, we propose a switch generative adversarial network (SwitchGAN) with a more adaptive discriminator structure and a matched generator to perform delicate image translation among multiple domains. A feature-switching operation is proposed to achieve feature selection and fusion in our conditional modules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Furthermore, we also introduce a new capability of our generator that represents attribute intensity control and extracts content information without tailored training. Experiments on the Morph, RaFD and CelebA databases visually and quantitatively show that our extended SwitchGAN (i.e., Gated SwitchGAN) can achieve better translation results than StarGAN, AttGAN and STGAN. The attribute classification accuracy achieved using the trained ResNet-18 model and the FID score obtained using the ImageNet pretrained Inception-v3 model also quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of our models.      
### 89.Deep MAGSAC++  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14093.pdf)
>  We propose Deep MAGSAC++ combining the advantages of traditional and deep robust estimators. We introduce a novel loss function that exploits the orientation and scale from partially affine covariant features, e.g., SIFT, in a geometrically justifiable manner. The new loss helps in learning higher-order information about the underlying scene geometry. Moreover, we propose a new sampler for RANSAC that always selects the sample with the highest probability of consisting only of inliers. After every unsuccessful iteration, the probabilities are updated in a principled way via a Bayesian approach. The prediction of the deep network is exploited as prior inside the sampler. Benefiting from the new loss, the proposed sampler, and a number of technical advancements, Deep MAGSAC++ is superior to the state-of-the-art both in terms of accuracy and run-time on thousands of image pairs from publicly available datasets for essential and fundamental matrix estimation.      
### 90.Image preprocessing and modified adaptive thresholding for improving OCR  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14075.pdf)
>  In this paper I have proposed a method to find the major pixel intensity inside the text and thresholding an image accordingly to make it easier to be used for optical character recognition (OCR) models. In our method, instead of editing whole image, I are removing all other features except the text boundaries and the color filling them. In this approach, the grayscale intensity of the letters from the input image are used as one of thresholding parameters. The performance of the developed model is finally validated with input images, with and without image processing followed by OCR by PyTesseract. Based on the results obtained, it can be observed that this algorithm can be efficiently applied in the field of image processing for OCR.      
### 91.PAPooling: Graph-based Position Adaptive Aggregation of Local Geometry in Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14067.pdf)
>  Fine-grained geometry, captured by aggregation of point features in local regions, is crucial for object recognition and scene understanding in point clouds. Nevertheless, existing preeminent point cloud backbones usually incorporate max/average pooling for local feature aggregation, which largely ignores points' positional distribution, leading to inadequate assembling of fine-grained structures. To mitigate this bottleneck, we present an efficient alternative to max pooling, Position Adaptive Pooling (PAPooling), that explicitly models spatial relations among local points using a novel graph representation, and aggregates features in a position adaptive manner, enabling position-sensitive representation of aggregated features. Specifically, PAPooling consists of two key steps, Graph Construction and Feature Aggregation, respectively in charge of constructing a graph with edges linking the center point with every neighboring point in a local region to map their relative positional information to channel-wise attentive weights, and adaptively aggregating local point features based on the generated weights through Graph Convolution Network (GCN). PAPooling is simple yet effective, and flexible enough to be ready to use for different popular backbones like PointNet++ and DGCNN, as a plug-andplay operator. Extensive experiments on various tasks ranging from 3D shape classification, part segmentation to scene segmentation well demonstrate that PAPooling can significantly improve predictive accuracy, while with minimal extra computational overhead. Code will be released.      
### 92.Detection of E-scooter Riders in Naturalistic Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14060.pdf)
>  E-scooters have become ubiquitous vehicles in major cities around the world.The numbers of e-scooters keep escalating, increasing their interactions with other cars on the road. Normal behavior of an e-scooter rider varies enormously to other vulnerable road users. This situation creates new challenges for vehicle active safety systems and automated driving functionalities, which require the detection of e-scooter riders as the first step. To our best knowledge, there is no existing computer vision model to detect these e-scooter riders. This paper presents a novel vision-based system to differentiate between e-scooter riders and regular pedestrians and a benchmark data set for e-scooter riders in natural scenes. We propose an efficient pipeline built over two existing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN), You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) and MobileNetV2. We fine-tune MobileNetV2 over our dataset and train the model to classify e-scooter riders and pedestrians. We obtain a recall of around 0.75 on our raw test sample to classify e-scooter riders with the whole pipeline. Moreover, the classification accuracy of trained MobileNetV2 on top of YOLOv3 is over 91%, with precision and recall over 0.9.      
### 93.NoFADE: Analyzing Diminishing Returns on CO2 Investment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14059.pdf)
>  Climate change continues to be a pressing issue that currently affects society at-large. It is important that we as a society, including the Computer Vision (CV) community take steps to limit our impact on the environment. In this paper, we (a) analyze the effect of diminishing returns on CV methods, and (b) propose a \textit{``NoFADE''}: a novel entropy-based metric to quantify model--dataset--complexity relationships. We show that some CV tasks are reaching saturation, while others are almost fully saturated. In this light, NoFADE allows the CV community to compare models and datasets on a similar basis, establishing an agnostic platform.      
### 94.EGFN: Efficient Geometry Feature Network for Fast Stereo 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14055.pdf)
>  Fast stereo based 3D object detectors have made great progress in the sense of inference time recently. However, they lag far behind high-precision oriented methods in accuracy. We argue that the main reason is the missing or poor 3D geometry feature representation in fast stereo based methods. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient geometry feature generation network (EGFN). The key of our EGFN is an efficient and effective 3D geometry feature representation (EGFR) module. In the EGFR module, light-weight cost volume features are firstly generated, then are efficiently converted into 3D space, and finally multi-scale features enhancement in in both image and 3D spaces is conducted to obtain the 3D geometry features: enhanced light-weight voxel features. In addition, we introduce a novel multi-scale knowledge distillation strategy to guide multi-scale 3D geometry features learning. Experimental results on the public KITTI test set shows that the proposed EGFN outperforms YOLOStsereo3D, the advanced fast method, by 5.16\% on mAP$_{3d}$ at the cost of merely additional 12 ms and hence achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for stereo 3D object detection. Our code will be publicly available.      
### 95.AI-supported Framework of Semi-Automatic Monoplotting for Monocular Oblique Visual Data Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14021.pdf)
>  In the last decades, the development of smartphones, drones, aerial patrols, and digital cameras enabled high-quality photographs available to large populations and, thus, provides an opportunity to collect massive data of the nature and society with global coverage. However, the data collected with new photography tools is usually oblique - they are difficult to be georeferenced, and huge amounts of data is often obsolete. Georeferencing oblique imagery data may be solved by a technique called monoplotting, which only requires a single image and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In traditional monoplotting, a human user has to manually choose a series of ground control point (GCP) pairs in the image and DEM and then determine the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the camera to establish a pixel-level correspondence between photos and the DEM to enable the mapping and georeferencing of objects in photos. This traditional method is difficult to scale due to several challenges including the labor-intensive inputs, the need of rich experience to identify well-defined GCPs, and limitations in camera pose estimation. Therefore, existing monoplotting methods are rarely used in analyzing large-scale databases or near-real-time warning systems. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a novel semi-automatic monoplotting framework that provides pixel-level correspondence between photos and DEMs requiring minimal human interventions. A pipeline of analyses was developed including key point detection in images and DEM rasters, retrieving georeferenced 3D DEM GCPs, regularized gradient-based optimization, pose estimation, ray tracing, and the correspondence identification between image pixels and real world coordinates. Two numerical experiments show that the framework is superior in georeferencing visual data in 3-D coordinates, paving a way toward fully automatic monoplotting methodology.      
### 96.Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Person Re-Identification via Human Learning Imitation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14014.pdf)
>  Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification has received significant attention due to its high practical value. In past years, by following the clustering and finetuning paradigm, researchers propose to utilize the teacher-student framework in their methods to decrease the domain gap between different person re-identification datasets. Inspired by recent teacher-student framework based methods, which try to mimic the human learning process either by making the student directly copy behavior from the teacher or selecting reliable learning materials, we propose to conduct further exploration to imitate the human learning process from different aspects, \textit{i.e.}, adaptively updating learning materials, selectively imitating teacher behaviors, and analyzing learning materials structures. The explored three components, collaborate together to constitute a new method for unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification, which is called Human Learning Imitation framework. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.      
### 97.Targeted Supervised Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13998.pdf)
>  Real-world data often exhibits long tail distributions with heavy class imbalance, where the majority classes can dominate the training process and alter the decision boundaries of the minority classes. Recently, researchers have investigated the potential of supervised contrastive learning for long-tailed recognition, and demonstrated that it provides a strong performance gain. In this paper, we show that while supervised contrastive learning can help improve performance, past baselines suffer from poor uniformity brought in by imbalanced data distribution. This poor uniformity manifests in samples from the minority class having poor separability in the feature space. To address this problem, we propose targeted supervised contrastive learning (TSC), which improves the uniformity of the feature distribution on the hypersphere. TSC first generates a set of targets uniformly distributed on a hypersphere. It then makes the features of different classes converge to these distinct and uniformly distributed targets during training. This forces all classes, including minority classes, to maintain a uniform distribution in the feature space, improves class boundaries, and provides better generalization even in the presence of long-tail data. Experiments on multiple datasets show that TSC achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed recognition tasks.      
### 98.Learning Continuous Environment Fields via Implicit Functions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13997.pdf)
>  We propose a novel scene representation that encodes reaching distance -- the distance between any position in the scene to a goal along a feasible trajectory. We demonstrate that this environment field representation can directly guide the dynamic behaviors of agents in 2D mazes or 3D indoor scenes. Our environment field is a continuous representation and learned via a neural implicit function using discretely sampled training data. We showcase its application for agent navigation in 2D mazes, and human trajectory prediction in 3D indoor environments. To produce physically plausible and natural trajectories for humans, we additionally learn a generative model that predicts regions where humans commonly appear, and enforce the environment field to be defined within such regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can generate both feasible and plausible trajectories efficiently and accurately.      
### 99.Label Assistant: A Workflow for Assisted Data Annotation in Image Segmentation Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13970.pdf)
>  Recent research in the field of computer vision strongly focuses on deep learning architectures to tackle image processing problems. Deep neural networks are often considered in complex image processing scenarios since traditional computer vision approaches are expensive to develop or reach their limits due to complex relations. However, a common criticism is the need for large annotated datasets to determine robust parameters. Annotating images by human experts is time-consuming, burdensome, and expensive. Thus, support is needed to simplify annotation, increase user efficiency, and annotation quality. In this paper, we propose a generic workflow to assist the annotation process and discuss methods on an abstract level. Thereby, we review the possibilities of focusing on promising samples, image pre-processing, pre-labeling, label inspection, or post-processing of annotations. In addition, we present an implementation of the proposal by means of a developed flexible and extendable software prototype nested in hybrid touchscreen/laptop device.      
### 100.Safe Screening for Sparse Conditional Random Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13958.pdf)
>  Sparse Conditional Random Field (CRF) is a powerful technique in computer vision and natural language processing for structured prediction. However, solving sparse CRFs in large-scale applications remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel safe dynamic screening method that exploits an accurate dual optimum estimation to identify and remove the irrelevant features during the training process. Thus, the problem size can be reduced continuously, leading to great savings in the computational cost without sacrificing any accuracy on the finally learned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first screening method which introduces the dual optimum estimation technique -- by carefully exploring and exploiting the strong convexity and the complex structure of the dual problem -- in static screening methods to dynamic screening. In this way, we can absorb the advantages of both the static and dynamic screening methods and avoid their drawbacks. Our estimation would be much more accurate than those developed based on the duality gap, which contributes to a much stronger screening rule. Moreover, our method is also the first screening method in sparse CRFs and even structure prediction models. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the speedup gained by our method is significant.      
### 101.Calibrated Feature Decomposition for Generalizable Person Re-Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13945.pdf)
>  Existing disentangled-based methods for generalizable person re-identification aim at directly disentangling person representations into domain-relevant interference and identity-relevant feature. However, they ignore that some crucial characteristics are stubbornly entwined in both the domain-relevant interference and identity-relevant feature, which are intractable to decompose in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Calibrated Feature Decomposition (CFD) module that focuses on improving the generalization capacity for person re-identification through a more judicious feature decomposition and reinforcement strategy. Specifically, a calibrated-and-standardized Batch normalization (CSBN) is designed to learn calibrated person representation by jointly exploring intra-domain calibration and inter-domain standardization of multi-source domain features. CSBN restricts instance-level inconsistency of feature distribution for each domain and captures intrinsic domain-level specific statistics. The calibrated person representation is subtly decomposed into the identity-relevant feature, domain feature, and the remaining entangled one. For enhancing the generalization ability and ensuring high discrimination of the identity-relevant feature, a calibrated instance normalization (CIN) is introduced to enforce discriminative id-relevant information, and filter out id-irrelevant information, and meanwhile the rich complementary clues from the remaining entangled feature are further employed to strengthen it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong generalization capability of our framework. Our models empowered by CFD modules significantly outperform the state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches on multiple widely-used benchmarks.

### 102.A Practical Contrastive Learning Framework for Single Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13924.pdf)
>  Contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success on various high-level tasks, but there are fewer methods proposed for low-level tasks. It is challenging to adopt vanilla contrastive learning technologies proposed for high-level visual tasks straight to low-level visual tasks since the acquired global visual representations are insufficient for low-level tasks requiring rich texture and context information. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for single image super-resolution (SISR). We investigate the contrastive learning-based SISR from two perspectives: sample construction and feature embedding. The existing methods propose some naive sample construction approaches (e.g., considering the low-quality input as a negative sample and the ground truth as a positive sample) and they adopt a prior model (e.g., pre-trained VGG model) to obtain the feature embedding instead of exploring a task-friendly one. To this end, we propose a practical contrastive learning framework for SISR that involves the generation of many informative positive and hard negative samples in frequency space. Instead of utilizing an additional pre-trained network, we design a simple but effective embedding network inherited from the discriminator network and can be iteratively optimized with the primary SR network making it task-generalizable. Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of our method compared with benchmark methods and show remarkable gains of up to 0.21 dB over the current state-of-the-art approaches for SISR.      
### 103.Sparse Subspace Clustering Friendly Deep Dictionary Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13920.pdf)
>  Subspace clustering techniques have shown promise in hyperspectral image segmentation. The fundamental assumption in subspace clustering is that the samples belonging to different clusters/segments lie in separable subspaces. What if this condition does not hold? We surmise that even if the condition does not hold in the original space, the data may be nonlinearly transformed to a space where it will be separable into subspaces. In this work, we propose a transformation based on the tenets of deep dictionary learning (DDL). In particular, we incorporate the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) loss in the DDL formulation. Here DDL nonlinearly transforms the data such that the transformed representation (of the data) is separable into subspaces. We show that the proposed formulation improves over the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in hyperspectral image clustering.      
### 104.A Hierarchy-Aware Pose Representation for Deep Character Animation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13907.pdf)
>  Data-driven character animation techniques rely on the existence of a properly established model of motion, capable of describing its rich context. However, commonly used motion representations often fail to accurately encode the full articulation of motion, or present artifacts. In this work, we address the fundamental problem of finding a robust pose representation for motion modeling, suitable for deep character animation, one that can better constrain poses and faithfully capture nuances correlated with skeletal characteristics. Our representation is based on dual quaternions, the mathematical abstractions with well-defined operations, which simultaneously encode rotational and positional orientation, enabling a hierarchy-aware encoding, centered around the root. We demonstrate that our representation overcomes common motion artifacts, and assess its performance compared to other popular representations. We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of various losses that can be incorporated during learning. Leveraging the fact that our representation implicitly encodes skeletal motion attributes, we train a network on a dataset comprising of skeletons with different proportions, without the need to retarget them first to a universal skeleton, which causes subtle motion elements to be missed. We show that smooth and natural poses can be achieved, paving the way for fascinating applications.      
### 105.Head and Body: Unified Detector and Graph Network for Person Search in Media  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13888.pdf)
>  Person search in media has seen increasing potential in Internet applications, such as video clipping and character collection. This task is common but overlooked by previous person search works which focus on surveillance scenes. The media scenarios have some different challenges from surveillance scenes. For example, a person may change his clothes frequently. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a Unified Detector and Graph Network (UDGNet) for person search in media. UDGNet is the first person search framework to detect and re-identify the human body and head simultaneously. Specifically, it first builds two branches based on a unified network to detect the human body and head, then the detected body and head are used for re-identification. This dual-task approach can significantly enhance discriminative learning. To tackle the cloth-changing issue, UDGNet builds two graphs to explore reliable links among cloth-changing samples and utilizes a graph network to learn better embeddings. This design effectively enhances the robustness of person search to cloth-changing challenges. Besides, we demonstrate that UDGNet can be implemented with both anchor-based and anchor-free person search frameworks and further achieve performance improvement. This paper also contributes a large-scale dataset for Person Search in Media (PSM), which provides both body and head annotations. It is by far the largest dataset for person search in media. Experiments show that UDGNet improves the anchor-free model AlignPS by 12.1% in mAP. Meanwhile, it shows good generalization across surveillance and longterm scenarios.

### 106.Learning Discriminative Shrinkage Deep Networks for Image Deconvolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13876.pdf)
>  Non-blind deconvolution is an ill-posed problem. Most existing methods usually formulate this problem into a maximum-a-posteriori framework and address it by designing kinds of regularization terms and data terms of the latent clear images. In this paper, we propose an effective non-blind deconvolution approach by learning discriminative shrinkage functions to implicitly model these terms. In contrast to most existing methods that use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or radial basis functions to simply learn the regularization term, we formulate both the data term and regularization term and split the deconvolution model into data-related and regularization-related sub-problems according to the alternating direction method of multipliers. We explore the properties of the Maxout function and develop a deep CNN model with a Maxout layer to learn discriminative shrinkage functions to directly approximate the solutions of these two sub-problems. Moreover, given the fast Fourier transform based image restoration usually leads to ringing artifacts while conjugate gradient-based image restoration is time-consuming, we develop the conjugate gradient network to restore the latent clear images effectively and efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art ones in terms of efficiency and accuracy.      
### 107.Temporal Context Mining for Learned Video Compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13850.pdf)
>  We address end-to-end learned video compression with a special focus on better learning and utilizing temporal contexts. For temporal context mining, we propose to store not only the previously reconstructed frames, but also the propagated features into the generalized decoded picture buffer. From the stored propagated features, we propose to learn multi-scale temporal contexts, and re-fill the learned temporal contexts into the modules of our compression scheme, including the contextual encoder-decoder, the frame generator, and the temporal context encoder. Our scheme discards the parallelization-unfriendly auto-regressive entropy model to pursue a more practical decoding time. We compare our scheme with x264 and x265 (representing industrial software for H.264 and H.265, respectively) as well as the official reference software for H.264, H.265, and H.266 (JM, HM, and VTM, respectively). When intra period is 32 and oriented to PSNR, our scheme outperforms H.265--HM by 14.4% bit rate saving; when oriented to MS-SSIM, our scheme outperforms H.266--VTM by 21.1% bit rate saving.      
### 108.Adaptive Image Transformations for Transfer-based Adversarial Attack  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13844.pdf)
>  Adversarial attacks provide a good way to study the robustness of deep learning models. One category of methods in transfer-based black-box attack utilizes several image transformation operations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples, which is effective, but fails to take the specific characteristic of the input image into consideration. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, called Adaptive Image Transformation Learner (AITL), which incorporates different image transformation operations into a unified framework to further improve the transferability of adversarial examples. Unlike the fixed combinational transformations used in existing works, our elaborately designed transformation learner adaptively selects the most effective combination of image transformations specific to the input image. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that our method significantly improves the attack success rates on both normally trained models and defense models under various settings.      
### 109.Adaptive Perturbation for Adversarial Attack  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13841.pdf)
>  In recent years, the security of deep learning models achieves more and more attentions with the rapid development of neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Almost all existing gradient-based attack methods use the sign function in the generation to meet the requirement of perturbation budget on $L_\infty$ norm. However, we find that the sign function may be improper for generating adversarial examples since it modifies the exact gradient direction. We propose to remove the sign function and directly utilize the exact gradient direction with a scaling factor for generating adversarial perturbations, which improves the attack success rates of adversarial examples even with fewer perturbations. Moreover, considering that the best scaling factor varies across different images, we propose an adaptive scaling factor generator to seek an appropriate scaling factor for each image, which avoids the computational cost for manually searching the scaling factor. Our method can be integrated with almost all existing gradient-based attack methods to further improve the attack success rates. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets show that our method exhibits higher transferability and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 110.DSC: Deep Scan Context Descriptor for Large-Scale Place Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13838.pdf)
>  LiDAR-based place recognition is an essential and challenging task both in loop closure detection and global relocalization. We propose Deep Scan Context (DSC), a general and discriminative global descriptor that captures the relationship among segments of a point cloud. Unlike previous methods that utilize either semantics or a sequence of adjacent point clouds for better place recognition, we only use raw point clouds to get competitive results. Concretely, we first segment the point cloud egocentrically to acquire centroids and eigenvalues of the segments. Then, we introduce a graph neural network to aggregate these features into an embedding representation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that DSC is robust to scene variants and outperforms existing methods.      
### 111.FQ-ViT: Fully Quantized Vision Transformer without Retraining  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13824.pdf)
>  Network quantization significantly reduces model inference complexity and has been widely used in real-world deployments. However, most existing quantization methods have been developed and tested mainly on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and suffer severe degradation when applied to Transformer-based architectures. In this work, we present a systematic method to reduce the performance degradation and inference complexity of Quantized Transformers. In particular, we propose Powers-of-Two Scale (PTS) to deal with the serious inter-channel variation of LayerNorm inputs in a hardware-friendly way. In addition, we propose Log-Int-Softmax (LIS) that can sustain the extreme non-uniform distribution of the attention maps while simplifying inference by using 4-bit quantization and the BitShift operator. Comprehensive experiments on various Transformer-based architectures and benchmarks show that our methods outperform previous works in performance while using even lower bit-width in attention maps. For instance, we reach 85.17% Top-1 accuracy with ViT-L on ImageNet and 51.4 mAP with Cascade Mask R-CNN (Swin-S) on COCO. To our knowledge, we are the first to achieve comparable accuracy degradation (~1%) on fully quantized Vision Transformers.

### 112.Recognition and Co-Analysis of Pedestrian Activities in Different Parts of Road using Traffic Camera Video  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13818.pdf)
>  Pedestrian safety is a priority for transportation system managers and operators, and a main focus of the Vision Zero strategy employed by the City of Austin, Texas. While there are a number of treatments and technologies to effectively improve pedestrian safety, identifying the location where these treatments are most needed remains a challenge. Current practice requires manual observation of candidate locations for limited time periods, leading to an identification process that is time consuming, lags behind traffic pattern changes over time, and lacks scalability. Mid-block locations, where safety countermeasures are often needed the most, are especially hard to identify and monitor. The goal for this research is to understand the correlation between bus stop locations and mid-block crossings, so as to assist traffic engineers in implementing Vision Zero strategies to improve pedestrian safety. In a prior work, we have developed a tool to detect pedestrian crossing events with traffic camera video using a deep neural network model to identify crossing events. In this paper, we extend the methods to identify bus stop usage with traffic camera video from off-the-shelf CCTV pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) traffic monitoring cameras installed at nearby intersections. We correlate the video detection results for mid-block crossings near a bus stop, with pedestrian activity at the bus stops in each side of the mid-block crossing. We also implement a web portal to facilitate manual review of pedestrian activity detections by automating creation of video clips that show only crossing events, thereby vastly improving the efficiency of the human review process.      
### 113.Video Frame Interpolation Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13817.pdf)
>  Existing methods for video interpolation heavily rely on deep convolution neural networks, and thus suffer from their intrinsic limitations, such as content-agnostic kernel weights and restricted receptive field. To address these issues, we propose a Transformer-based video interpolation framework that allows content-aware aggregation weights and considers long-range dependencies with the self-attention operations. To avoid the high computational cost of global self-attention, we introduce the concept of local attention into video interpolation and extend it to the spatial-temporal domain. Furthermore, we propose a space-time separation strategy to save memory usage, which also improves performance. In addition, we develop a multi-scale frame synthesis scheme to fully realize the potential of Transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on a variety of benchmark datasets.      
### 114.Video Content Classification using Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13813.pdf)
>  Video content classification is an important research content in computer vision, which is widely used in many fields, such as image and video retrieval, computer vision. This paper presents a model that is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which develops, trains, and optimizes a deep learning network that can identify the type of video content and classify them into categories such as "Animation, Gaming, natural content, flat content, etc". To enhance the performance of the model novel keyframe extraction method is included to classify only the keyframes, thereby reducing the overall processing time without sacrificing any significant performance.      
### 115.Document Layout Analysis with Aesthetic-Guided Image Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13809.pdf)
>  Document layout analysis (DLA) plays an important role in information extraction and document understanding. At present, document layout analysis has reached a milestone achievement, however, document layout analysis of non-Manhattan is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose an image layer modeling method to tackle this challenge. To measure the proposed image layer modeling method, we propose a manually-labeled non-Manhattan layout fine-grained segmentation dataset named FPD. As far as we know, FPD is the first manually-labeled non-Manhattan layout fine-grained segmentation dataset. To effectively extract fine-grained features of documents, we propose an edge embedding network named L-E^3Net. Experimental results prove that our proposed image layer modeling method can better deal with the fine-grained segmented document of the non-Manhattan layout.      
### 116.LAFITE: Towards Language-Free Training for Text-to-Image Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13792.pdf)
>  One of the major challenges in training text-to-image generation models is the need of a large number of high-quality image-text pairs. While image samples are often easily accessible, the associated text descriptions typically require careful human captioning, which is particularly time- and cost-consuming. In this paper, we propose the first work to train text-to-image generation models without any text data. Our method leverages the well-aligned multi-modal semantic space of the powerful pre-trained CLIP model: the requirement of text-conditioning is seamlessly alleviated via generating text features from image features. Extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We obtain state-of-the-art results in the standard text-to-image generation tasks. Importantly, the proposed language-free model outperforms most existing models trained with full image-text pairs. Furthermore, our method can be applied in fine-tuning pre-trained models, which saves both training time and cost in training text-to-image generation models. Our pre-trained model obtains competitive results in zero-shot text-to-image generation on the MS-COCO dataset, yet with around only 1% of the model size and training data size relative to the recently proposed large DALL-E model.      
### 117.Benchmarking Shadow Removal for Facial Landmark Detection and Beyond  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13790.pdf)
>  Facial landmark detection is a very fundamental and significant vision task with many important applications. In practice, facial landmark detection can be affected by a lot of natural degradations. One of the most common and important degradations is the shadow caused by light source blocking. While many advanced shadow removal methods have been proposed to recover the image quality in recent years, their effects to facial landmark detection are not well studied. For example, it remains unclear whether shadow removal could enhance the robustness of facial landmark detection to diverse shadow patterns or not. In this work, for the first attempt, we construct a novel benchmark to link two independent but related tasks (i.e., shadow removal and facial landmark detection). In particular, the proposed benchmark covers diverse face shadows with different intensities, sizes, shapes, and locations. Moreover, to mine hard shadow patterns against facial landmark detection, we propose a novel method (i.e., adversarial shadow attack), which allows us to construct a challenging subset of the benchmark for a comprehensive analysis. With the constructed benchmark, we conduct extensive analysis on three state-of-the-art shadow removal methods and three landmark detectors. The observation of this work motivates us to design a novel detection-aware shadow removal framework, which empowers shadow removal to achieve higher restoration quality and enhance the shadow robustness of deployed facial landmark detectors.      
### 118.Unsupervised MKL in Multi-layer Kernel Machines  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13769.pdf)
>  Kernel based Deep Learning using multi-layer kernel machines(MKMs) was proposed by Y.Cho and L.K. Saul in \cite{saul}. In MKMs they used only one kernel(arc-cosine kernel) at a layer for the kernel PCA-based feature extraction. We propose to use multiple kernels in each layer by taking a convex combination of many kernels following an unsupervised learning strategy. Empirical study is conducted on \textit{mnist-back-rand}, \textit{mnist-back-image} and \textit{mnist-rot-back-image} datasets generated by adding random noise in the image background of MNIST dataset. Experimental results indicate that using MKL in MKMs earns a better representation of the raw data and improves the classifier performance.      
### 119.The Implicit Values of A Good Hand Shake: Handheld Multi-Frame Neural Depth Refinement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13738.pdf)
>  Modern smartphones can continuously stream multi-megapixel RGB images at 60~Hz, synchronized with high-quality 3D pose information and low-resolution LiDAR-driven depth estimates. During a snapshot photograph, the natural unsteadiness of the photographer's hands offers millimeter-scale variation in camera pose, which we can capture along with RGB and depth in a circular buffer. In this work we explore how, from a bundle of these measurements acquired during viewfinding, we can combine dense micro-baseline parallax cues with kilopixel LiDAR depth to distill a high-fidelity depth map. We take a test-time optimization approach and train a coordinate MLP to output photometrically and geometrically consistent depth estimates at the continuous coordinates along the path traced by the photographer's natural hand shake. The proposed method brings high-resolution depth estimates to 'point-and-shoot' tabletop photography and requires no additional hardware, artificial hand motion, or user interaction beyond the press of a button.      
### 120.Towards Robust and Adaptive Motion Forecasting: A Causal Representation Perspective  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14820.pdf)
>  Learning behavioral patterns from observational data has been a de-facto approach to motion forecasting. Yet, the current paradigm suffers from two shortcomings: brittle under covariate shift and inefficient for knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose to address these challenges from a causal representation perspective. We first introduce a causal formalism of motion forecasting, which casts the problem as a dynamic process with three groups of latent variables, namely invariant mechanisms, style confounders, and spurious features. We then introduce a learning framework that treats each group separately: (i) unlike the common practice of merging datasets collected from different locations, we exploit their subtle distinctions by means of an invariance loss encouraging the model to suppress spurious correlations; (ii) we devise a modular architecture that factorizes the representations of invariant mechanisms and style confounders to approximate a causal graph; (iii) we introduce a style consistency loss that not only enforces the structure of style representations but also serves as a self-supervisory signal for test-time refinement on the fly. Experiment results on synthetic and real datasets show that our three proposed components significantly improve the robustness and reusability of the learned motion representations, outperforming prior state-of-the-art motion forecasting models for out-of-distribution generalization and low-shot transfer.      
### 121.Unsupervised cross domain learning with applications to 7 layer segmentation of OCTs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14804.pdf)
>  Unsupervised cross domain adaptation for OCT 7 layer segmentation and other medical applications where labeled training data is only available in a source domain and unavailable in the target domain. Our proposed method helps generalize of deep learning to many areas in the medical field where labeled training data are expensive and time consuming to acquire or where target domains are too novel to have had labelling.      
### 122.FaceAtlasAR: Atlas of Facial Acupuncture Points in Augmented Reality  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14755.pdf)
>  Acupuncture is a technique in which practitioners stimulate specific points on the body. These points, called acupuncture points (or acupoints), anatomically define areas on the skin relative to some landmarks on the body. Traditional acupuncture treatment relies on experienced acupuncturists for precise positioning of acupoints. A novice typically finds it difficult because of the lack of visual cues. This project presents FaceAtlasAR, a prototype system that localizes and visualizes facial acupoints in an augmented reality (AR) context. The system aims to 1) localize facial acupoints and auricular zone map in an anatomical yet feasible way, 2) overlay the requested acupoints by category in AR, and 3) show auricular zone map on the ears. We adopt Mediapipe, a cross-platform machine learning framework, to build the pipeline that runs on desktop and Android phones. We perform experiments on different benchmarks, including "In-the-wild", AMI ear datasets, and our own annotated datasets. Results show the localization accuracy of 95% for facial acupoints, 99% / 97% ("In-the-wild" / AMI) for auricular zone map, and high robustness. With this system, users, even not professionals, can position the acupoints quickly for their self-acupressure treatments.      
### 123.SAGCI-System: Towards Sample-Efficient, Generalizable, Compositional, and Incremental Robot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14693.pdf)
>  Building general-purpose robots to perform an enormous amount of tasks in a large variety of environments at the human level is notoriously complicated. It requires the robot learning to be sample-efficient, generalizable, compositional, and incremental. In this work, we introduce a systematic learning framework called SAGCI-system towards achieving these above four requirements. Our system first takes the raw point clouds gathered by the camera mounted on the robot's wrist as the inputs and produces initial modeling of the surrounding environment represented as a URDF. Our system adopts a learning-augmented differentiable simulation that loads the URDF. The robot then utilizes the interactive perception to interact with the environments to online verify and modify the URDF. Leveraging the simulation, we propose a new model-based RL algorithm combining object-centric and robot-centric approaches to efficiently produce policies to accomplish manipulation tasks. We apply our system to perform articulated object manipulation, both in the simulation and the real world. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed learning framework.

### 124.Learning Fair Classifiers with Partially Annotated Group Labels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14581.pdf)
>  Recently, fairness-aware learning have become increasingly crucial, but we note that most of those methods operate by assuming the availability of fully annotated group-labels. We emphasize that such assumption is unrealistic for real-world applications since group label annotations are expensive and can conflict with privacy issues. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario, dubbed as Algorithmic Fairness with the Partially annotated Group labels (Fair-PG). We observe that the existing fairness methods, which only use the data with group-labels, perform even worse than the vanilla training, which simply uses full data only with target labels, under Fair-PG. To address this problem, we propose a simple Confidence-based Group Label assignment (CGL) strategy that is readily applicable to any fairness-aware learning method. Our CGL utilizes an auxiliary group classifier to assign pseudo group labels, where random labels are assigned to low confident samples. We first theoretically show that our method design is better than the vanilla pseudo-labeling strategy in terms of fairness criteria. Then, we empirically show for UTKFace, CelebA and COMPAS datasets that by combining CGL and the state-of-the-art fairness-aware in-processing methods, the target accuracies and the fairness metrics are jointly improved compared to the baseline methods. Furthermore, we convincingly show that our CGL enables to naturally augment the given group-labeled dataset with external datasets only with target labels so that both accuracy and fairness metrics can be improved. We will release our implementation publicly to make future research reproduce our results.      
### 125.Deep Video Coding with Dual-Path Generative Adversarial Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14474.pdf)
>  The deep-learning-based video coding has attracted substantial attention for its great potential to squeeze out the spatial-temporal redundancies of video sequences. This paper proposes an efficient codec namely dual-path generative adversarial network-based video codec (DGVC). First, we propose a dual-path enhancement with generative adversarial network (DPEG) to reconstruct the compressed video details. The DPEG consists of an $\alpha$-path of auto-encoder and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), which facilitates the structure feature reconstruction with a large receptive field and multi-frame references, and a $\beta$-path of residual attention blocks, which facilitates the reconstruction of local texture features. Both paths are fused and co-trained by a generative-adversarial process. Second, we reuse the DPEG network in both motion compensation and quality enhancement modules, which are further combined with motion estimation and entropy coding modules in our DGVC framework. Third, we employ a joint training of deep video compression and enhancement to further improve the rate-distortion (RD) performance. Compared with x265 LDP very fast mode, our DGVC reduces the average bit-per-pixel (bpp) by 39.39%/54.92% at the same PSNR/MS-SSIM, which outperforms the state-of-the art deep video codecs by a considerable margin.      
### 126.Improving traffic sign recognition by active search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14426.pdf)
>  We describe an iterative active-learning algorithm to recognise rare traffic signs. A standard ResNet is trained on a training set containing only a single sample of the rare class. We demonstrate that by sorting the samples of a large, unlabeled set by the estimated probability of belonging to the rare class, we can efficiently identify samples from the rare class. This works despite the fact that this estimated probability is usually quite low. A reliable active-learning loop is obtained by labeling these candidate samples, including them in the training set, and iterating the procedure. Further, we show that we get similar results starting from a single synthetic sample. Our results are important as they indicate a straightforward way of improving traffic-sign recognition for automated driving systems. In addition, they show that we can make use of the information hidden in low confidence outputs, which is usually ignored.      
### 127.Enhanced Transfer Learning Through Medical Imaging and Patient Demographic Data Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14388.pdf)
>  In this work we examine the performance enhancement in classification of medical imaging data when image features are combined with associated non-image data. We compare the performance of eight state-of-the-art deep neural networks in classification tasks when using only image features, compared to when these are combined with patient metadata. We utilise transfer learning with networks pretrained on ImageNet used directly as feature extractors and fine tuned on the target domain. Our experiments show that performance can be significantly enhanced with the inclusion of metadata and use interpretability methods to identify which features lead to these enhancements. Furthermore, our results indicate that the performance enhancement for natural medical imaging (e.g. optical images) benefit most from direct use of pre-trained models, whereas non natural images (e.g. representations of non imaging data) benefit most from fine tuning pre-trained networks. These enhancements come at a negligible additional cost in computation time, and therefore is a practical method for other applications.      
### 128.Unsupervised Image Denoising with Frequency Domain Knowledge  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14362.pdf)
>  Supervised learning-based methods yield robust denoising results, yet they are inherently limited by the need for large-scale clean/noisy paired datasets. The use of unsupervised denoisers, on the other hand, necessitates a more detailed understanding of the underlying image statistics. In particular, it is well known that apparent differences between clean and noisy images are most prominent on high-frequency bands, justifying the use of low-pass filters as part of conventional image preprocessing steps. However, most learning-based denoising methods utilize only one-sided information from the spatial domain without considering frequency domain information. To address this limitation, in this study we propose a frequency-sensitive unsupervised denoising method. To this end, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used as a base structure. Subsequently, we include spectral discriminator and frequency reconstruction loss to transfer frequency knowledge into the generator. Results using natural and synthetic datasets indicate that our unsupervised learning method augmented with frequency information achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance, suggesting that frequency domain information could be a viable factor in improving the overall performance of unsupervised learning-based methods.      
### 129.SwiftSRGAN -- Rethinking Super-Resolution for Efficient and Real-time Inference  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14320.pdf)
>  In recent years, there have been several advancements in the task of image super-resolution using the state of the art Deep Learning-based architectures. Many super-resolution-based techniques previously published, require high-end and top-of-the-line Graphics Processing Unit (GPUs) to perform image super-resolution. With the increasing advancements in Deep Learning approaches, neural networks have become more and more compute hungry. We took a step back and, focused on creating a real-time efficient solution. We present an architecture that is faster and smaller in terms of its memory footprint. The proposed architecture uses Depth-wise Separable Convolutions to extract features and, it performs on-par with other super-resolution GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) while maintaining real-time inference and a low memory footprint. A real-time super-resolution enables streaming high resolution media content even under poor bandwidth conditions. While maintaining an efficient trade-off between the accuracy and latency, we are able to produce a comparable performance model which is one-eighth (1/8) the size of super-resolution GANs and computes 74 times faster than super-resolution GANs.      
### 130.A General Framework for Defending Against Backdoor Attacks via Influence Graph  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14309.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose a new and general framework to defend against backdoor attacks, inspired by the fact that attack triggers usually follow a \textsc{specific} type of attacking pattern, and therefore, poisoned training examples have greater impacts on each other during training. We introduce the notion of the {\it influence graph}, which consists of nodes and edges respectively representative of individual training points and associated pair-wise influences. The influence between a pair of training points represents the impact of removing one training point on the prediction of another, approximated by the influence function \citep{koh2017understanding}. Malicious training points are extracted by finding the maximum average sub-graph subject to a particular size. Extensive experiments on computer vision and natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed framework.      
### 131.Customizing an Affective Tutoring System Based on Facial Expression and Head Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14262.pdf)
>  In recent years, the main problem in e-learning has shifted from analyzing content to personalization of learning environment by Intelligence Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Therefore, by designing personalized teaching models, learners are able to have a successful and satisfying experience in achieving their learning goals. Affective Tutoring Systems (ATSs) are some kinds of ITS that can recognize and respond to affective states of learner. In this study, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a system to personalize the learning environment based on the facial emotions recognition, head pose estimation, and cognitive style of learners. First, a unit called Intelligent Analyzer (AI) created which was responsible for recognizing facial expression and head angles of learners. Next, the ATS was built which mainly made of two units: ITS, IA. Results indicated that with the ATS, participants needed less efforts to pass the tests. In other words, we observed when the IA unit was activated, learners could pass the final tests in fewer attempts than those for whom the IA unit was deactivated. Additionally, they showed an improvement in terms of the mean passing score and academic satisfaction.      
### 132.3D High-Quality Magnetic Resonance Image Restoration in Clinics Using Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14259.pdf)
>  Shortening acquisition time and reducing the motion-artifact are two of the most essential concerns in magnetic resonance imaging. As a promising solution, deep learning-based high quality MR image restoration has been investigated to generate higher resolution and motion artifact-free MR images from lower resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition time, without costing additional acquisition time or modifying the pulse sequences. However, numerous problems still exist to prevent deep learning approaches from becoming practical in the clinic environment. Specifically, most of the prior works focus solely on the network model but ignore the impact of various downsampling strategies on the acquisition time. Besides, the long inference time and high GPU consumption are also the bottle neck to deploy most of the prior works in clinics. Furthermore, prior studies employ random movement in retrospective motion artifact generation, resulting in uncontrollable severity of motion artifact. More importantly, doctors are unsure whether the generated MR images are trustworthy, making diagnosis difficult. To overcome all these problems, we employed a unified 2D deep learning neural network for both 3D MRI super resolution and motion artifact reduction, demonstrating such a framework can achieve better performance in 3D MRI restoration task compared to other states of the art methods and remains the GPU consumption and inference time significantly low, thus easier to deploy. We also analyzed several downsampling strategies based on the acceleration factor, including multiple combinations of in-plane and through-plane downsampling, and developed a controllable and quantifiable motion artifact generation method. At last, the pixel-wise uncertainty was calculated and used to estimate the accuracy of generated image, providing additional information for reliable diagnosis.      
### 133.Learning a model of shape selectivity in V4 cells reveals shape encoding mechanisms in the brain  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14250.pdf)
>  The mechanisms involved in transforming early visual signals to curvature representations in V4 are unknown. We propose a hierarchical model that reveals V1/V2 encodings that are essential components for this transformation to the reported curvature representations in V4. Then, by relaxing the often-imposed prior of a single Gaussian, V4 shape selectivity is learned in the last layer of the hierarchy from Macaque V4 responses. We found that V4 cells integrate multiple shape parts from the full spatial extent of their receptive fields with similar excitatory and inhibitory contributions. Our results uncover new details in existing data about shape selectivity in V4 neurons that with further experiments can enhance our understanding of processing in this area. Accordingly, we propose designs for a stimulus set that allow removing shape parts without disturbing the curvature signal to isolate part contributions to V4 responses.      
### 134.Low-complexity Rounded KLT Approximation for Image Compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14239.pdf)
>  The Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) is often used for data decorrelation and dimensionality reduction. Because its computation depends on the matrix of covariances of the input signal, the use of the KLT in real-time applications is severely constrained by the difficulty in developing fast algorithms to implement it. In this context, this paper proposes a new class of low-complexity transforms that are obtained through the application of the round function to the elements of the KLT matrix. The proposed transforms are evaluated considering figures of merit that measure the coding power and distance of the proposed approximations to the exact KLT and are also explored in image compression experiments. Fast algorithms are introduced for the proposed approximate transforms. It was shown that the proposed transforms perform well in image compression and require a low implementation cost.      
### 135.Local Learning Matters: Rethinking Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14213.pdf)
>  Federated learning (FL) is a promising strategy for performing privacy-preserving, distributed learning with a network of clients (i.e., edge devices). However, the data distribution among clients is often non-IID in nature, making efficient optimization difficult. To alleviate this issue, many FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across clients by introducing a variety of proximal terms, some incurring considerable compute and/or memory overheads, to restrain local updates with respect to the global model. Instead, we consider rethinking solutions to data heterogeneity in FL with a focus on local learning generality rather than proximal restriction. To this end, we first present a systematic study informed by second-order indicators to better understand algorithm effectiveness in FL. Interestingly, we find that standard regularization methods are surprisingly strong performers in mitigating data heterogeneity effects. Based on our findings, we further propose a simple and effective method, FedAlign, to overcome data heterogeneity and the pitfalls of previous methods. FedAlign achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art FL methods across a variety of settings while minimizing computation and memory overhead. Code will be publicly available.      
### 136.Emergent Graphical Conventions in a Visual Communication Game  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14210.pdf)
>  Humans communicate with graphical sketches apart from symbolic languages. While recent studies of emergent communication primarily focus on symbolic languages, their settings overlook the graphical sketches existing in human communication; they do not account for the evolution process through which symbolic sign systems emerge in the trade-off between iconicity and symbolicity. In this work, we take the very first step to model and simulate such an evolution process via two neural agents playing a visual communication game; the sender communicates with the receiver by sketching on a canvas. We devise a novel reinforcement learning method such that agents are evolved jointly towards successful communication and abstract graphical conventions. To inspect the emerged conventions, we carefully define three key properties -- iconicity, symbolicity, and semanticity -- and design evaluation methods accordingly. Our experimental results under different controls are consistent with the observation in studies of human graphical conventions. Of note, we find that evolved sketches can preserve the continuum of semantics under proper environmental pressures. More interestingly, co-evolved agents can switch between conventionalized and iconic communication based on their familiarity with referents. We hope the present research can pave the path for studying emergent communication with the unexplored modality of sketches.      
### 137.NCVX: A User-Friendly and Scalable Package for Nonconvex Optimization in Machine Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13984.pdf)
>  Optimizing nonconvex (NCVX) problems, especially those nonsmooth (NSMT) and constrained (CSTR), is an essential part of machine learning and deep learning. But it is hard to reliably solve this type of problems without optimization expertise. Existing general-purpose NCVX optimization packages are powerful, but typically cannot handle nonsmoothness. GRANSO is among the first packages targeting NCVX, NSMT, CSTR problems. However, it has several limitations such as the lack of auto-differentiation and GPU acceleration, which preclude the potential broad deployment by non-experts. To lower the technical barrier for the machine learning community, we revamp GRANSO into a user-friendly and scalable python package named NCVX, featuring auto-differentiation, GPU acceleration, tensor input, scalable QP solver, and zero dependency on proprietary packages. As a highlight, NCVX can solve general CSTR deep learning problems, the first of its kind. NCVX is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://ncvx.org" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>, with detailed documentation and numerous examples from machine learning and other fields.      
### 138.Learning A 3D-CNN and Transformer Prior for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13923.pdf)
>  To solve the ill-posed problem of hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSISR), an usually method is to use the prior information of the hyperspectral images (HSIs) as a regularization term to constrain the objective function. Model-based methods using hand-crafted priors cannot fully characterize the properties of HSIs. Learning-based methods usually use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the implicit priors of HSIs. However, the learning ability of CNN is limited, it only considers the spatial characteristics of the HSIs and ignores the spectral characteristics, and convolution is not effective for long-range dependency modeling. There is still a lot of room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel HSISR method that uses Transformer instead of CNN to learn the prior of HSIs. Specifically, we first use the proximal gradient algorithm to solve the HSISR model, and then use an unfolding network to simulate the iterative solution processes. The self-attention layer of Transformer makes it have the ability of spatial global interaction. In addition, we add 3D-CNN behind the Transformer layers to better explore the spatio-spectral correlation of HSIs. Both quantitative and visual results on two widely used HSI datasets and the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a considerable gain compared to all the mainstream algorithms including the most competitive conventional methods and the recently proposed deep learning-based methods.      
### 139.AdaDM: Enabling Normalization for Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13905.pdf)
>  Normalization like Batch Normalization (BN) is a milestone technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers in deep learning, enabling faster training and better generalization accuracy. However, in fidelity image Super-Resolution (SR), it is believed that normalization layers get rid of range flexibility by normalizing the features and they are simply removed from modern SR networks. In this paper, we study this phenomenon quantitatively and qualitatively. We found that the standard deviation of the residual feature shrinks a lot after normalization layers, which causes the performance degradation in SR networks. Standard deviation reflects the amount of variation of pixel values. When the variation becomes smaller, the edges will become less discriminative for the network to resolve. To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive Deviation Modulator (AdaDM), in which a modulation factor is adaptively predicted to amplify the pixel deviation. For better generalization performance, we apply BN in state-of-the-art SR networks with the proposed AdaDM. Meanwhile, the deviation amplification strategy in AdaDM makes the edge information in the feature more distinguishable. As a consequence, SR networks with BN and our AdaDM can get substantial performance improvements on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness of our method.      
### 140.Towards Principled Disentanglement for Domain Generalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13839.pdf)
>  A fundamental challenge for machine learning models is generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, in part due to spurious correlations. To tackle this challenge, we first formalize the OOD generalization problem as constrained optimization, called Disentanglement-constrained Domain Generalization (DDG). We relax this non-trivial constrained optimization to a tractable form with finite-dimensional parameterization and empirical approximation. Then a theoretical analysis of the extent to which the above transformations deviates from the original problem is provided. Based on the transformation, we propose a primal-dual algorithm for joint representation disentanglement and domain generalization. In contrast to traditional approaches based on domain adversarial training and domain labels, DDG jointly learns semantic and variation encoders for disentanglement, enabling flexible manipulation and augmentation on training data. DDG aims to learn intrinsic representations of semantic concepts that are invariant to nuisance factors and generalizable across different domains. Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that DDG can achieve competitive OOD performance and uncover interpretable salient structures within data.      
### 141.Average Outward Flux Skeletons for Environment Mapping and Topology Matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13826.pdf)
>  We consider how to directly extract a road map (also known as a topological representation) of an initially-unknown 2-dimensional environment via an online procedure that robustly computes a retraction of its boundaries. In this article, we first present the online construction of a topological map and the implementation of a control law for guiding the robot to the nearest unexplored area, first presented in [1]. The proposed method operates by allowing the robot to localize itself on a partially constructed map, calculate a path to unexplored parts of the environment (frontiers), compute a robust terminating condition when the robot has fully explored the environment, and achieve loop closure detection. The proposed algorithm results in smooth safe paths for the robot's navigation needs. The presented approach is any time algorithm that has the advantage that it allows for the active creation of topological maps from laser scan data, as it is being acquired. We also propose a navigation strategy based on a heuristic where the robot is directed towards nodes in the topological map that open to empty space. We then extend the work in [1] by presenting a topology matching algorithm that leverages the strengths of a particular spectral correspondence method [2], to match the mapped environments generated from our topology-making algorithm. Here, we concentrated on implementing a system that could be used to match the topologies of the mapped environment by using AOF Skeletons. In topology matching between two given maps and their AOF skeletons, we first find correspondences between points on the AOF skeletons of two different environments. We then align the (2D) points of the environments themselves. We also compute a distance measure between two given environments, based on their extracted AOF skeletons and their topology, as the sum of the matching errors between corresponding points.
