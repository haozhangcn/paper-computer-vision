### 1.GenSDF: Two-Stage Learning of Generalizable Signed Distance Functions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02780.pdf)
>  We investigate the generalization capabilities of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) for learning 3D object representations for unseen and unlabeled point clouds. Existing methods can fit SDFs to a handful of object classes and boast fine detail or fast inference speeds, but do not generalize well to unseen shapes. We introduce a two-stage semi-supervised meta-learning approach that transfers shape priors from labeled to unlabeled data to reconstruct unseen object categories. The first stage uses an episodic training scheme to simulate training on unlabeled data and meta-learns initial shape priors. The second stage then introduces unlabeled data with disjoint classes in a semi-supervised scheme to diversify these priors and achieve generalization. We assess our method on both synthetic data and real collected point clouds. Experimental results and analysis validate that our approach outperforms existing neural SDF methods and is capable of robust zero-shot inference on 100+ unseen classes.

### 2.Blended Latent Diffusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02779.pdf)
>  The tremendous progress in neural image generation, coupled with the emergence of seemingly omnipotent vision-language models has finally enabled text-based interfaces for creating and editing images. Handling generic images requires a diverse underlying generative model, hence the latest works utilize diffusion models, which were shown to surpass GANs in terms of diversity. One major drawback of diffusion models, however, is their relatively slow inference time. In this paper, we present an accelerated solution to the task of local text-driven editing of generic images, where the desired edits are confined to a user-provided mask. Our solution leverages a recent text-to-image Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), which speeds up diffusion by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. We first convert the LDM into a local image editor by incorporating Blended Diffusion into it. Next we propose an optimization-based solution for the inherent inability of this LDM to accurately reconstruct images. Finally, we address the scenario of performing local edits using thin masks. We evaluate our method against the available baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively and demonstrate that in addition to being faster, our method achieves better precision than the baselines while mitigating some of their artifacts.

### 3.Mask DINO: Towards A Unified Transformer-based Framework for Object Detection and Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02777.pdf)
>  In this paper we present Mask DINO, a unified object detection and segmentation framework. Mask DINO extends DINO (DETR with Improved Denoising Anchor Boxes) by adding a mask prediction branch which supports all image segmentation tasks (instance, panoptic, and semantic). It makes use of the query embeddings from DINO to dot-product a high-resolution pixel embedding map to predict a set of binary masks. Some key components in DINO are extended for segmentation through a shared architecture and training process. Mask DINO is simple, efficient, scalable, and benefits from joint large-scale detection and segmentation datasets. Our experiments show that Mask DINO significantly outperforms all existing specialized segmentation methods, both on a ResNet-50 backbone and a pre-trained model with SwinL backbone. Notably, Mask DINO establishes the best results to date on instance segmentation (54.5 AP on COCO), panoptic segmentation (59.4 PQ on COCO), and semantic segmentation (60.8 mIoU on ADE20K). Code will be avaliable at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/IDEACVR/MaskDINO" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 4.Volumetric Disentanglement for 3D Scene Manipulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02776.pdf)
>  Recently, advances in differential volumetric rendering enabled significant breakthroughs in the photo-realistic and fine-detailed reconstruction of complex 3D scenes, which is key for many virtual reality applications. However, in the context of augmented reality, one may also wish to effect semantic manipulations or augmentations of objects within a scene. To this end, we propose a volumetric framework for (i) disentangling or separating, the volumetric representation of a given foreground object from the background, and (ii) semantically manipulating the foreground object, as well as the background. Our framework takes as input a set of 2D masks specifying the desired foreground object for training views, together with the associated 2D views and poses, and produces a foreground-background disentanglement that respects the surrounding illumination, reflections, and partial occlusions, which can be applied to both training and novel views. Our method enables the separate control of pixel color and depth as well as 3D similarity transformations of both the foreground and background objects. We subsequently demonstrate the applicability of our framework on a number of downstream manipulation tasks including object camouflage, non-negative 3D object inpainting, 3D object translation, 3D object inpainting, and 3D text-based object manipulation. Full results are given in our project webpage at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://sagiebenaim.github.io/volumetric-disentanglement/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 5.Multimodal Contrastive Learning with LIMoE: the Language-Image Mixture of Experts  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02770.pdf)
>  Large sparsely-activated models have obtained excellent performance in multiple domains. However, such models are typically trained on a single modality at a time. We present the Language-Image MoE, LIMoE, a sparse mixture of experts model capable of multimodal learning. LIMoE accepts both images and text simultaneously, while being trained using a contrastive loss. MoEs are a natural fit for a multimodal backbone, since expert layers can learn an appropriate partitioning of modalities. However, new challenges arise; in particular, training stability and balanced expert utilization, for which we propose an entropy-based regularization scheme. Across multiple scales, we demonstrate remarkable performance improvement over dense models of equivalent computational cost. LIMoE-L/16 trained comparably to CLIP-L/14 achieves 78.6% zero-shot ImageNet accuracy (vs. 76.2%), and when further scaled to H/14 (with additional data) it achieves 84.1%, comparable to state-of-the-art methods which use larger custom per-modality backbones and pre-training schemes. We analyse the quantitative and qualitative behavior of LIMoE, and demonstrate phenomena such as differing treatment of the modalities and the organic emergence of modality-specific experts.      
### 6.Dual Decomposition of Convex Optimization Layers for Consistent Attention in Medical Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02761.pdf)
>  A key concern in integrating machine learning models in medicine is the ability to interpret their reasoning. Popular explainability methods have demonstrated satisfactory results in natural image recognition, yet in medical image analysis, many of these approaches provide partial and noisy explanations. Recently, attention mechanisms have shown compelling results both in their predictive performance and in their interpretable qualities. A fundamental trait of attention is that it leverages salient parts of the input which contribute to the model's prediction. To this end, our work focuses on the explanatory value of attention weight distributions. We propose a multi-layer attention mechanism that enforces consistent interpretations between attended convolutional layers using convex optimization. We apply duality to decompose the consistency constraints between the layers by reparameterizing their attention probability distributions. We further suggest learning the dual witness by optimizing with respect to our objective; thus, our implementation uses standard back-propagation, hence it is highly efficient. While preserving predictive performance, our proposed method leverages weakly annotated medical imaging data and provides complete and faithful explanations to the model's prediction.      
### 7.CORE: Consistent Representation Learning for Face Forgery Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02749.pdf)
>  Face manipulation techniques develop rapidly and arouse widespread public concerns. Despite that vanilla convolutional neural networks achieve acceptable performance, they suffer from the overfitting issue. To relieve this issue, there is a trend to introduce some erasing-based augmentations. We find that these methods indeed attempt to implicitly induce more consistent representations for different augmentations via assigning the same label for different augmented images. However, due to the lack of explicit regularization, the consistency between different representations is less satisfactory. Therefore, we constrain the consistency of different representations explicitly and propose a simple yet effective framework, COnsistent REpresentation Learning (CORE). Specifically, we first capture the different representations with different augmentations, then regularize the cosine distance of the representations to enhance the consistency. Extensive experiments (in-dataset and cross-dataset) demonstrate that CORE performs favorably against state-of-the-art face forgery detection methods.      
### 8.People Tracking in Panoramic Video for Guiding Robots  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02735.pdf)
>  A guiding robot aims to effectively bring people to and from specific places within environments that are possibly unknown to them. During this operation the robot should be able to detect and track the accompanied person, trying never to lose sight of her/him. A solution to minimize this event is to use an omnidirectional camera: its 360° Field of View (FoV) guarantees that any framed object cannot leave the FoV if not occluded or very far from the sensor. However, the acquired panoramic videos introduce new challenges in perception tasks such as people detection and tracking, including the large size of the images to be processed, the distortion effects introduced by the cylindrical projection and the periodic nature of panoramic images. In this paper, we propose a set of targeted methods that allow to effectively adapt to panoramic videos a standard people detection and tracking pipeline originally designed for perspective cameras. Our methods have been implemented and tested inside a deep learning-based people detection and tracking framework with a commercial 360° camera. Experiments performed on datasets specifically acquired for guiding robot applications and on a real service robot show the effectiveness of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art systems. We release with this paper the acquired and annotated datasets and the open-source implementation of our method.      
### 9.Revisiting Realistic Test-Time Training: Sequential Inference and Adaptation by Anchored Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02721.pdf)
>  Deploying models on target domain data subject to distribution shift requires adaptation. Test-time training (TTT) emerges as a solution to this adaptation under a realistic scenario where access to full source domain data is not available and instant inference on target domain is required. Despite many efforts into TTT, there is a confusion over the experimental settings, thus leading to unfair comparisons. In this work, we first revisit TTT assumptions and categorize TTT protocols by two key factors. Among the multiple protocols, we adopt a realistic sequential test-time training (sTTT) protocol, under which we further develop a test-time anchored clustering (TTAC) approach to enable stronger test-time feature learning. TTAC discovers clusters in both source and target domain and match the target clusters to the source ones to improve generalization. Pseudo label filtering and iterative updating are developed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of anchored clustering. We demonstrate that under all TTT protocols TTAC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on five TTT datasets. We hope this work will provide a fair benchmarking of TTT methods and future research should be compared within respective protocols. A demo code is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/TTAC" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 10.Scene Aware Person Image Generation through Global Contextual Conditioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02717.pdf)
>  Person image generation is an intriguing yet challenging problem. However, this task becomes even more difficult under constrained situations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline to generate and insert contextually relevant person images into an existing scene while preserving the global semantics. More specifically, we aim to insert a person such that the location, pose, and scale of the person being inserted blends in with the existing persons in the scene. Our method uses three individual networks in a sequential pipeline. At first, we predict the potential location and the skeletal structure of the new person by conditioning a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) on the existing human skeletons present in the scene. Next, the predicted skeleton is refined through a shallow linear network to achieve higher structural accuracy in the generated image. Finally, the target image is generated from the refined skeleton using another generative network conditioned on a given image of the target person. In our experiments, we achieve high-resolution photo-realistic generation results while preserving the general context of the scene. We conclude our paper with multiple qualitative and quantitative benchmarks on the results.      
### 11.Day-to-Night Image Synthesis for Training Nighttime Neural ISPs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02715.pdf)
>  Many flagship smartphone cameras now use a dedicated neural image signal processor (ISP) to render noisy raw sensor images to the final processed output. Training nightmode ISP networks relies on large-scale datasets of image pairs with: (1) a noisy raw image captured with a short exposure and a high ISO gain; and (2) a ground truth low-noise raw image captured with a long exposure and low ISO that has been rendered through the ISP. Capturing such image pairs is tedious and time-consuming, requiring careful setup to ensure alignment between the image pairs. In addition, ground truth images are often prone to motion blur due to the long exposure. To address this problem, we propose a method that synthesizes nighttime images from daytime images. Daytime images are easy to capture, exhibit low-noise (even on smartphone cameras) and rarely suffer from motion blur. We outline a processing framework to convert daytime raw images to have the appearance of realistic nighttime raw images with different levels of noise. Our procedure allows us to easily produce aligned noisy and clean nighttime image pairs. We show the effectiveness of our synthesis framework by training neural ISPs for nightmode rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using our synthetic nighttime images together with small amounts of real data (e.g., 5% to 10%) yields performance almost on par with training exclusively on real nighttime images.

### 12.FuSS: Fusing Superpixels for Improved Segmentation Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02714.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose two different approaches to improve the semantic consistency of Open Set Semantic Segmentation. First, we propose a method called OpenGMM that extends the OpenPCS framework using a Gaussian Mixture of Models to model the distribution of pixels for each class in a multimodal manner. The second approach is a post-processing which uses superpixels to enforce highly homogeneous regions to behave equally, rectifying erroneous classified pixels within these regions, we also proposed a novel superpixel method called FuSS. All tests were performed on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets, and both methods were capable to improve quantitative and qualitative results for both datasets. Besides that, the post-process with FuSS achieved state-of-the-art results for both datasets. The official implementation is available at: \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/iannunes/FuSS" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 13.Separable Self-attention for Mobile Vision Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02680.pdf)
>  Mobile vision transformers (MobileViT) can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several mobile vision tasks, including classification and detection. Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as compared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency bottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in transformers, which requires $O(k^2)$ time complexity with respect to the number of tokens (or patches) $k$. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations (e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention, impacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. $O(k)$. A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTv2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection. With about three million parameters, MobileViTv2 achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.6% on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming MobileViT by about 1% while running $3.2\times$ faster on a mobile device. <br>Our source code is available at: \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}      
### 14.Learning with Capsules: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02664.pdf)
>  Capsule networks were proposed as an alternative approach to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning object-centric representations, which can be leveraged for improved generalization and sample complexity. Unlike CNNs, capsule networks are designed to explicitly model part-whole hierarchical relationships by using groups of neurons to encode visual entities, and learn the relationships between those entities. Promising early results achieved by capsule networks have motivated the deep learning community to continue trying to improve their performance and scalability across several application areas. However, a major hurdle for capsule network research has been the lack of a reliable point of reference for understanding their foundational ideas and motivations. The aim of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the capsule network research landscape, which will serve as a valuable resource for the community going forward. To that end, we start with an introduction to the fundamental concepts and motivations behind capsule networks, such as equivariant inference in computer vision. We then cover the technical advances in the capsule routing mechanisms and the various formulations of capsule networks, e.g. generative and geometric. Additionally, we provide a detailed explanation of how capsule networks relate to the popular attention mechanism in Transformers, and highlight non-trivial conceptual similarities between them in the context of representation learning. Afterwards, we explore the extensive applications of capsule networks in computer vision, video and motion, graph representation learning, natural language processing, medical imaging and many others. To conclude, we provide an in-depth discussion regarding the main hurdles in capsule network research, and highlight promising research directions for future work.      
### 15.Scaling Vision Transformers to Gigapixel Images via Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02647.pdf)
>  Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their multi-scale and hierarchical variations have been successful at capturing image representations but their use has been generally studied for low-resolution images (e.g. - 256x256, 384384). For gigapixel whole-slide imaging (WSI) in computational pathology, WSIs can be as large as 150000x150000 pixels at 20X magnification and exhibit a hierarchical structure of visual tokens across varying resolutions: from 16x16 images capture spatial patterns among cells, to 4096x4096 images characterizing interactions within the tissue microenvironment. We introduce a new ViT architecture called the Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer (HIPT), which leverages the natural hierarchical structure inherent in WSIs using two levels of self-supervised learning to learn high-resolution image representations. HIPT is pretrained across 33 cancer types using 10,678 gigapixel WSIs, 408,218 4096x4096 images, and 104M 256x256 images. We benchmark HIPT representations on 9 slide-level tasks, and demonstrate that: 1) HIPT with hierarchical pretraining outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for cancer subtyping and survival prediction, 2) self-supervised ViTs are able to model important inductive biases about the hierarchical structure of phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment.      
### 16.Hardware-accelerated Mars Sample Localization via deep transfer learning from photorealistic simulations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02622.pdf)
>  The goal of the Mars Sample Return campaign is to collect soil samples from the surface of Mars and return them to Earth for further study. The samples will be acquired and stored in metal tubes by the Perseverance rover and deposited on the Martian surface. As part of this campaign, it is expected the Sample Fetch Rover will be in charge of localizing and gathering up to 35 sample tubes over 150 Martian sols. Autonomous capabilities are critical for the success of the overall campaign and for the Sample Fetch Rover in particular. This work proposes a novel approach for the autonomous detection and pose estimation of the sample tubes. For the detection stage, a Deep Neural Network and transfer learning from a synthetic dataset are proposed. The dataset is created from photorealistic 3D simulations of Martian scenarios. Additionally, Computer Vision techniques are used to estimate the detected sample tubes poses. Finally, laboratory tests of the Sample Localization procedure are performed using the ExoMars Testing Rover on a Mars-like testbed. These tests validate the proposed approach in different hardware architectures, providing promising results related to the sample detection and pose estimation.      
### 17.VPIT: Real-time Embedded Single Object 3D Tracking Using Voxel Pseudo Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02619.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel voxel-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) method called Voxel Pseudo Image Tracking (VPIT). VPIT is the first method that uses voxel pseudo images for 3D SOT. The input point cloud is structured by pillar-based voxelization, and the resulting pseudo image is used as an input to a 2D-like Siamese SOT method. The pseudo image is created in the Bird's-eye View (BEV) coordinates, and therefore the objects in it have constant size. Thus, only the object rotation can change in the new coordinate system and not the object scale. For this reason, we replace multi-scale search with a multi-rotation search, where differently rotated search regions are compared against a single target representation to predict both position and rotation of the object. Experiments on KITTI Tracking dataset show that VPIT is the fastest 3D SOT method and maintains competitive Success and Precision values. Application of a SOT method in a real-world scenario meets with limitations such as lower computational capabilities of embedded devices and a latency-unforgiving environment, where the method is forced to skip certain data frames if the inference speed is not high enough. We implement a real-time evaluation protocol and show that other methods lose most of their performance on embedded devices, while VPIT maintains its ability to track the object.      
### 18.Real-World Image Super-Resolution by Exclusionary Dual-Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02609.pdf)
>  Real-world image super-resolution is a practical image restoration problem that aims to obtain high-quality images from in-the-wild input, has recently received considerable attention with regard to its tremendous application potentials. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved promising restoration quality on real-world image super-resolution datasets, they ignore the relationship between L1- and perceptual- minimization and roughly adopt auxiliary large-scale datasets for pre-training. In this paper, we discuss the image types within a corrupted image and the property of perceptual- and Euclidean- based evaluation protocols. Then we propose a method, Real-World image Super-Resolution by Exclusionary Dual-Learning (RWSR-EDL) to address the feature diversity in perceptual- and L1- based cooperative learning. Moreover, a noise-guidance data collection strategy is developed to address the training time consumption in multiple datasets optimization. When an auxiliary dataset is incorporated, RWSR-EDL achieves promising results and repulses any training time increment by adopting the noise-guidance data collection strategy. Extensive experiments show that RWSR-EDL achieves competitive performance over state-of-the-art methods on four in-the-wild image super-resolution datasets.      
### 19.[Reproducibility Report] Explainable Deep One-Class Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02598.pdf)
>  Fully Convolutional Data Description (FCDD), an explainable version of the Hypersphere Classifier (HSC), directly addresses image anomaly detection (AD) and pixel-wise AD without any post-hoc explainer methods. The authors claim that FCDD achieves results comparable with the state-of-the-art in sample-wise AD on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 and exceeds the state-of-the-art on the pixel-wise task on MVTec-AD. We reproduced the main results of the paper using the author's code with minor changes and provide runtime requirements to achieve if (CPU memory, GPU memory, and training time). We propose another analysis methodology using a critical difference diagram, and further investigate the test performance of the model during the training phase.      
### 20.Team VI-I2R Technical Report on EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Challenge for Action Recognition 2021  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02573.pdf)
>  In this report, we present the technical details of our approach to the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) Challenge for Action Recognition. The EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset consists of daily kitchen activities focusing on the interaction between human hands and their surrounding objects. It is very challenging to accurately recognize these fine-grained activities, due to the presence of distracting objects and visually similar action classes, especially in the unlabelled target domain. Based on an existing method for video domain adaptation, i.e., TA3N, we propose to learn hand-centric features by leveraging the hand bounding box information for UDA on fine-grained action recognition. This helps reduce the distraction from background as well as facilitate the learning of domain-invariant features. To achieve high quality hand localization, we adopt an uncertainty-aware domain adaptation network, i.e., MEAA, to train a domain-adaptive hand detector, which only uses very limited hand bounding box annotations in the source domain but can generalize well to the unlabelled target domain. Our submission achieved the 1st place in terms of top-1 action recognition accuracy, using only RGB and optical flow modalities as input.      
### 21.Machine Learning for Detection of 3D Features using sparse X-ray data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02564.pdf)
>  In many inertial confinement fusion experiments, the neutron yield and other parameters cannot be completely accounted for with one and two dimensional models. This discrepancy suggests that there are three dimensional effects which may be significant. Sources of these effects include defects in the shells and shell interfaces, the fill tube of the capsule, and the joint feature in double shell targets. Due to their ability to penetrate materials, X-rays are used to capture the internal structure of objects. Methods such as Computational Tomography use X-ray radiographs from hundreds of projections in order to reconstruct a three dimensional model of the object. In experimental environments, such as the National Ignition Facility and Omega-60, the availability of these views is scarce and in many cases only consist of a single line of sight. Mathematical reconstruction of a 3D object from sparse views is an ill-posed inverse problem. These types of problems are typically solved by utilizing prior information. Neural networks have been used for the task of 3D reconstruction as they are capable of encoding and leveraging this prior information. We utilize half a dozen different convolutional neural networks to produce different 3D representations of ICF implosions from the experimental data. We utilize deep supervision to train a neural network to produce high resolution reconstructions. We use these representations to track 3D features of the capsules such as the ablator, inner shell, and the joint between shell hemispheres. Machine learning, supplemented by different priors, is a promising method for 3D reconstructions in ICF and X-ray radiography in general.      
### 22.Conversation Group Detection With Spatio-Temporal Context  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02559.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose an approach for detecting conversation groups in social scenarios like cocktail parties and networking events, from overhead camera recordings. We posit the detection of conversation groups as a learning problem that could benefit from leveraging the spatial context of the surroundings, and the inherent temporal context in interpersonal dynamics which is reflected in the temporal dynamics in human behavior signals, an aspect that has not been addressed in recent prior works. This motivates our approach which consists of a dynamic LSTM-based deep learning model that predicts continuous pairwise affinity values indicating how likely two people are in the same conversation group. These affinity values are also continuous in time, since relationships and group membership do not occur instantaneously, even though the ground truths of group membership are binary. Using the predicted affinity values, we apply a graph clustering method based on Dominant Set extraction to identify the conversation groups. We benchmark the proposed method against established methods on multiple social interaction datasets. Our results showed that the proposed method improves group detection performance in data that has more temporal granularity in conversation group labels. Additionally, we provide an analysis in the predicted affinity values in relation to the conversation group detection. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of the predicted affinity values in a forecasting framework to predict group membership for a given forecast horizon.      
### 23.Towards retrieving dispersion profiles using quantum-mimic Optical Coherence Tomography and Machine Learnin  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02547.pdf)
>  Artefacts in quantum-mimic Optical Coherence Tomography are considered detrimental because they scramble the images even for the simplest objects. They are a side effect of autocorrelation which is used in the quantum entanglement mimicking algorithm behind this method. Interestingly, the autocorrelation imprints certain characteristics onto an artefact - it makes its shape and characteristics depend on the amount of dispersion exhibited by the layer that artefact corresponds to. This unique relationship between the artefact and the layer's dispersion can be used to determine Group Velocity Dispersion (GVD) values of object layers and, based on them, build a dispersion-contrasted depth profile. The retrieval of GVD profiles is achieved via Machine Learning. During training, a neural network learns the relationship between GVD and the artefacts' shape and characteristics, and consequently, it is able to provide a good qualitative representation of object's dispersion profile for never-seen-before data: computer-generated single dispersive layers and experimental pieces of glass.      
### 24.RLSS: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Sequential Scene Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02544.pdf)
>  We present RLSS: a reinforcement learning algorithm for sequential scene generation. This is based on employing the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm for generative problems. In particular, we consider how to effectively reduce the action space by including a greedy search algorithm in the learning process. Our experiments demonstrate that our method converges for a relatively large number of actions and learns to generate scenes with predefined design objectives. This approach is placing objects iteratively in the virtual scene. In each step, the network chooses which objects to place and selects positions which result in maximal reward. A high reward is assigned if the last action resulted in desired properties whereas the violation of constraints is penalized. We demonstrate the capability of our method to generate plausible and diverse scenes efficiently by solving indoor planning problems and generating Angry Birds levels.      
### 25.Robustness Evaluation and Adversarial Training of an Instance Segmentation Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02539.pdf)
>  To evaluate the robustness of non-classifier models, we propose probabilistic local equivalence, based on the notion of randomized smoothing, as a way to quantitatively evaluate the robustness of an arbitrary function. In addition, to understand the effect of adversarial training on non-classifiers and to investigate the level of robustness that can be obtained without degrading performance on the training distribution, we apply Fast is Better than Free adversarial training together with the TRADES robust loss to the training of an instance segmentation network. In this direction, we were able to achieve a symmetric best dice score of 0.85 on the TuSimple lane detection challenge, outperforming the standardly-trained network's score of 0.82. Additionally, we were able to obtain an F-measure of 0.49 on manipulated inputs, in contrast to the standardly-trained network's score of 0. We show that probabilisitic local equivalence is able to successfully distinguish between standardly-trained and adversarially-trained models, providing another view of the improved robustness of the adversarially-trained models.      
### 26.3D-Augmented Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Image-based Object Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02531.pdf)
>  Image-based object pose estimation sounds amazing because in real applications the shape of object is oftentimes not available or not easy to take like photos. Although it is an advantage to some extent, un-explored shape information in 3D vision learning problem looks like "flaws in jade". In this paper, we deal with the problem in a reasonable new setting, namely 3D shape is exploited in the training process, and the testing is still purely image-based. We enhance the performance of image-based methods for category-agnostic object pose estimation by exploiting 3D knowledge learned by a multi-modal method. Specifically, we propose a novel contrastive knowledge distillation framework that effectively transfers 3D-augmented image representation from a multi-modal model to an image-based model. We integrate contrastive learning into the two-stage training procedure of knowledge distillation, which formulates an advanced solution to combine these two approaches for cross-modal tasks. We experimentally report state-of-the-art results compared with existing category-agnostic image-based methods by a large margin (up to +5% improvement on ObjectNet3D dataset), demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.      
### 27.BehavePassDB: Benchmarking Mobile Behavioral Biometrics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02502.pdf)
>  Mobile behavioral biometrics have become a popular topic of research, reaching promising results in terms of authentication, exploiting a multimodal combination of touchscreen and background sensor data. However, there is no way of knowing whether state-of-the-art classifiers in the literature can distinguish between the notion of user and device. In this article, we present a new database, BehavePassDB, structured into separate acquisition sessions and tasks to mimic the most common aspects of mobile Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). BehavePassDB is acquired through a dedicated mobile app installed on the subjects' devices, also including the case of different users on the same device for evaluation. We propose a standard experimental protocol and benchmark for the research community to perform a fair comparison of novel approaches with the state of the art. We propose and evaluate a system based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture with triplet loss and modality fusion at score level.      
### 28.NORPPA: NOvel Ringed seal re-identification by Pelage Pattern Aggregation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02498.pdf)
>  We propose a method for Saimaa ringed seal (Pusa hispida saimensis) re-identification. Access to large image volumes through camera trapping and crowdsourcing provides novel possibilities for animal monitoring and conservation and calls for automatic methods for analysis, in particular, when re-identifying individual animals from the images. The proposed method NOvel Ringed seal re-identification by Pelage Pattern Aggregation (NORPPA) utilizes the permanent and unique pelage pattern of Saimaa ringed seals and content-based image retrieval techniques. First, the query image is preprocessed, and each seal instance is segmented. Next, the seal's pelage pattern is extracted using a U-net encoder-decoder based method. Then, CNN-based affine invariant features are embedded and aggregated into Fisher Vectors. Finally, the cosine distance between the Fisher Vectors is used to find the best match from a database of known individuals. We perform extensive experiments of various modifications of the method on a new challenging Saimaa ringed seals re-identification dataset. The proposed method is shown to produce the best re-identification accuracy on our dataset in comparisons with alternative approaches.      
### 29.Why do CNNs Learn Consistent Representations in their First Layer Independent of Labels and Architecture?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02454.pdf)
>  It has previously been observed that the filters learned in the first layer of a CNN are qualitatively similar for different networks and tasks. We extend this finding and show a high quantitative similarity between filters learned by different networks. We consider the CNN filters as a filter bank and measure the sensitivity of the filter bank to different frequencies. We show that the sensitivity profile of different networks is almost identical, yet far from initialization. Remarkably, we show that it remains the same even when the network is trained with random labels. To understand this effect, we derive an analytic formula for the sensitivity of the filters in the first layer of a linear CNN. We prove that when the average patch in images of the two classes is identical, the sensitivity profile of the filters in the first layer will be identical in expectation when using the true labels or random labels and will only depend on the second-order statistics of image patches. We empirically demonstrate that the average patch assumption holds for realistic datasets. Finally we show that the energy profile of filters in nonlinear CNNs is highly correlated with the energy profile of linear CNNs and that our analysis of linear networks allows us to predict when representations learned by state-of-the-art networks trained on benchmark classification tasks will depend on the labels.      
### 30.Universal Photometric Stereo Network using Global Lighting Contexts  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02452.pdf)
>  This paper tackles a new photometric stereo task, named universal photometric stereo. Unlike existing tasks that assumed specific physical lighting models; hence, drastically limited their usability, a solution algorithm of this task is supposed to work for objects with diverse shapes and materials under arbitrary lighting variations without assuming any specific models. To solve this extremely challenging task, we present a purely data-driven method, which eliminates the prior assumption of lighting by replacing the recovery of physical lighting parameters with the extraction of the generic lighting representation, named global lighting contexts. We use them like lighting parameters in a calibrated photometric stereo network to recover surface normal vectors pixelwisely. To adapt our network to a wide variety of shapes, materials and lightings, it is trained on a new synthetic dataset which simulates the appearance of objects in the wild. Our method is compared with other state-of-the-art uncalibrated photometric stereo methods on our test data to demonstrate the significance of our method.      
### 31.Slim-neck by GSConv: A better design paradigm of detector architectures for autonomous vehicles  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02424.pdf)
>  Object detection is a difficult downstream task in computer vision. For the on-board edge computing platforms, a giant model is difficult to achieve the real-time detection requirement. And, a lightweight model built from a large number of the depth-wise separable convolutional layers cannot achieve the sufficient accuracy. We introduce a new method, GSConv, to lighten the model but maintain the accuracy. The GSConv balances the model's accuracy and speed better. And, we provide a design paradigm, slim-neck, to achieve a higher computational cost-effectiveness of the detectors. In experiments, our method obtains state-of-the-art results (e.g. 70.9% mAP0.5 for the SO-DA10M at a speed of ~100FPS on a Tesla T4) compared with the original networks. Code will be open source.      
### 32.Robust Image Protection Countering Cropping Manipulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02405.pdf)
>  Image cropping is an inexpensive and effective operation of maliciously altering image contents. Existing cropping detection mechanisms analyze the fundamental traces of image cropping, for example, chromatic aberration and vignetting to uncover cropping attack, yet fragile to common post-processing attacks which deceive forensics by removing such cues. Besides, they ignore the fact that recovering the cropped-out contents can unveil the purpose of the behaved cropping attack. This paper presents a novel robust watermarking scheme for image Cropping Localization and Recovery (CLR-Net). We first protect the original image by introducing imperceptible perturbations. Then, typical image post-processing attacks are simulated to erode the protected image. On the recipient's side, we predict the cropping mask and recover the original image. We propose two plug-and-play networks to improve the real-world robustness of CLR-Net, namely, the Fine-Grained generative JPEG simulator (FG-JPEG) and the Siamese image pre-processing network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the combined challenge of image cropping localization and entire image recovery from a fragment. Experiments demonstrate that CLR-Net can accurately localize the cropping as well as recover the details of the cropped-out regions with both high quality and fidelity, despite of the presence of image processing attacks of varied types.      
### 33.Semi-Supervised Segmentation of Mitochondria from Electron Microscopy Images Using Spatial Continuity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02392.pdf)
>  Morphology of mitochondria plays critical roles in mediating their physiological functions. Accurate segmentation of mitochondria from 3D electron microscopy (EM) images is essential to quantitative characterization of their morphology at the nanometer scale. Fully supervised deep learning models developed for this task achieve excellent performance but require substantial amounts of annotated data for training. However, manual annotation of EM images is laborious and time-consuming because of their large volumes, limited contrast, and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). To overcome this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning model that segments mitochondria by leveraging the spatial continuity of their structural, morphological, and contextual information in both labeled and unlabeled images. We use random piecewise affine transformation to synthesize comprehensive and realistic mitochondrial morphology for augmentation of training data. Experiments on the EPFL dataset show that our model achieves performance similar as that of state-of-the-art fully supervised models but requires only ~20% of their annotated training data. Our semi-supervised model is versatile and can also accurately segment other spatially continuous structures from EM images. Data and code of this study are openly accessible at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/cbmi-group/MPP" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 34.Bayesian intrinsic groupwise registration via explicit hierarchical disentanglement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02377.pdf)
>  Previous methods on multimodal groupwise registration typically require certain highly specialized similarity metrics with restrained applicability. In this work, we instead propose a general framework which formulates groupwise registration as a procedure of hierarchical Bayesian inference. Here, the imaging process of multimodal medical images, including shape transition and appearance variation, is characterized by a disentangled variational auto-encoder. To this end, we propose a novel variational posterior and network architecture that facilitate joint learning of the common structural representation and the desired spatial correspondences. The performance of the proposed model was validated on two publicly available multimodal datasets, i.e., BrainWeb and MS-CMR of the heart. Results have demonstrated the efficacy of our framework in realizing multimodal groupwise registration in an end-to-end fashion.      
### 35.CorticalFlow: A Diffeomorphic Mesh Deformation Module for Cortical Surface Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02374.pdf)
>  In this paper we introduce CorticalFlow, a new geometric deep-learning model that, given a 3-dimensional image, learns to deform a reference template towards a targeted object. To conserve the template mesh's topological properties, we train our model over a set of diffeomorphic transformations. This new implementation of a flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework benefits from a small GPU memory footprint, allowing the generation of surfaces with several hundred thousand vertices. To reduce topological errors introduced by its discrete resolution, we derive numeric conditions which improve the manifoldness of the predicted triangle mesh. To exhibit the utility of CorticalFlow, we demonstrate its performance for the challenging task of brain cortical surface reconstruction. In contrast to current state-of-the-art, CorticalFlow produces superior surfaces while reducing the computation time from nine and a half minutes to one second. More significantly, CorticalFlow enforces the generation of anatomically plausible surfaces; the absence of which has been a major impediment restricting the clinical relevance of such surface reconstruction methods.      
### 36.Sports Re-ID: Improving Re-Identification Of Players In Broadcast Videos Of Team Sports  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02373.pdf)
>  This work focuses on player re-identification in broadcast videos of team sports. Specifically, we focus on identifying the same player in images captured from different camera viewpoints during any given moment of a match. This task differs from traditional applications of person re-id in a few important ways. Firstly, players from the same team wear highly similar clothes, thereby making it harder to tell them apart. Secondly, there are only a few number of samples for each identity, which makes it harder to train a re-id system. Thirdly, the resolutions of the images are often quite low and vary a lot. This combined with heavy occlusions and fast movements of players greatly increase the challenges for re-id. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective hierarchical data sampling procedure and a centroid loss function that, when used together, increase the mean average precision (mAP) by 7 - 11.5 and the rank-1 (R1) by 8.8 - 14.9 without any change in the network or hyper-parameters used. Our data sampling procedure improves the similarity of the training and test distributions, and thereby aids in creating better estimates of the centroids of the embeddings (or feature vectors). Surprisingly, our study shows that in the presence of severely limited data, as is the case for our application, a simple centroid loss function based on euclidean distances significantly outperforms the popular triplet-centroid loss function. We show comparable improvements for both convolutional networks and vision transformers. Our approach is among the top ranked methods in the SoccerNet Re-Identification Challenge 2022 leaderboard (test-split) with a mAP of 86.0 and a R1 of 81.5. On the sequestered challenge split, we achieve an mAP of 84.9 and a R1 of 80.1. Research on re-id for sports-related applications is very limited and our work presents one of the first discussions in the literature on this.      
### 37.Scan2Part: Fine-grained and Hierarchical Part-level Understanding of Real-World 3D Scans  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02366.pdf)
>  We propose Scan2Part, a method to segment individual parts of objects in real-world, noisy indoor RGB-D scans. To this end, we vary the part hierarchies of objects in indoor scenes and explore their effect on scene understanding models. Specifically, we use a sparse U-Net-based architecture that captures the fine-scale detail of the underlying 3D scan geometry by leveraging a multi-scale feature hierarchy. In order to train our method, we introduce the Scan2Part dataset, which is the first large-scale collection providing detailed semantic labels at the part level in the real-world setting. In total, we provide 242,081 correspondences between 53,618 PartNet parts of 2,477 ShapeNet objects and 1,506 ScanNet scenes, at two spatial resolutions of 2 cm$^3$ and 5 cm$^3$. As output, we are able to predict fine-grained per-object part labels, even when the geometry is coarse or partially missing.      
### 38.Relation Matters: Foreground-aware Graph-based Relational Reasoning for Domain Adaptive Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02355.pdf)
>  Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) focuses on improving the generalization ability of object detectors via knowledge transfer. Recent advances in DAOD strive to change the emphasis of the adaptation process from global to local in virtue of fine-grained feature alignment methods. However, both the global and local alignment approaches fail to capture the topological relations among different foreground objects as the explicit dependencies and interactions between and within domains are neglected. In this case, only seeking one-vs-one alignment does not necessarily ensure the precise knowledge transfer. Moreover, conventional alignment-based approaches may be vulnerable to catastrophic overfitting regarding those less transferable regions (e.g. backgrounds) due to the accumulation of inaccurate localization results in the target domain. To remedy these issues, we first formulate DAOD as an open-set domain adaptation problem, in which the foregrounds and backgrounds are seen as the ``known classes'' and ``unknown class'' respectively. Accordingly, we propose a new and general framework for DAOD, named Foreground-aware Graph-based Relational Reasoning (FGRR), which incorporates graph structures into the detection pipeline to explicitly model the intra- and inter-domain foreground object relations on both pixel and semantic spaces, thereby endowing the DAOD model with the capability of relational reasoning beyond the popular alignment-based paradigm. The inter-domain visual and semantic correlations are hierarchically modeled via bipartite graph structures, and the intra-domain relations are encoded via graph attention mechanisms. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed FGRR exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on four DAOD benchmarks.      
### 39.Invariant Grounding for Video Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02349.pdf)
>  Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is the task of answering questions about a video. At its core is understanding the alignments between visual scenes in video and linguistic semantics in question to yield the answer. In leading VideoQA models, the typical learning objective, empirical risk minimization (ERM), latches on superficial correlations between video-question pairs and answers as the alignments. However, ERM can be problematic, because it tends to over-exploit the spurious correlations between question-irrelevant scenes and answers, instead of inspecting the causal effect of question-critical scenes. As a result, the VideoQA models suffer from unreliable reasoning. In this work, we first take a causal look at VideoQA and argue that invariant grounding is the key to ruling out the spurious correlations. Towards this end, we propose a new learning framework, Invariant Grounding for VideoQA (IGV), to ground the question-critical scene, whose causal relations with answers are invariant across different interventions on the complement. With IGV, the VideoQA models are forced to shield the answering process from the negative influence of spurious correlations, which significantly improves the reasoning ability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the superiority of IGV in terms of accuracy, visual explainability, and generalization ability over the leading baselines.      
### 40.Anomaly Detection with Test Time Augmentation and Consistency Evaluation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02345.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to unseen data: they may wrongly assign high confidence stcores to out-distribuion samples. Recent works try to solve the problem using representation learning methods and specific metrics. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective post-hoc anomaly detection algorithm named Test Time Augmentation Anomaly Detection (TTA-AD), inspired by a novel observation. Specifically, we observe that in-distribution data enjoy more consistent predictions for its original and augmented versions on a trained network than out-distribution data, which separates in-distribution and out-distribution samples. Experiments on various high-resolution image benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTA-AD achieves comparable or better detection performance under dataset-vs-dataset anomaly detection settings with a 60%~90\% running time reduction of existing classifier-based algorithms. We provide empirical verification that the key to TTA-AD lies in the remaining classes between augmented features, which has long been partially ignored by previous works. Additionally, we use RUNS as a surrogate to analyze our algorithm theoretically.      
### 41.Contrastive Graph Multimodal Model for Text Classification in Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02343.pdf)
>  The extraction of text information in videos serves as a critical step towards semantic understanding of videos. It usually involved in two steps: (1) text recognition and (2) text classification. To localize texts in videos, we can resort to large numbers of text recognition methods based on OCR technology. However, to our knowledge, there is no existing work focused on the second step of video text classification, which will limit the guidance to downstream tasks such as video indexing and browsing. In this paper, we are the first to address this new task of video text classification by fusing multimodal information to deal with the challenging scenario where different types of video texts may be confused with various colors, unknown fonts and complex layouts. In addition, we tailor a specific module called CorrelationNet to reinforce feature representation by explicitly extracting layout information. Furthermore, contrastive learning is utilized to explore inherent connections between samples using plentiful unlabeled videos. Finally, we construct a new well-defined industrial dataset from the news domain, called TI-News, which is dedicated to building and evaluating video text recognition and classification applications. Extensive experiments on TI-News demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.      
### 42.WHU-Stereo: A Challenging Benchmark for Stereo Matching of High-Resolution Satellite Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02342.pdf)
>  Stereo matching of high-resolution satellite images (HRSI) is still a fundamental but challenging task in the field of photogrammetry and remote sensing. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated tremendous potential for stereo matching on public benchmark datasets. However, datasets for stereo matching of satellite images are scarce. To facilitate further research, this paper creates and publishes a challenging dataset, termed WHU-Stereo, for stereo matching DL network training and testing. This dataset is created by using airborne LiDAR point clouds and high-resolution stereo imageries taken from the Chinese GaoFen-7 satellite (GF-7). The WHU-Stereo dataset contains more than 1700 epipolar rectified image pairs, which cover six areas in China and includes various kinds of landscapes. We have assessed the accuracy of ground-truth disparity maps, and it is proved that our dataset achieves comparable precision compared with existing state-of-the-art stereo matching datasets. To verify its feasibility, in experiments, the hand-crafted SGM stereo matching algorithm and recent deep learning networks have been tested on the WHU-Stereo dataset. Experimental results show that deep learning networks can be well trained and achieves higher performance than hand-crafted SGM algorithm, and the dataset has great potential in remote sensing application. The WHU-Stereo dataset can serve as a challenging benchmark for stereo matching of high-resolution satellite images, and performance evaluation of deep learning models.

### 43.OrdinalCLIP: Learning Rank Prompts for Language-Guided Ordinal Regression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02338.pdf)
>  This paper presents a language-powered paradigm for ordinal regression. Existing methods usually treat each rank as a category and employ a set of weights to learn these concepts. These methods are easy to overfit and usually attain unsatisfactory performance as the learned concepts are mainly derived from the training set. Recent large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown impressive performance on various visual tasks. In this paper, we propose to learn the rank concepts from the rich semantic CLIP latent space. Specifically, we reformulate this task as an image-language matching problem with a contrastive objective, which regards labels as text and obtains a language prototype from a text encoder for each rank. While prompt engineering for CLIP is extremely time-consuming, we propose OrdinalCLIP, a differentiable prompting method for adapting CLIP for ordinal regression. OrdinalCLIP consists of learnable context tokens and learnable rank embeddings; The learnable rank embeddings are constructed by explicitly modeling numerical continuity, resulting in well-ordered, compact language prototypes in the CLIP space. Once learned, we can only save the language prototypes and discard the huge language model, resulting in zero additional computational overhead compared with the linear head counterpart. Experimental results show that our paradigm achieves competitive performance in general ordinal regression tasks, and gains improvements in few-shot and distribution shift settings for age estimation.      
### 44.MASNet:Improve Performance of Siamese Networks with Mutual-attention for Remote Sensing Change Detection Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02331.pdf)
>  Siamese networks are widely used for remote sensing change detection tasks. A vanilla siamese network has two identical feature extraction branches which share weights, these two branches work independently and the feature maps are not fused until about to be sent to a decoder head. However we find that it is critical to exchange information between two feature extraction branches at early stage for change detection task. In this work we present Mutual-Attention Siamese Network (MASNet), a general siamese network with mutual-attention plug-in, so to exchange information between the two feature extraction branches. We show that our modification improve the performance of siamese networks on multi change detection datasets, and it works for both convolutional neural network and visual transformer.      
### 45.JigsawHSI: a network for Hyperspectral Image classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02327.pdf)
>  This article describes the performance of JigsawHSI,a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on Inception but tailored for geoscientific analyses, on classification with the Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas hyperspectral image data sets. The network is compared against HybridSN, a spectral-spatial 3D-CNN followed by 2D-CNN that achieves state-of-the-art results in the datasets. This short article proves that JigsawHSI is able to meet or exceed HybridSN performance in all three cases. Additionally, the code and toolkit are made available.      
### 46.Evaluation-oriented Knowledge Distillation for Deep Face Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02325.pdf)
>  Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely-used technique that utilizes large networks to improve the performance of compact models. Previous KD approaches usually aim to guide the student to mimic the teacher's behavior completely in the representation space. However, such one-to-one corresponding constraints may lead to inflexible knowledge transfer from the teacher to the student, especially those with low model capacities. Inspired by the ultimate goal of KD methods, we propose a novel Evaluation oriented KD method (EKD) for deep face recognition to directly reduce the performance gap between the teacher and student models during training. Specifically, we adopt the commonly used evaluation metrics in face recognition, i.e., False Positive Rate (FPR) and True Positive Rate (TPR) as the performance indicator. According to the evaluation protocol, the critical pair relations that cause the TPR and FPR difference between the teacher and student models are selected. Then, the critical relations in the student are constrained to approximate the corresponding ones in the teacher by a novel rank-based loss function, giving more flexibility to the student with low capacity. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our EKD over state-of-the-art competitors.      
### 47.Bootstrapping Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Anatomical-aware Contrastive Distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02307.pdf)
>  Contrastive learning has shown great promise over annotation scarcity problems in the context of medical image segmentation. Existing approaches typically assume a balanced class distribution for both labeled and unlabeled medical images. However, medical image data in reality is commonly imbalanced (i.e., multi-class label imbalance), which naturally yields blurry contours and usually incorrectly labels rare objects. Moreover, it remains unclear whether all negative samples are equally negative. In this work, we present ACTION, an Anatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON framework, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, we first develop an iterative contrastive distillation algorithm by softly labeling the negatives rather than binary supervision between positive and negative pairs. We also capture more semantically similar features from the randomly chosen negative set compared to the positives to enforce the diversity of the sampled data. Second, we raise a more important question: Can we really handle imbalanced samples to yield better performance? Hence, the key innovation in ACTION is to learn global semantic relationship across the entire dataset and local anatomical features among the neighbouring pixels with minimal additional memory footprint. During the training, we introduce anatomical contrast by actively sampling a sparse set of hard negative pixels, which can generate smoother segmentation boundaries and more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments across two benchmark datasets and different unlabeled settings show that ACTION performs comparable or better than the current state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods. Our code and models will be publicly available.      
### 48.HIFI-Net: A Novel Network for Enhancement to Underwater Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02295.pdf)
>  A novel network for enhancement to underwater images is proposed in this paper. It contains a Reinforcement Fusion Module for Haar wavelet images (RFM-Haar) based on Reinforcement Fusion Unit (RFU), which is used to fuse an original image and some important information within it. Fusion is achieved for better enhancement. As this network make "Haar Images into Fusion Images", it is called HIFI-Net. The experimental results show the proposed HIFI-Net performs best among many state-of-the-art methods on three datasets at three normal metrics and a new metric.      
### 49.ACT: Semi-supervised Domain-adaptive Medical Image Segmentation with Asymmetric Co-Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02288.pdf)
>  We aim to develop semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) for medical image segmentation, which is largely underexplored. We propose to exploit both labeled source and target domain data, in addition to unlabeled target data in a unified manner. Specifically, we present a novel asymmetric co-training (ACT) framework to integrate these subsets and avoid the domination of the source domain data. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, we explicitly decouple the label supervisions in SSDA into two asymmetric sub-tasks, including semi-supervised learning (SSL) and UDA, and leverage different knowledge from two segmentors to take into account the distinction between the source and target label supervisions. The knowledge learned in the two modules is then adaptively integrated with ACT, by iteratively teaching each other, based on the confidence-aware pseudo-label. In addition, pseudo label noise is well-controlled with an exponential MixUp decay scheme for smooth propagation. Experiments on cross-modality brain tumor MRI segmentation tasks using the BraTS18 database showed, even with limited labeled target samples, ACT yielded marked improvements over UDA and state-of-the-art SSDA methods.      
### 50.E^2VTS: Energy-Efficient Video Text Spotting from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02281.pdf)
>  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based video text spotting has been extensively used in civil and military domains. UAV's limited battery capacity motivates us to develop an energy-efficient video text spotting solution. In this paper, we first revisit RCNN's crop &amp; resize training strategy and empirically find that it outperforms aligned RoI sampling on a real-world video text dataset captured by UAV. To reduce energy consumption, we further propose a multi-stage image processor that takes videos' redundancy, continuity, and mixed degradation into account. Lastly, the model is pruned and quantized before deployed on Raspberry Pi. Our proposed energy-efficient video text spotting solution, dubbed as E^2VTS, outperforms all previous methods by achieving a competitive tradeoff between energy efficiency and performance.

### 51.Estimating Building Energy Efficiency From Street View Imagery, Aerial Imagery, and Land Surface Temperature Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02270.pdf)
>  In the race towards carbon neutrality, the building sector has fallen behind and bears the potential to endanger the progress made across other industries. This is because buildings exhibit a life span of several decades which creates substantial inertia in the face of climate change. This inertia is further exacerbated by the scale of the existing building stock. With several billion operational buildings around the globe, working towards a carbon-neutral building sector requires solutions which enable stakeholders to accurately identify and retrofit subpar buildings at scale. However, improving the energy efficiency of the existing building stock through retrofits in a targeted and efficient way remains challenging. This is because, as of today, the energy efficiency of buildings is generally determined by on-site visits of certified energy auditors which makes the process slow, costly, and geographically incomplete. In order to accelerate the identification of promising retrofit targets, this work proposes a new method which can estimate a building's energy efficiency using purely remotely sensed data such as street view and aerial imagery, OSM-derived footprint areas, and satellite-borne land surface temperature (LST) measurements. We find that in the binary setting of distinguishing efficient from inefficient buildings, our end-to-end deep learning model achieves a macro-averaged F1-score of 62.06\%. As such, this work shows the potential and complementary nature of remotely sensed data in predicting building attributes such as energy efficiency and opens up new opportunities for future work to integrate additional data sources.      
### 52.Towards Individual Grevy's Zebra Identification via Deep 3D Fitting and Metric Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02261.pdf)
>  This paper combines deep learning techniques for species detection, 3D model fitting, and metric learning in one pipeline to perform individual animal identification from photographs by exploiting unique coat patterns. This is the first work to attempt this and, compared to traditional 2D bounding box or segmentation based CNN identification pipelines, the approach provides effective and explicit view-point normalisation and allows for a straight forward visualisation of the learned biometric population space. Note that due to the use of metric learning the pipeline is also readily applicable to open set and zero shot re-identification scenarios. We apply the proposed approach to individual Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) identification and show in a small study on the SMALST dataset that the use of 3D model fitting can indeed benefit performance. In particular, back-projected textures from 3D fitted models improve identification accuracy from 48.0% to 56.8% compared to 2D bounding box approaches for the dataset. Whilst the study is far too small accurately to estimate the full performance potential achievable in larger-scale real-world application settings and in comparisons against polished tools, our work lays the conceptual and practical foundations for a next step in animal biometrics towards deep metric learning driven, fully 3D-aware animal identification in open population settings. We publish network weights and relevant facilitating source code with this paper for full reproducibility and as inspiration for further research.      
### 53.SealID: Saimaa ringed seal re-identification dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02260.pdf)
>  Wildlife camera traps and crowd-sourced image material provide novel possibilities to monitor endangered animal species. However, massive image volumes that these methods produce are overwhelming for researchers to go through manually which calls for automatic systems to perform the analysis. The analysis task that has gained the most attention is the re-identification of individuals, as it allows, for example, to study animal migration or to estimate the population size. The Saimaa ringed seal (Pusa hispida saimensis) is an endangered subspecies only found in the Lake Saimaa, Finland, and is one of the few existing freshwater seal species. Ringed seals have permanent pelage patterns that are unique to each individual which can be used for the identification of individuals. Large variation in poses further exacerbated by the deformable nature of seals together with varying appearance and low contrast between the ring pattern and the rest of the pelage makes the Saimaa ringed seal re-identification task very challenging, providing a good benchmark to evaluate state-of-the-art re-identification methods. Therefore, we make our Saimaa ringed seal image (SealID) dataset (N=57) publicly available for research purposes. In this paper, the dataset is described, the evaluation protocol for re-identification methods is proposed, and the results for two baseline methods HotSpotter and NORPPA are provided. The SealID dataset has been made publicly available.      
### 54.Efficient Annotation and Learning for 3D Hand Pose Estimation: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02257.pdf)
>  In this survey, we present comprehensive analysis of 3D hand pose estimation from the perspective of efficient annotation and learning. In particular, we study recent approaches for 3D hand pose annotation and learning methods with limited annotated data. In 3D hand pose estimation, collecting 3D hand pose annotation is a key step in developing hand pose estimators and their applications, such as video understanding, AR/VR, and robotics. However, acquiring annotated 3D hand poses is cumbersome, e.g., due to the difficulty of accessing 3D information and occlusion. Motivated by elucidating how recent works address the annotation issue, we investigated annotation methods classified as manual, synthetic-model-based, hand-sensor-based, and computational approaches. Since these annotation methods are not always available on a large scale, we examined methods of learning 3D hand poses when we do not have enough annotated data, namely self-supervised pre-training, semi-supervised learning, and domain adaptation. Based on the analysis of these efficient annotation and learning, we further discuss limitations and possible future directions of this field.      
### 55.Two Decades of Bengali Handwritten Digit Recognition: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02234.pdf)
>  Handwritten Digit Recognition (HDR) is one of the most challenging tasks in the domain of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Irrespective of language, there are some inherent challenges of HDR, which mostly arise due to the variations in writing styles across individuals, writing medium and environment, inability to maintain the same strokes while writing any digit repeatedly, etc. In addition to that, the structural complexities of the digits of a particular language may lead to ambiguous scenarios of HDR. Over the years, researchers have developed numerous offline and online HDR pipelines, where different image processing techniques are combined with traditional Machine Learning (ML)-based and/or Deep Learning (DL)-based architectures. Although evidence of extensive review studies on HDR exists in the literature for languages, such as: English, Arabic, Indian, Farsi, Chinese, etc., few surveys on Bengali HDR (BHDR) can be found, which lack a comprehensive analysis of the challenges, the underlying recognition process, and possible future directions. In this paper, the characteristics and inherent ambiguities of Bengali handwritten digits along with a comprehensive insight of two decades of the state-of-the-art datasets and approaches towards offline BHDR have been analyzed. Furthermore, several real-life application-specific studies, which involve BHDR, have also been discussed in detail. This paper will also serve as a compendium for researchers interested in the science behind offline BHDR, instigating the exploration of newer avenues of relevant research that may further lead to better offline recognition of Bengali handwritten digits in different application areas.      
### 56.U(1) Symmetry-breaking Observed in Generic CNN Bottleneck Layers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02220.pdf)
>  We report on a significant discovery linking deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to biological vision and fundamental particle physics. A model of information propagation in a CNN is proposed via an analogy to an optical system, where bosonic particles (i.e. photons) are concentrated as the 2D spatial resolution of the image collapses to a focal point $1\times 1=1$. A 3D space $(x,y,t)$ is defined by $(x,y)$ coordinates in the image plane and CNN layer $t$, where a principal ray $(0,0,t)$ runs in the direction of information propagation through both the optical axis and the image center pixel located at $(x,y)=(0,0)$, about which the sharpest possible spatial focus is limited to a circle of confusion in the image plane. Our novel insight is to model the principal optical ray $(0,0,t)$ as geometrically equivalent to the medial vector in the positive orthant $I(x,y) \in R^{N+}$ of a $N$-channel activation space, e.g. along the greyscale (or luminance) vector $(t,t,t)$ in $RGB$ colour space. Information is thus concentrated into an energy potential $E(x,y,t)=\|I(x,y,t)\|^2$, which, particularly for bottleneck layers $t$ of generic CNNs, is highly concentrated and symmetric about the spatial origin $(0,0,t)$ and exhibits the well-known "Sombrero" potential of the boson particle. This symmetry is broken in classification, where bottleneck layers of generic pre-trained CNN models exhibit a consistent class-specific bias towards an angle $\theta \in U(1)$ defined simultaneously in the image plane and in activation feature space. Initial observations validate our hypothesis from generic pre-trained CNN activation maps and a bare-bones memory-based classification scheme, with no training or tuning. Training from scratch using a random $U(1)$ class label the leads to improved classification in all cases.      
### 57.3D Convolutional with Attention for Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02203.pdf)
>  Human action recognition is one of the challenging tasks in computer vision. The current action recognition methods use computationally expensive models for learning spatio-temporal dependencies of the action. Models utilizing RGB channels and optical flow separately, models using a two-stream fusion technique, and models consisting of both convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) network are few examples of such complex models. Moreover, fine-tuning such complex models is computationally expensive as well. This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture for learning such dependencies consisting of a 3D convolutional layer, fully connected (FC) layers, and attention layer, which is simpler to implement and gives a competitive performance on the UCF-101 dataset. The proposed method first learns spatial and temporal features of actions through 3D-CNN, and then the attention mechanism helps the model to locate attention to essential features for recognition.      
### 58.GridShift: A Faster Mode-seeking Algorithm for Image Segmentation and Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02200.pdf)
>  In machine learning and computer vision, mean shift (MS) qualifies as one of the most popular mode-seeking algorithms used for clustering and image segmentation. It iteratively moves each data point to the weighted mean of its neighborhood data points. The computational cost required to find the neighbors of each data point is quadratic to the number of data points. Consequently, the vanilla MS appears to be very slow for large-scale datasets. To address this issue, we propose a mode-seeking algorithm called GridShift, with significant speedup and principally based on MS. To accelerate, GridShift employs a grid-based approach for neighbor search, which is linear in the number of data points. In addition, GridShift moves the active grid cells (grid cells associated with at least one data point) in place of data points towards the higher density, a step that provides more speedup. The runtime of GridShift is linear in the number of active grid cells and exponential in the number of features. Therefore, it is ideal for large-scale low-dimensional applications such as object tracking and image segmentation. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the superior performance of GridShift compared to other MS-based as well as state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and runtime on benchmark datasets for image segmentation. Finally, we provide a new object-tracking algorithm based on GridShift and show promising results for object tracking compared to CamShift and meanshift++.      
### 59.FOF: Learning Fourier Occupancy Field for Monocular Real-time Human Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02194.pdf)
>  The advent of deep learning has led to significant progress in monocular human reconstruction. However, existing representations, such as parametric models, voxel grids, meshes and implicit neural representations, have difficulties achieving high-quality results and real-time speed at the same time. In this paper, we propose Fourier Occupancy Field (FOF), a novel powerful, efficient and flexible 3D representation, for monocular real-time and accurate human reconstruction. The FOF represents a 3D object with a 2D field orthogonal to the view direction where at each 2D position the occupancy field of the object along the view direction is compactly represented with the first few terms of Fourier series, which retains the topology and neighborhood relation in the 2D domain. A FOF can be stored as a multi-channel image, which is compatible with 2D convolutional neural networks and can bridge the gap between 3D geometries and 2D images. The FOF is very flexible and extensible, e.g., parametric models can be easily integrated into a FOF as a prior to generate more robust results. Based on FOF, we design the first 30+FPS high-fidelity real-time monocular human reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the potential of FOF on both public dataset and real captured data. The code will be released for research purposes.      
### 60.M2FNet: Multi-modal Fusion Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02187.pdf)
>  Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is crucial in developing sympathetic human-machine interaction. In conversational videos, emotion can be present in multiple modalities, i.e., audio, video, and transcript. However, due to the inherent characteristics of these modalities, multi-modal ERC has always been considered a challenging undertaking. Existing ERC research focuses mainly on using text information in a discussion, ignoring the other two modalities. We anticipate that emotion recognition accuracy can be improved by employing a multi-modal approach. Thus, in this study, we propose a Multi-modal Fusion Network (M2FNet) that extracts emotion-relevant features from visual, audio, and text modality. It employs a multi-head attention-based fusion mechanism to combine emotion-rich latent representations of the input data. We introduce a new feature extractor to extract latent features from the audio and visual modality. The proposed feature extractor is trained with a novel adaptive margin-based triplet loss function to learn emotion-relevant features from the audio and visual data. In the domain of ERC, the existing methods perform well on one benchmark dataset but not on others. Our results show that the proposed M2FNet architecture outperforms all other methods in terms of weighted average F1 score on well-known MELD and IEMOCAP datasets and sets a new state-of-the-art performance in ERC.      
### 61.Semi-Supervised Learning for Mars Imagery Classification and Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02180.pdf)
>  With the progress of Mars exploration, numerous Mars image data are collected and need to be analyzed. However, due to the imbalance and distortion of Martian data, the performance of existing computer vision models is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised framework for machine vision on Mars and try to resolve two specific tasks: classification and segmentation. Contrastive learning is a powerful representation learning technique. However, there is too much information overlap between Martian data samples, leading to a contradiction between contrastive learning and Martian data. Our key idea is to reconcile this contradiction with the help of annotations and further take advantage of unlabeled data to improve performance. For classification, we propose to ignore inner-class pairs on labeled data as well as neglect negative pairs on unlabeled data, forming supervised inter-class contrastive learning and unsupervised similarity learning. For segmentation, we extend supervised inter-class contrastive learning into an element-wise mode and use online pseudo labels for supervision on unlabeled areas. Experimental results show that our learning strategies can improve the classification and segmentation models by a large margin and outperform state-of-the-art approaches.      
### 62.MotionCNN: A Strong Baseline for Motion Prediction in Autonomous Driving  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02163.pdf)
>  To plan a safe and efficient route, an autonomous vehicle should anticipate future motions of other agents around it. Motion prediction is an extremely challenging task that recently gained significant attention within the research community. In this work, we present a simple and yet very strong baseline for multimodal motion prediction based purely on Convolutional Neural Networks. While being easy-to-implement, the proposed approach achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods and ranks 3rd on the 2021 Waymo Open Dataset Motion Prediction Challenge. Our source code is publicly available at GitHub      
### 63.Vanilla Feature Distillation for Improving the Accuracy-Robustness Trade-Off in Adversarial Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02158.pdf)
>  Adversarial training has been widely explored for mitigating attacks against deep models. However, most existing works are still trapped in the dilemma between higher accuracy and stronger robustness since they tend to fit a model towards robust features (not easily tampered with by adversaries) while ignoring those non-robust but highly predictive features. To achieve a better robustness-accuracy trade-off, we propose the Vanilla Feature Distillation Adversarial Training (VFD-Adv), which conducts knowledge distillation from a pre-trained model (optimized towards high accuracy) to guide adversarial training towards higher accuracy, i.e., preserving those non-robust but predictive features. More specifically, both adversarial examples and their clean counterparts are forced to be aligned in the feature space by distilling predictive representations from the pre-trained/clean model, while previous works barely utilize predictive features from clean models. Therefore, the adversarial training model is updated towards maximally preserving the accuracy as gaining robustness. A key advantage of our method is that it can be universally adapted to and boost existing works. Exhaustive experiments on various datasets, classification models, and adversarial training algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.      
### 64.HPGNN: Using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Outdoor Point Cloud Processing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02153.pdf)
>  Inspired by recent improvements in point cloud processing for autonomous navigation, we focus on using hierarchical graph neural networks for processing and feature learning over large-scale outdoor LiDAR point clouds. We observe that existing GNN based methods fail to overcome challenges of scale and irregularity of points in outdoor datasets. Addressing the need to preserve structural details while learning over a larger volume efficiently, we propose Hierarchical Point Graph Neural Network (HPGNN). It learns node features at various levels of graph coarseness to extract information. This enables to learn over a large point cloud while retaining fine details that existing point-level graph networks struggle to achieve. Connections between multiple levels enable a point to learn features in multiple scales, in a few iterations. We design HPGNN as a purely GNN-based approach, so that it offers modular expandability as seen with other point-based and Graph network baselines. To illustrate the improved processing capability, we compare previous point based and GNN models for semantic segmentation with our HPGNN, achieving a significant improvement for GNNs (+36.7 mIoU) on the SemanticKITTI dataset.      
### 65.Recurrent Video Restoration Transformer with Guided Deformable Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02146.pdf)
>  Video restoration aims at restoring multiple high-quality frames from multiple low-quality frames. Existing video restoration methods generally fall into two extreme cases, i.e., they either restore all frames in parallel or restore the video frame by frame in a recurrent way, which would result in different merits and drawbacks. Typically, the former has the advantage of temporal information fusion. However, it suffers from large model size and intensive memory consumption; the latter has a relatively small model size as it shares parameters across frames; however, it lacks long-range dependency modeling ability and parallelizability. In this paper, we attempt to integrate the advantages of the two cases by proposing a recurrent video restoration transformer, namely RVRT. RVRT processes local neighboring frames in parallel within a globally recurrent framework which can achieve a good trade-off between model size, effectiveness, and efficiency. Specifically, RVRT divides the video into multiple clips and uses the previously inferred clip feature to estimate the subsequent clip feature. Within each clip, different frame features are jointly updated with implicit feature aggregation. Across different clips, the guided deformable attention is designed for clip-to-clip alignment, which predicts multiple relevant locations from the whole inferred clip and aggregates their features by the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on video super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising show that the proposed RVRT achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with balanced model size, testing memory and runtime.      
### 66.LDRNet: Enabling Real-time Document Localization on Mobile Devices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02136.pdf)
>  While Identity Document Verification (IDV) technology on mobile devices becomes ubiquitous in modern business operations, the risk of identity theft and fraud is increasing. The identity document holder is normally required to participate in an online video interview to circumvent impostors. However, the current IDV process depends on an additional human workforce to support online step-by-step guidance which is inefficient and expensive. The performance of existing AI-based approaches cannot meet the real-time and lightweight demands of mobile devices. In this paper, we address those challenges by designing an edge intelligence-assisted approach for real-time IDV. Aiming at improving the responsiveness of the IDV process, we propose a new document localization model for mobile devices, LDRNet, to Localize the identity Document in Real-time. On the basis of a lightweight backbone network, we build three prediction branches for LDRNet, the corner points prediction, the line borders prediction and the document classification. We design novel supplementary targets, the equal-division points, and use a new loss function named Line Loss, to improve the speed and accuracy of our approach. In addition to the IDV process, LDRNet is an efficient and reliable document localization alternative for all kinds of mobile applications. As a matter of proof, we compare the performance of LDRNet with other popular approaches on localizing general document datasets. The experimental results show that LDRNet runs at a speed up to 790 FPS which is 47x faster, while still achieving comparable Jaccard Index(JI) in single-model and single-scale tests.      
### 67.MPANet: Multi-Patch Attention For Infrared Small Target object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02120.pdf)
>  Infrared small target detection (ISTD) has attracted widespread attention and been applied in various fields. Due to the small size of infrared targets and the noise interference from complex backgrounds, the performance of ISTD using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is restricted. Moreover, the constriant that long-distance dependent features can not be encoded by the vanilla CNNs also impairs the robustness of capturing targets' shapes and locations in complex scenarios. To this end, a multi-patch attention network (MPANet) based on the axial-attention encoder and the multi-scale patch branch (MSPB) structure is proposed. Specially, an axial-attention-improved encoder architecture is designed to highlight the effective features of small targets and suppress background noises. Furthermore, the developed MSPB structure fuses the coarse-grained and fine-grained features from different semantic scales. Extensive experiments on the SIRST dataset show the superiority performance and effectiveness of the proposed MPANet compared to the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 68.ShapePU: A New PU Learning Framework Regularized by Global Consistency for Scribble Supervised Cardiac Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02118.pdf)
>  Cardiac segmentation is an essential step for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, pixel-wise dense labeling is both costly and time-consuming. Scribble, as a form of sparse annotation, is more accessible than full annotations. However, it's particularly challenging to train a segmentation network with weak supervision from scribbles. To tackle this problem, we propose a new scribble-guided method for cardiac segmentation, based on the Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning framework and global consistency regularization, and termed as ShapePU. To leverage unlabeled pixels via PU learning, we first present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the proportion of each class in the unlabeled pixels. Given the estimated ratios, we then introduce the marginal probability maximization to identify the classes of unlabeled pixels. To exploit shape knowledge, we apply cutout operations to training images, and penalize the inconsistent segmentation results. Evaluated on two open datasets, i.e, ACDC and MSCMRseg, our scribble-supervised ShapePU surpassed the fully supervised approach respectively by 1.4% and 9.8% in average Dice, and outperformed the state-of-the-art weakly supervised and PU learning methods by large margins.

### 69.Cannot See the Forest for the Trees: Aggregating Multiple Viewpoints to Better Classify Objects in Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02116.pdf)
>  Recently, both long-tailed recognition and object tracking have made great advances individually. TAO benchmark presented a mixture of the two, long-tailed object tracking, in order to further reflect the aspect of the real-world. To date, existing solutions have adopted detectors showing robustness in long-tailed distributions, which derive per-frame results. Then, they used tracking algorithms that combine the temporally independent detections to finalize tracklets. However, as the approaches did not take temporal changes in scenes into account, inconsistent classification results in videos led to low overall performance. In this paper, we present a set classifier that improves accuracy of classifying tracklets by aggregating information from multiple viewpoints contained in a tracklet. To cope with sparse annotations in videos, we further propose augmentation of tracklets that can maximize data efficiency. The set classifier is plug-and-playable to existing object trackers, and highly improves the performance of long-tailed object tracking. By simply attaching our method to QDTrack on top of ResNet-101, we achieve the new state-of-the-art, 19.9% and 15.7% TrackAP_50 on TAO validation and test sets, respectively.      
### 70.Computer Vision-based Characterization of Large-scale Jet Flames using a Synthetic Infrared Image Generation Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02110.pdf)
>  Among the different kinds of fire accidents that can occur during industrial activities that involve hazardous materials, jet fires are one of the lesser-known types. This is because they are often involved in a process that generates a sequence of other accidents of greater magnitude, known as domino effect. Flame impingement usually causes domino effects, and jet fires present specific features that can significantly increase the probability of this happening. These features become relevant from a risk analysis perspective, making their proper characterization a crucial task. Deep Learning approaches have become extensively used for tasks such as jet fire characterization; however, these methods are heavily dependent on the amount of data and the quality of the labels. Data acquisition of jet fires involve expensive experiments, especially so if infrared imagery is used. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of Generative Adversarial Networks to produce plausible infrared images from visible ones, making experiments less expensive and allowing for other potential applications. The results suggest that it is possible to realistically replicate the results for experiments carried out using both visible and infrared cameras. The obtained results are compared with some previous experiments, and it is shown that similar results were obtained.      
### 71.ContraCLIP: Interpretable GAN generation driven by pairs of contrasting sentences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02104.pdf)
>  This work addresses the problem of discovering non-linear interpretable paths in the latent space of pre-trained GANs in a model-agnostic manner. In the proposed method, the discovery is driven by a set of pairs of natural language sentences with contrasting semantics, named semantic dipoles, that serve as the limits of the interpretation that we require by the trainable latent paths to encode. By using the pre-trained CLIP encoder, the sentences are projected into the vision-language space, where they serve as dipoles, and where RBF-based warping functions define a set of non-linear directional paths, one for each semantic dipole, allowing in this way traversals from one semantic pole to the other. By defining an objective that discovers paths in the latent space of GANs that generate changes along the desired paths in the vision-language embedding space, we provide an intuitive way of controlling the underlying generative factors and address some of the limitations of the state-of-the-art works, namely, that a) they are typically tailored to specific GAN architectures (i.e., StyleGAN), b) they disregard the relative position of the manipulated and the original image in the image embedding and the relative position of the image and the text embeddings, and c) they lead to abrupt image manipulations and quickly arrive at regions of low density and, thus, low image quality, providing limited control of the generative factors. We provide extensive qualitative and quantitative results that demonstrate our claims with two pre-trained GANs, and make the code and the pre-trained models publicly available at: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/chi0tzp/ContraCLIP" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 72.Point-to-Voxel Knowledge Distillation for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02099.pdf)
>  This article addresses the problem of distilling knowledge from a large teacher model to a slim student network for LiDAR semantic segmentation. Directly employing previous distillation approaches yields inferior results due to the intrinsic challenges of point cloud, i.e., sparsity, randomness and varying density. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose the Point-to-Voxel Knowledge Distillation (PVD), which transfers the hidden knowledge from both point level and voxel level. Specifically, we first leverage both the pointwise and voxelwise output distillation to complement the sparse supervision signals. Then, to better exploit the structural information, we divide the whole point cloud into several supervoxels and design a difficulty-aware sampling strategy to more frequently sample supervoxels containing less-frequent classes and faraway objects. On these supervoxels, we propose inter-point and inter-voxel affinity distillation, where the similarity information between points and voxels can help the student model better capture the structural information of the surrounding environment. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular LiDAR segmentation benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes and SemanticKITTI. On both benchmarks, our PVD consistently outperforms previous distillation approaches by a large margin on three representative backbones, i.e., Cylinder3D, SPVNAS and MinkowskiNet. Notably, on the challenging nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets, our method can achieve roughly 75% MACs reduction and 2x speedup on the competitive Cylinder3D model and rank 1st on the SemanticKITTI leaderboard among all published algorithms.

### 73.Accurate Scoliosis Vertebral Landmark Localization on X-ray Images via Shape-constrained Multi-stage Cascaded CNNs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02087.pdf)
>  Vertebral landmark localization is a crucial step for variant spine-related clinical applications, which requires detecting the corner points of 17 vertebrae. However, the neighbor landmarks often disturb each other for the homogeneous appearance of vertebrae, which makes vertebral landmark localization extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose multi-stage cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to split the single task into two sequential steps, i.e., center point localization to roughly locate 17 center points of vertebrae, and corner point localization to find 4 corner points for each vertebra without distracted by others. Landmarks in each step are located gradually from a set of initialized points by regressing offsets via cascaded CNNs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to preserve a shape constraint in offset regression to resist the mutual attraction of vertebrae. We evaluate our method on the AASCE dataset that consists of 609 tight spinal anterior-posterior X-ray images and each image contains 17 vertebrae composed of the thoracic and lumbar spine for spinal shape characterization. Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance of vertebral landmark localization over other state-of-the-arts with the relative error decreasing from 3.2e-3 to 7.2e-4.      
### 74.Towards the Creation of a Nutrition and Food Group Based Image Database  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02086.pdf)
>  Food classification is critical to the analysis of nutrients comprising foods reported in dietary assessment. Advances in mobile and wearable sensors, combined with new image based methods, particularly deep learning based approaches, have shown great promise to improve the accuracy of food classification to assess dietary intake. However, these approaches are data-hungry and their performances are heavily reliant on the quantity and quality of the available datasets for training the food classification model. Existing food image datasets are not suitable for fine-grained food classification and the following nutrition analysis as they lack fine-grained and transparently derived food group based identification which are often provided by trained dietitians with expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a framework to create a nutrition and food group based image database that contains both visual and hierarchical food categorization information to enhance links to the nutrient profile of each food. We design a protocol for linking food group based food codes in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to a food image dataset, and implement a web-based annotation tool for efficient deployment of this protocol.Our proposed method is used to build a nutrition and food group based image database including 16,114 food images representing the 74 most frequently consumed What We Eat in America (WWEIA) food sub-categories in the United States with 1,865 USDA food code matched to a nutrient database, the USDA FNDDS nutrient database.      
### 75.Towards Fast Adaptation of Pretrained Contrastive Models for Multi-channel Video-Language Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02082.pdf)
>  Multi-channel video-language retrieval require models to understand information from different modalities (e.g. video+question, video+speech) and real-world knowledge to correctly link a video with a textual response or query. Fortunately, multimodal contrastive models have been shown to be highly effective at aligning entities in images/videos and text, e.g., CLIP; text contrastive models have been extensively studied recently for their strong ability of producing discriminative sentence embeddings, e.g., SimCSE. Their abilities are exactly needed by multi-channel video-language retrieval. However, it is not clear how to quickly adapt these two lines of models to multi-channel video-language retrieval-style tasks. In this paper, we identify a principled model design space with two axes: how to represent videos and how to fuse video and text information. Based on categorization of recent methods, we investigate the options of representing videos using continuous feature vectors or discrete text tokens; for the fusion method, we explore a multimodal transformer or a pretrained contrastive text model. We extensively evaluate the four combinations on five video-language datasets. We surprisingly find that discrete text tokens coupled with a pretrained contrastive text model yields the best performance. This combination can even outperform state-of-the-art on the iVQA dataset without the additional training on millions of video-language data. Further analysis shows that this is because representing videos as text tokens captures the key visual information with text tokens that are naturally aligned with text models and the text models obtained rich knowledge during contrastive pretraining process. All the empirical analysis we obtain for the four variants establishes a solid foundation for future research on leveraging the rich knowledge of pretrained contrastive models.      
### 76.All One Needs to Know about Priors for Deep Image Restoration and Enhancement: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02070.pdf)
>  Image restoration and enhancement is a process of improving the image quality by removing degradations, such as noise, blur, and resolution degradation. Deep learning (DL) has recently been applied to image restoration and enhancement. Due to its ill-posed property, plenty of works have explored priors to facilitate training deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the importance of priors has not been systematically studied and analyzed by far in the research community. Therefore, this paper serves as the first study that provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements of priors for deep image restoration and enhancement. Our work covers five primary contents: (1) A theoretical analysis of priors for deep image restoration and enhancement; (2) A hierarchical and structural taxonomy of priors commonly used in the DL-based methods; (3) An insightful discussion on each prior regarding its principle, potential, and applications; (4) A summary of crucial problems by highlighting the potential future directions to spark more research in the community; (5) An open-source repository that provides a taxonomy of all mentioned works and code links.      
### 77.PIDNet: A Real-time Semantic Segmentation Network Inspired from PID Controller  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02066.pdf)
>  Two-branch network architecture has shown its efficiency and effectiveness for real-time semantic segmentation tasks. However, direct fusion of low-level details and high-level semantics will lead to a phenomenon that the detailed features are easily overwhelmed by surrounding contextual information, namely overshoot in this paper, which limits the improvement of the accuracy of existed two-branch models. In this paper, we bridge a connection between Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and reveal that the two-branch network is nothing but a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, which inherently suffers from the similar overshoot issue. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel three-branch network architecture: PIDNet, which possesses three branches to parse the detailed, context and boundary information (derivative of semantics), respectively, and employs boundary attention to guide the fusion of detailed and context branches in final stage. The family of PIDNets achieve the best trade-off between inference speed and accuracy and their test accuracy surpasses all the existed models with similar inference speed on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCO-Stuff datasets. Especially, PIDNet-S achieves 78.6% mIOU with inference speed of 93.2 FPS on Cityscapes test set and 81.6% mIOU with speed of 153.7 FPS on CamVid test set.      
### 78.Learning Speaker-specific Lip-to-Speech Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02050.pdf)
>  Understanding the lip movement and inferring the speech from it is notoriously difficult for the common person. The task of accurate lip-reading gets help from various cues of the speaker and its contextual or environmental setting. Every speaker has a different accent and speaking style, which can be inferred from their visual and speech features. This work aims to understand the correlation/mapping between speech and the sequence of lip movement of individual speakers in an unconstrained and large vocabulary. We model the frame sequence as a prior to the transformer in an auto-encoder setting and learned a joint embedding that exploits temporal properties of both audio and video. We learn temporal synchronization using deep metric learning, which guides the decoder to generate speech in sync with input lip movements. The predictive posterior thus gives us the generated speech in speaker speaking style. We have trained our model on the Grid and Lip2Wav Chemistry lecture dataset to evaluate single speaker natural speech generation tasks from lip movement in an unconstrained natural setting. Extensive evaluation using various qualitative and quantitative metrics with human evaluation also shows that our method outperforms the Lip2Wav Chemistry dataset(large vocabulary in an unconstrained setting) by a good margin across almost all evaluation metrics and marginally outperforms the state-of-the-art on GRID dataset.      
### 79.Guided Deep Metric Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02029.pdf)
>  Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods have been proven relevant for visual similarity learning. However, they sometimes lack generalization properties because they are trained often using an inappropriate sample selection strategy or due to the difficulty of the dataset caused by a distributional shift in the data. These represent a significant drawback when attempting to learn the underlying data manifold. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop better ways of obtaining generalization and representation of the underlying manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to DML that we call Guided Deep Metric Learning, a novel architecture oriented to learning more compact clusters, improving generalization under distributional shifts in DML. This novel architecture consists of two independent models: A multi-branch master model, inspired from a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) perspective, generates a reduced hypothesis space based on prior knowledge from labeled data, which guides or regularizes the decision boundary of a student model during training under an offline knowledge distillation scheme. Experiments have shown that the proposed method is capable of a better manifold generalization and representation to up to 40% improvement (Recall@1, CIFAR10), using guidelines suggested by Musgrave et al. to perform a more fair and realistic comparison, which is currently absent in the literature      
### 80.Implicit Neural Representation for Mesh-Free Inverse Obstacle Scattering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02027.pdf)
>  Implicit representation of shapes as level sets of multilayer perceptrons has recently flourished in different shape analysis, compression, and reconstruction tasks. In this paper, we introduce an implicit neural representation-based framework for solving the inverse obstacle scattering problem in a mesh-free fashion. We efficiently express the obstacle shape as the zero-level set of a signed distance function which is implicitly determined by a small number of network parameters. To solve the direct scattering problem, we implement the implicit boundary integral method. It uses projections of the grid points in the tubular neighborhood onto the boundary to compute the PDE solution instead of a grid-size-dependent extraction method of surface points such as Marching Cubes. The implicit representation conveniently handles the shape perturbation in the optimization process. To update the shape, we use PyTorch's automatic differentiation to backpropagate the loss function w.r.t. the network parameters, allowing us to avoid complex and error-prone manual derivation of the shape derivative. The proposed framework makes the inverse scattering problem more tractable with fewer parameters to optimize in comparison to the memory-inefficient grid-based approaches and outputs high-quality reconstruction results.      
### 81.APES: Articulated Part Extraction from Sprite Sheets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02015.pdf)
>  Rigged puppets are one of the most prevalent representations to create 2D character animations. Creating these puppets requires partitioning characters into independently moving parts. In this work, we present a method to automatically identify such articulated parts from a small set of character poses shown in a sprite sheet, which is an illustration of the character that artists often draw before puppet creation. Our method is trained to infer articulated parts, e.g. head, torso and limbs, that can be re-assembled to best reconstruct the given poses. Our results demonstrate significantly better performance than alternatives qualitatively and quantitatively.Our project page <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://zhan-xu.github.io/parts/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> includes our code and data.

### 83.MSR: Making Self-supervised learning Robust to Aggressive Augmentations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01999.pdf)
>  Most recent self-supervised learning methods learn visual representation by contrasting different augmented views of images. Compared with supervised learning, more aggressive augmentations have been introduced to further improve the diversity of training pairs. However, aggressive augmentations may distort images' structures leading to a severe semantic shift problem that augmented views of the same image may not share the same semantics, thus degrading the transfer performance. To address this problem, we propose a new SSL paradigm, which counteracts the impact of semantic shift by balancing the role of weak and aggressively augmented pairs. Specifically, semantically inconsistent pairs are of minority and we treat them as noisy pairs. Note that deep neural networks (DNNs) have a crucial memorization effect that DNNs tend to first memorize clean (majority) examples before overfitting to noisy (minority) examples. Therefore, we set a relatively large weight for aggressively augmented data pairs at the early learning stage. With the training going on, the model begins to overfit noisy pairs. Accordingly, we gradually reduce the weights of aggressively augmented pairs. In doing so, our method can better embrace the aggressive augmentations and neutralize the semantic shift problem. Experiments show that our model achieves 73.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50 for 200 epochs, which is a 2.5% improvement over BYOL. Moreover, experiments also demonstrate that the learned representations can transfer well for various downstream tasks.      
### 84.CAINNFlow: Convolutional block Attention modules and Invertible Neural Networks Flow for anomaly detection and localization tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01992.pdf)
>  Detection of object anomalies is crucial in industrial processes, but unsupervised anomaly detection and localization is particularly important due to the difficulty of obtaining a large number of defective samples and the unpredictable types of anomalies in real life. Among the existing unsupervised anomaly detection and localization methods, the NF-based scheme has achieved better results. However, the two subnets (complex functions) $s_{i}(u_{i})$ and $t_{i}(u_{i})$ in NF are usually multilayer perceptrons, which need to squeeze the input visual features from 2D flattening to 1D, destroying the spatial location relationship in the feature map and losing the spatial structure information. In order to retain and effectively extract spatial structure information, we design in this study a complex function model with alternating CBAM embedded in a stacked $3\times3$ full convolution, which is able to retain and effectively extract spatial structure information in the normalized flow model. Extensive experimental results on the MVTec AD dataset show that CAINNFlow achieves advanced levels of accuracy and inference efficiency based on CNN and Transformer backbone networks as feature extractors, and CAINNFlow achieves a pixel-level AUC of $98.64\%$ for anomaly detection in MVTec AD.      
### 85.Cross-modal Clinical Graph Transformer for Ophthalmic Report Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01988.pdf)
>  Automatic generation of ophthalmic reports using data-driven neural networks has great potential in clinical practice. When writing a report, ophthalmologists make inferences with prior clinical knowledge. This knowledge has been neglected in prior medical report generation methods. To endow models with the capability of incorporating expert knowledge, we propose a Cross-modal clinical Graph Transformer (CGT) for ophthalmic report generation (ORG), in which clinical relation triples are injected into the visual features as prior knowledge to drive the decoding procedure. However, two major common Knowledge Noise (KN) issues may affect models' effectiveness. 1) Existing general biomedical knowledge bases such as the UMLS may not align meaningfully to the specific context and language of the report, limiting their utility for knowledge injection. 2) Incorporating too much knowledge may divert the visual features from their correct meaning. To overcome these limitations, we design an automatic information extraction scheme based on natural language processing to obtain clinical entities and relations directly from in-domain training reports. Given a set of ophthalmic images, our CGT first restores a sub-graph from the clinical graph and injects the restored triples into visual features. Then visible matrix is employed during the encoding procedure to limit the impact of knowledge. Finally, reports are predicted by the encoded cross-modal features via a Transformer decoder. Extensive experiments on the large-scale FFA-IR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed CGT is able to outperform previous benchmark methods and achieve state-of-the-art performances.      
### 86.Rethinking the Openness of CLIP  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01986.pdf)
>  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated great potential in realizing open-vocabulary image classification in a matching style, because of its holistic use of natural language supervision that covers unconstrained real-world visual concepts. However, it is, in turn, also difficult to evaluate and analyze the openness of CLIP-like models, since they are in theory open to any vocabulary but the actual accuracy varies. To address the insufficiency of conventional studies on openness, we resort to an incremental view and define the extensibility, which essentially approximates the model's ability to deal with new visual concepts, by evaluating openness through vocabulary expansions. Our evaluation based on extensibility shows that CLIP-like models are hardly truly open and their performances degrade as the vocabulary expands to different degrees. Further analysis reveals that the over-estimation of openness is not because CLIP-like models fail to capture the general similarity of image and text features of novel visual concepts, but because of the confusion among competing text features, that is, they are not stable with respect to the vocabulary. In light of this, we propose to improve the openness of CLIP from the perspective of feature space by enforcing the distinguishability of text features. Our method retrieves relevant texts from the pre-training corpus to enhance prompts for inference, which boosts the extensibility and stability of CLIP even without fine-tuning.      
### 87.C$^3$Fusion: Consistent Contrastive Colon Fusion, Towards Deep SLAM in Colonoscopy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01961.pdf)
>  3D colon reconstruction from Optical Colonoscopy (OC) to detect non-examined surfaces remains an unsolved problem. The challenges arise from the nature of optical colonoscopy data, characterized by highly reflective low-texture surfaces, drastic illumination changes and frequent tracking loss. Recent methods demonstrate compelling results, but suffer from: (1) frangible frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation resulting in many tracking failures; or (2) rely on point-based representations at the cost of scan quality. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction framework that addresses these issues end to end, which result in both quantitatively and qualitatively accurate and robust 3D colon reconstruction. Our SLAM approach, which employs correspondences based on contrastive deep features, and deep consistent depth maps, estimates globally optimized poses, is able to recover from frequent tracking failures, and estimates a global consistent 3D model; all within a single framework. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation on multiple synthetic and real colonoscopy videos, showing high-quality results and comparisons against relevant baselines.      
### 88.Occlusion-Resistant Instance Segmentation of Piglets in Farrowing Pens Using Center Clustering Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01942.pdf)
>  Computer vision enables the development of new approaches to monitor the behavior, health, and welfare of animals. Instance segmentation is a high-precision method in computer vision for detecting individual animals of interest. This method can be used for in-depth analysis of animals, such as examining their subtle interactive behaviors, from videos and images. However, existing deep-learning-based instance segmentation methods have been mostly developed based on public datasets, which largely omit heavy occlusion problems; therefore, these methods have limitations in real-world applications involving object occlusions, such as farrowing pen systems used on pig farms in which the farrowing crates often impede the sow and piglets. In this paper, we propose a novel occlusion-resistant Center Clustering Network for instance segmentation, dubbed as CClusnet-Inseg. Specifically, CClusnet-Inseg uses each pixel to predict object centers and trace these centers to form masks based on clustering results, which consists of a network for segmentation and center offset vector map, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, Centers-to-Mask (C2M) and Remain-Centers-to-Mask (RC2M) algorithms, and a pseudo-occlusion generator (POG). In all, 4,600 images were extracted from six videos collected from six farrowing pens to train and validate our method. CClusnet-Inseg achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 83.6; it outperformed YOLACT++ and Mask R-CNN, which had mAP values of 81.2 and 74.7, respectively. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of core modules of our method. In addition, we apply CClusnet-Inseg to multi-object tracking for animal monitoring, and the predicted object center that is a conjunct output could serve as an occlusion-resistant representation of the location of an object.      
### 89.From Pixels to Objects: Cubic Visual Attention for Visual Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01923.pdf)
>  Recently, attention-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) has achieved great success by utilizing question to selectively target different visual areas that are related to the answer. Existing visual attention models are generally planar, i.e., different channels of the last conv-layer feature map of an image share the same weight. This conflicts with the attention mechanism because CNN features are naturally spatial and channel-wise. Also, visual attention models are usually conducted on pixel-level, which may cause region discontinuous problems. In this paper, we propose a Cubic Visual Attention (CVA) model by successfully applying a novel channel and spatial attention on object regions to improve VQA task. Specifically, instead of attending to pixels, we first take advantage of the object proposal networks to generate a set of object candidates and extract their associated conv features. Then, we utilize the question to guide channel attention and spatial attention calculation based on the con-layer feature map. Finally, the attended visual features and the question are combined to infer the answer. We assess the performance of our proposed CVA on three public image QA datasets, including COCO-QA, VQA and Visual7W. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts.      
### 90.Nerfels: Renderable Neural Codes for Improved Camera Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01916.pdf)
>  This paper presents a framework that combines traditional keypoint-based camera pose optimization with an invertible neural rendering mechanism. Our proposed 3D scene representation, Nerfels, is locally dense yet globally sparse. As opposed to existing invertible neural rendering systems which overfit a model to the entire scene, we adopt a feature-driven approach for representing scene-agnostic, local 3D patches with renderable codes. By modelling a scene only where local features are detected, our framework effectively generalizes to unseen local regions in the scene via an optimizable code conditioning mechanism in the neural renderer, all while maintaining the low memory footprint of a sparse 3D map representation. Our model can be incorporated to existing state-of-the-art hand-crafted and learned local feature pose estimators, yielding improved performance when evaluating on ScanNet for wide camera baseline scenarios.      
### 91.The Spike Gating Flow: A Hierarchical Structure Based Spiking Neural Network for Online Gesture Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01910.pdf)
>  Action recognition is an exciting research avenue for artificial intelligence since it may be a game changer in the emerging industrial fields such as robotic visions and automobiles. However, current deep learning faces major challenges for such applications because of the huge computational cost and the inefficient learning. Hence, we develop a novel brain-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based system titled Spiking Gating Flow (SGF) for online action learning. The developed system consists of multiple SGF units which assembled in a hierarchical manner. A single SGF unit involves three layers: a feature extraction layer, an event-driven layer and a histogram-based training layer. To demonstrate the developed system capabilities, we employ a standard Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) gesture classification as a benchmark. The results indicate that we can achieve 87.5% accuracy which is comparable with Deep Learning (DL), but at smaller training/inference data number ratio 1.5:1. And only a single training epoch is required during the learning process. Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest accuracy among the non-backpropagation algorithm based SNNs. At last, we conclude the few-shot learning paradigm of the developed network: 1) a hierarchical structure-based network design involves human prior knowledge; 2) SNNs for content based global dynamic feature detection.      
### 92.Video-based Human-Object Interaction Detection from Tubelet Tokens  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01908.pdf)
>  We present a novel vision Transformer, named TUTOR, which is able to learn tubelet tokens, served as highly-abstracted spatiotemporal representations, for video-based human-object interaction (V-HOI) detection. The tubelet tokens structurize videos by agglomerating and linking semantically-related patch tokens along spatial and temporal domains, which enjoy two benefits: 1) Compactness: each tubelet token is learned by a selective attention mechanism to reduce redundant spatial dependencies from others; 2) Expressiveness: each tubelet token is enabled to align with a semantic instance, i.e., an object or a human, across frames, thanks to agglomeration and linking. The effectiveness and efficiency of TUTOR are verified by extensive experiments. Results shows our method outperforms existing works by large margins, with a relative mAP gain of $16.14\%$ on VidHOI and a 2 points gain on CAD-120 as well as a $4 \times$ speedup.      
### 93.A Superimposed Divide-and-Conquer Image Recognition Method for SEM Images of Nanoparticles on The Surface of Monocrystalline silicon with High Aggregation Degree  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01884.pdf)
>  The nanoparticle size and distribution information in the SEM images of silicon crystals are generally counted by manual methods. The realization of automatic machine recognition is significant in materials science. This paper proposed a superposition partitioning image recognition method to realize automatic recognition and information statistics of silicon crystal nanoparticle SEM images. Especially for the complex and highly aggregated characteristics of silicon crystal particle size, an accurate recognition step and contour statistics method based on morphological processing are given. This method has technical reference value for the recognition of Monocrystalline silicon surface nanoparticle images under different SEM shooting conditions. Besides, it outperforms other methods in terms of recognition accuracy and algorithm efficiency.      
### 94.Face Recognition Accuracy Across Demographics: Shining a Light Into the Problem  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01881.pdf)
>  This is the first work that we are aware of to explore how the level of brightness of the skin region in a pair of face images impacts face recognition accuracy. Image pairs with both images having mean face skin brightness in an upper-middle range of brightness are found to have the highest matching accuracy across demographics and matchers. Image pairs with both images having mean face skin brightness that is too dark or too light are found to have an increased false match rate (FMR). Image pairs with strongly different face skin brightness are found to have decreased FMR and increased false non-match rate (FNMR). Using a brightness information metric that captures the variation in brightness in the face skin region, the variation in matching accuracy is shown to correlate with the level of information available in the face skin region. For operational scenarios where image acquisition is controlled, we propose acquiring images with lighting adjusted to yield face skin brightness in a narrow range.      
### 95.SPGNet: Spatial Projection Guided 3D Human Pose Estimation in Low Dimensional Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01867.pdf)
>  We propose a method SPGNet for 3D human pose estimation that mixes multi-dimensional re-projection into supervised learning. In this method, the 2D-to-3D-lifting network predicts the global position and coordinates of the 3D human pose. Then, we re-project the estimated 3D pose back to the 2D key points along with spatial adjustments. The loss functions compare the estimated 3D pose with the 3D pose ground truth, and re-projected 2D pose with the input 2D pose. In addition, we propose a kinematic constraint to restrict the predicted target with constant human bone length. Based on the estimation results for the dataset Human3.6M, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.      
### 96.Recurrent Image Registration using Mutual Attention based Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01863.pdf)
>  Image registration is an important task in medical imaging which estimates the spatial transformation between different images. Many previous studies have used learning-based methods for multi-stage registration to perform 3D image registration to improve performance. The performance of the multi-stage approach, however, is limited by the size of the receptive field where complex motion does not occur at a single spatial scale. We propose a new registration network combining recursive network architecture and mutual attention mechanism to overcome these limitations. Compared with the previous deep learning methods, our network based on the recursive structure achieves the highest accuracy in lung Computed Tomography (CT) data set (Dice score of 92\% and average surface distance of 3.8mm for lungs) and one of the most accurate results in abdominal CT data set with 9 organs of various sizes (Dice score of 55\% and average surface distance of 7.8mm). We also showed that adding 3 recursive networks is sufficient to achieve the state-of-the-art results without a significant increase in the inference time.      
### 97.Poisson2Sparse: Self-Supervised Poisson Denoising From a Single Image  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01856.pdf)
>  Image enhancement approaches often assume that the noise is signal independent, and approximate the degradation model as zero-mean additive Gaussian noise. However, this assumption does not hold for biomedical imaging systems where sensor-based sources of noise are proportional to signal strengths, and the noise is better represented as a Poisson process. In this work, we explore a sparsity and dictionary learning-based approach and present a novel self-supervised learning method for single-image denoising where the noise is approximated as a Poisson process, requiring no clean ground-truth data. Specifically, we approximate traditional iterative optimization algorithms for image denoising with a recurrent neural network which enforces sparsity with respect to the weights of the network. Since the sparse representations are based on the underlying image, it is able to suppress the spurious components (noise) in the image patches, thereby introducing implicit regularization for denoising task through the network structure. Experiments on two bio-imaging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of PSNR and SSIM. Our qualitative results demonstrate that, in addition to higher performance on standard quantitative metrics, we are able to recover much more subtle details than other compared approaches.      
### 98.Visual Clues: Bridging Vision and Language Foundations for Image Paragraph Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01843.pdf)
>  People say, "A picture is worth a thousand words". Then how can we get the rich information out of the image? We argue that by using visual clues to bridge large pretrained vision foundation models and language models, we can do so without any extra cross-modal training. Thanks to the strong zero-shot capability of foundation models, we start by constructing a rich semantic representation of the image (e.g., image tags, object attributes / locations, captions) as a structured textual prompt, called visual clues, using a vision foundation model. Based on visual clues, we use large language model to produce a series of comprehensive descriptions for the visual content, which is then verified by the vision model again to select the candidate that aligns best with the image. We evaluate the quality of generated descriptions by quantitative and qualitative measurement. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of such a structured semantic representation.      
### 99.Coffee Roast Intelligence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01841.pdf)
>  As the coffee industry has grown, there would be more demand for roasted coffee beans, as well as increased rivalry for selling coffee and attracting customers. As the flavor of each variety of coffee is dependent on the degree of roasting of the coffee beans, it is vital to maintain a consistent quality related to the degree of roasting. Each barista has their own method for determining the degree of roasting. However, extrinsic circumstances such as light, fatigue, and other factors may alter their judgment. As a result, the quality of the coffee cannot be controlled. The Coffee Roast Intelligence application is a machine learning-based study of roasted coffee bean degrees classification produced as an Android application platform that identifies the color of coffee beans by photographing or uploading them while roasting. This application displays the text showing at what level the coffee beans have been roasted, as well as informs the percent chance of class prediction to the consumers. Users may also keep track of the result of the predictions related to the roasting level of coffee beans.      
### 100.Spatial Feature Mapping for 6DoF Object Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01831.pdf)
>  This work aims to estimate 6Dof (6D) object pose in background clutter. Considering the strong occlusion and background noise, we propose to utilize the spatial structure for better tackling this challenging task. Observing that the 3D mesh can be naturally abstracted by a graph, we build the graph using 3D points as vertices and mesh connections as edges. We construct the corresponding mapping from 2D image features to 3D points for filling the graph and fusion of the 2D and 3D features. Afterward, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is applied to help the feature exchange among objects' points in 3D space. To address the problem of rotation symmetry ambiguity for objects, a spherical convolution is utilized and the spherical features are combined with the convolutional features that are mapped to the graph. Predefined 3D keypoints are voted and the 6DoF pose is obtained via the fitting optimization. Two scenarios of inference, one with the depth information and the other without it are discussed. Tested on the datasets of YCB-Video and LINEMOD, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.      
### 101.EAANet: Efficient Attention Augmented Convolutional Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01821.pdf)
>  Humans can effectively find salient regions in complex scenes. Self-attention mechanisms were introduced into Computer Vision (CV) to achieve this. Attention Augmented Convolutional Network (AANet) is a mixture of convolution and self-attention, which increases the accuracy of a typical ResNet. However, The complexity of self-attention is O(n2) in terms of computation and memory usage with respect to the number of input tokens. In this project, we propose EAANet: Efficient Attention Augmented Convolutional Networks, which incorporates efficient self-attention mechanisms in a convolution and self-attention hybrid architecture to reduce the model's memory footprint. Our best model show performance improvement over AA-Net and ResNet18. We also explore different methods to augment Convolutional Network with self-attention mechanisms and show the difficulty of training those methods compared to ResNet. Finally, we show that augmenting efficient self-attention mechanisms with ResNet scales better with input size than normal self-attention mechanisms. Therefore, our EAANet is more capable of working with high-resolution images.      
### 102.Learning sRGB-to-Raw-RGB De-rendering with Content-Aware Metadata  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01813.pdf)
>  Most camera images are rendered and saved in the standard RGB (sRGB) format by the camera's hardware. Due to the in-camera photo-finishing routines, nonlinear sRGB images are undesirable for computer vision tasks that assume a direct relationship between pixel values and scene radiance. For such applications, linear raw-RGB sensor images are preferred. Saving images in their raw-RGB format is still uncommon due to the large storage requirement and lack of support by many imaging applications. Several "raw reconstruction" methods have been proposed that utilize specialized metadata sampled from the raw-RGB image at capture time and embedded in the sRGB image. This metadata is used to parameterize a mapping function to de-render the sRGB image back to its original raw-RGB format when needed. Existing raw reconstruction methods rely on simple sampling strategies and global mapping to perform the de-rendering. This paper shows how to improve the de-rendering results by jointly learning sampling and reconstruction. Our experiments show that our learned sampling can adapt to the image content to produce better raw reconstructions than existing methods. We also describe an online fine-tuning strategy for the reconstruction network to improve results further.      
### 103.Additive MIL: Intrinsic Interpretability for Pathology  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01794.pdf)
>  Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely applied in pathology towards solving critical problems such as automating cancer diagnosis and grading, predicting patient prognosis, and therapy response. Deploying these models in a clinical setting requires careful inspection of these black boxes during development and deployment to identify failures and maintain physician trust. In this work, we propose a simple formulation of MIL models, which enables interpretability while maintaining similar predictive performance. Our Additive MIL models enable spatial credit assignment such that the contribution of each region in the image can be exactly computed and visualized. We show that our spatial credit assignment coincides with regions used by pathologists during diagnosis and improves upon classical attention heatmaps from attention MIL models. We show that any existing MIL model can be made additive with a simple change in function composition. We also show how these models can debug model failures, identify spurious features, and highlight class-wise regions of interest, enabling their use in high-stakes environments such as clinical decision-making.      
### 104.Real-Time Super-Resolution for Real-World Images on Mobile Devices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01777.pdf)
>  Image Super-Resolution (ISR), which aims at recovering High-Resolution (HR) images from the corresponding Low-Resolution (LR) counterparts. Although recent progress in ISR has been remarkable. However, they are way too computationally intensive to be deployed on edge devices, since most of the recent approaches are deep learning-based. Besides, these methods always fail in real-world scenes, since most of them adopt a simple fixed "ideal" bicubic downsampling kernel from high-quality images to construct LR/HR training pairs which may lose track of frequency-related details. In this work, an approach for real-time ISR on mobile devices is presented, which is able to deal with a wide range of degradations in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on traditional super-resolution datasets (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Manga109, DIV2K) and real-world images with a variety of degradations demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-art methods, resulting in higher PSNR and SSIM, lower noise and better visual quality. Most importantly, our method achieves real-time performance on mobile or edge devices.      
### 105.Radar Guided Dynamic Visual Attention for Resource-Efficient RGB Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01772.pdf)
>  An autonomous system's perception engine must provide an accurate understanding of the environment for it to make decisions. Deep learning based object detection networks experience degradation in the performance and robustness for small and far away objects due to a reduction in object's feature map as we move to higher layers of the network. In this work, we propose a novel radar-guided spatial attention for RGB images to improve the perception quality of autonomous vehicles operating in a dynamic environment. In particular, our method improves the perception of small and long range objects, which are often not detected by the object detectors in RGB mode. The proposed method consists of two RGB object detectors, namely the Primary detector and a lightweight Secondary detector. The primary detector takes a full RGB image and generates primary detections. Next, the radar proposal framework creates regions of interest (ROIs) for object proposals by projecting the radar point cloud onto the 2D RGB image. These ROIs are cropped and fed to the secondary detector to generate secondary detections which are then fused with the primary detections via non-maximum suppression. This method helps in recovering the small objects by preserving the object's spatial features through an increase in their receptive field. We evaluate our fusion method on the challenging nuScenes dataset and show that our fusion method with SSD-lite as primary and secondary detector improves the baseline primary yolov3 detector's recall by 14% while requiring three times fewer computational resources.

>  Currently, weed control in a corn field is performed by a blanket application of herbicides that do not consider spatial distribution information of weeds and also uses an extensive amount of chemical herbicides. To reduce the amount of chemicals, we used drone-based high-resolution imagery and computer-vision techniques to perform site-specific weed control in corn.      
### 107.Adversarial RAW: Image-Scaling Attack Against Imaging Pipeline  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01733.pdf)
>  Deep learning technologies have become the backbone for the development of computer vision. With further explorations, deep neural networks have been found vulnerable to well-designed adversarial attacks. Most of the vision devices are equipped with image signal processing (ISP) pipeline to implement RAW-to-RGB transformations and embedded into data preprocessing module for efficient image processing. Actually, ISP pipeline can introduce adversarial behaviors to post-capture images while data preprocessing may destroy attack patterns. However, none of the existing adversarial attacks takes into account the impacts of both ISP pipeline and data preprocessing. In this paper, we develop an image-scaling attack targeting on ISP pipeline, where the crafted adversarial RAW can be transformed into attack image that presents entirely different appearance once being scaled to a specific-size image. We first consider the gradient-available ISP pipeline, i.e., the gradient information can be directly used in the generation process of adversarial RAW to launch the attack. To make the adversarial attack more applicable, we further consider the gradient-unavailable ISP pipeline, in which a proxy model that well learns the RAW-to-RGB transformations is proposed as the gradient oracles. Extensive experiments show that the proposed adversarial attacks can craft adversarial RAW data against the target ISP pipelines with high attack rates.      
### 108.Compound Multi-branch Feature Fusion for Real Image Restoration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02748.pdf)
>  Image restoration is a challenging and ill-posed problem which also has been a long-standing issue. However, most of learning based restoration methods are proposed to target one degradation type which means they are lack of generalization. In this paper, we proposed a multi-branch restoration model inspired from the Human Visual System (i.e., Retinal Ganglion Cells) which can achieve multiple restoration tasks in a general framework. The experiments show that the proposed multi-branch architecture, called CMFNet, has competitive performance results on four datasets, including image dehazing, deraindrop, and deblurring, which are very common applications for autonomous cars. The source code and pretrained models of three restoration tasks are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/FanChiMao/CMFNet" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 109.Canonical Cortical Graph Neural Networks and its Application for Speech Enhancement in Future Audio-Visual Hearing Aids  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02671.pdf)
>  Despite the recent success of machine learning algorithms, most of these models still face several drawbacks when considering more complex tasks requiring interaction between different sources, such as multimodal input data and logical time sequence. On the other hand, the biological brain is highly sharpened in this sense, empowered to automatically manage and integrate such a stream of information through millions of years of evolution. In this context, this paper finds inspiration from recent discoveries on cortical circuits in the brain to propose a more biologically plausible self-supervised machine learning approach that combines multimodal information using intra-layer modulations together with canonical correlation analysis (CCA), as well as a memory mechanism to keep track of temporal data, the so-called Canonical Cortical Graph Neural networks. The approach outperformed recent state-of-the-art results considering both better clean audio reconstruction and energy efficiency, described by a reduced and smother neuron firing rate distribution, suggesting the model as a suitable approach for speech enhancement in future audio-visual hearing aid devices.      
### 110.Robust Fine-Tuning of Deep Neural Networks with Hessian-based Generalization Guarantees  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02659.pdf)
>  We consider transfer learning approaches that fine-tune a pretrained deep neural network on a target task. We investigate generalization properties of fine-tuning to understand the problem of overfitting, which often happens in practice. Previous works have shown that constraining the distance from the initialization of fine-tuning improves generalization. Using a PAC-Bayesian analysis, we observe that besides distance from initialization, Hessians affect generalization through the noise stability of deep neural networks against noise injections. Motivated by the observation, we develop Hessian distance-based generalization bounds for a wide range of fine-tuning methods. Next, we investigate the robustness of fine-tuning with noisy labels. We design an algorithm that incorporates consistent losses and distance-based regularization for fine-tuning. Additionally, we prove a generalization error bound of our algorithm under class conditional independent noise in the training dataset labels. We perform a detailed empirical study of our algorithm on various noisy environments and architectures. For example, on six image classification tasks whose training labels are generated with programmatic labeling, we show a 3.26% accuracy improvement over prior methods. Meanwhile, the Hessian distance measure of the fine-tuned network using our algorithm decreases by six times more than existing approaches.      
### 111.On the duality between contrastive and non-contrastive self-supervised learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02574.pdf)
>  Recent approaches in self-supervised learning of image representations can be categorized into different families of methods and, in particular, can be divided into contrastive and non-contrastive approaches. While differences between the two families have been thoroughly discussed to motivate new approaches, we focus more on the theoretical similarities between them. By designing contrastive and non-contrastive criteria that can be related algebraically and shown to be equivalent under limited assumptions, we show how close those families can be. We further study popular methods and introduce variations of them, allowing us to relate this theoretical result to current practices and show how design choices in the criterion can influence the optimization process and downstream performance. We also challenge the popular assumptions that contrastive and non-contrastive methods, respectively, need large batch sizes and output dimensions. Our theoretical and quantitative results suggest that the numerical gaps between contrastive and noncontrastive methods in certain regimes can be significantly reduced given better network design choice and hyperparameter tuning.      
### 112.Binding Dancers Into Attractors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02558.pdf)
>  To effectively perceive and process observations in our environment, feature binding and perspective taking are crucial cognitive abilities. Feature binding combines observed features into one entity, called a Gestalt. Perspective taking transfers the percept into a canonical, observer-centered frame of reference. Here we propose a recurrent neural network model that solves both challenges. We first train an LSTM to predict 3D motion dynamics from a canonical perspective. We then present similar motion dynamics with novel viewpoints and feature arrangements. Retrospective inference enables the deduction of the canonical perspective. Combined with a robust mutual-exclusive softmax selection scheme, random feature arrangements are reordered and precisely bound into known Gestalt percepts. To corroborate evidence for the architecture's cognitive validity, we examine its behavior on the silhouette illusion, which elicits two competitive Gestalt interpretations of a rotating dancer. Our system flexibly binds the information of the rotating figure into the alternative attractors resolving the illusion's ambiguity and imagining the respective depth interpretation and the corresponding direction of rotation. We finally discuss the potential universality of the proposed mechanisms.      
### 113.Single pixel imaging at high pixel resolutions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02510.pdf)
>  The usually reported pixel resolution of single pixel imaging (SPI) varies between $32 \times 32$ and $256 \times 256$ pixels falling far below imaging standards with classical methods. Low resolution results from the trade-off between the acceptable compression ratio, the limited DMD modulation frequency, and reasonable reconstruction time, and has not improved significantly during the decade of intensive research on SPI. In this paper we show that image measurement at the full resolution of the DMD, which lasts only a fraction of a second, is possible for sparse images or in a situation when the field of view is limited but is a priori unknown. We propose the sampling and reconstruction strategies that enable us to reconstruct sparse images at the resolution of $1024 \times 768$ within the time of $0.3~$s. Non-sparse images are reconstructed with less details. The compression ratio is on the order of $0.4 \%$ which corresponds to an acquisition frequency of $7~$Hz. Sampling is differential, binary, and non-adaptive, and includes information on multiple partitioning of the image which later allows us to determine the actual field of view. Reconstruction is based on the differential Fourier domain regularized inversion (D-FDRI). The proposed SPI framework is an alternative to both adaptive SPI, which is challenging to implement in real time, and to classical compressive sensing image recovery methods, which are very slow at high resolutions.      
### 114.mmFormer: Multimodal Medical Transformer for Incomplete Multimodal Learning of Brain Tumor Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02425.pdf)
>  Accurate brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is desirable to joint learning of multimodal images. However, in clinical practice, it is not always possible to acquire a complete set of MRIs, and the problem of missing modalities causes severe performance degradation in existing multimodal segmentation methods. In this work, we present the first attempt to exploit the Transformer for multimodal brain tumor segmentation that is robust to any combinatorial subset of available modalities. Concretely, we propose a novel multimodal Medical Transformer (mmFormer) for incomplete multimodal learning with three main components: the hybrid modality-specific encoders that bridge a convolutional encoder and an intra-modal Transformer for both local and global context modeling within each modality; an inter-modal Transformer to build and align the long-range correlations across modalities for modality-invariant features with global semantics corresponding to tumor region; a decoder that performs a progressive up-sampling and fusion with the modality-invariant features to generate robust segmentation. Besides, auxiliary regularizers are introduced in both encoder and decoder to further enhance the model's robustness to incomplete modalities. We conduct extensive experiments on the public BraTS $2018$ dataset for brain tumor segmentation. The results demonstrate that the proposed mmFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for incomplete multimodal brain tumor segmentation on almost all subsets of incomplete modalities, especially by an average 19.07% improvement of Dice on tumor segmentation with only one available modality.

### 115.Is More Data All You Need? A Causal Exploration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02409.pdf)
>  Curating a large scale medical imaging dataset for machine learning applications is both time consuming and expensive. Balancing the workload between model development, data collection and annotations is difficult for machine learning practitioners, especially under time constraints. Causal analysis is often used in medicine and economics to gain insights about the effects of actions and policies. In this paper we explore the effect of dataset interventions on the output of image classification models. Through a causal approach we investigate the effects of the quantity and type of data we need to incorporate in a dataset to achieve better performance for specific subtasks. The main goal of this paper is to highlight the potential of causal analysis as a tool for resource optimization for developing medical imaging ML applications. We explore this concept with a synthetic dataset and an exemplary use-case for Diabetic Retinopathy image analysis.      
### 116.Implementation of a Modified U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation on Edge Devices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02358.pdf)
>  Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks, have shown great potential in computer vision and medical imaging applications. However, deep learning models are computationally demanding as they require enormous computational power and specialized processing hardware for model training. To make these models portable and compatible for prototyping, their implementation on low-power devices is imperative. In this work, we present the implementation of Modified U-Net on Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS-2) for the segmentation of medical images. We selected U-Net because, in medical image segmentation, U-Net is a prominent model that provides improved performance for medical image segmentation even if the dataset size is small. The modified U-Net model is evaluated for performance in terms of dice score. Experiments are reported for segmentation task on three medical imaging datasets: BraTs dataset of brain MRI, heart MRI dataset, and Ziehl-Neelsen sputum smear microscopy image (ZNSDB) dataset. For the proposed model, we reduced the number of parameters from 30 million in the U-Net model to 0.49 million in the proposed architecture. Experimental results show that the modified U-Net provides comparable performance while requiring significantly lower resources and provides inference on the NCS-2. The maximum dice scores recorded are 0.96 for the BraTs dataset, 0.94 for the heart MRI dataset, and 0.74 for the ZNSDB dataset.      
### 117.Beyond Just Vision: A Review on Self-Supervised Representation Learning on Multimodal and Temporal Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02353.pdf)
>  Recently, Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL) has attracted much attention in the field of computer vision, speech, natural language processing (NLP), and recently, with other types of modalities, including time series from sensors. The popularity of self-supervised learning is driven by the fact that traditional models typically require a huge amount of well-annotated data for training. Acquiring annotated data can be a difficult and costly process. Self-supervised methods have been introduced to improve the efficiency of training data through discriminative pre-training of models using supervisory signals that have been freely obtained from the raw data. Unlike existing reviews of SSRL that have pre-dominately focused upon methods in the fields of CV or NLP for a single modality, we aim to provide the first comprehensive review of multimodal self-supervised learning methods for temporal data. To this end, we 1) provide a comprehensive categorization of existing SSRL methods, 2) introduce a generic pipeline by defining the key components of a SSRL framework, 3) compare existing models in terms of their objective function, network architecture and potential applications, and 4) review existing multimodal techniques in each category and various modalities. Finally, we present existing weaknesses and future opportunities. We believe our work develops a perspective on the requirements of SSRL in domains that utilise multimodal and/or temporal data      
### 118.AugLoss: A Learning Methodology for Real-World Dataset Corruption  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02286.pdf)
>  Deep Learning (DL) models achieve great successes in many domains. However, DL models increasingly face safety and robustness concerns, including noisy labeling in the training stage and feature distribution shifts in the testing stage. Previous works made significant progress in addressing these problems, but the focus has largely been on developing solutions for only one problem at a time. For example, recent work has argued for the use of tunable robust loss functions to mitigate label noise, and data augmentation (e.g., AugMix) to combat distribution shifts. As a step towards addressing both problems simultaneously, we introduce AugLoss, a simple but effective methodology that achieves robustness against both train-time noisy labeling and test-time feature distribution shifts by unifying data augmentation and robust loss functions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in varied settings of real-world dataset corruption to showcase the gains achieved by AugLoss compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we hope this work will open new directions for designing more robust and reliable DL models under real-world corruptions.      
### 119.Tagged-MRI2Audio with Attention Guided Heterogeneous Translator  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02284.pdf)
>  Understanding the underlying relationship between tongue and oropharyngeal muscle deformation seen in tagged-MRI and intelligible speech plays an important role in advancing speech motor control theories and treatment of speech related-disorders. Because of their heterogeneous representations, however, direct mapping between the two modalities -- i.e., two-dimensional (mid-sagittal slice) plus time tagged-MRI sequence and its corresponding one-dimensional waveform -- is not straightforward. Instead, we resort to two-dimensional spectrograms as an intermediate representation, which contains both pitch and resonance, from which to develop an end-to-end deep learning framework to translate from a sequence of tagged-MRI to its corresponding audio waveform with limited dataset size. Our framework is based on a novel fully convolutional asymmetry translator with guidance of a self residual attention strategy to specifically exploit the moving muscular structures during speech. In addition, we leverage a pairwise correlation of the samples with the same utterances with a latent space representation disentanglement strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate an adversarial training approach with generative adversarial networks to offer improved realism on our generated spectrograms. Our experimental results, carried out with a total of 63 tagged-MRI sequences alongside speech acoustics, showed that our framework enabled the generation of clear audio waveforms from a sequence of tagged-MRI, surpassing competing methods.      
### 120.Autoregressive Model for Multi-Pass SAR Change Detection Based on Image Stacks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02278.pdf)
>  Change detection is an important synthetic aperture radar (SAR) application, usually used to detect changes on the ground scene measurements in different moments in time. Traditionally, change detection algorithm (CDA) is mainly designed for two synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images retrieved at different instants. However, more images can be used to improve the algorithms performance, witch emerges as a research topic on SAR change detection. Image stack information can be treated as a data series over time and can be modeled by autoregressive (AR) models. Thus, we present some initial findings on SAR change detection based on image stack considering AR models. Applying AR model for each pixel position in the image stack, we obtained an estimated image of the ground scene which can be used as a reference image for CDA. The experimental results reveal that ground scene estimates by the AR models is accurate and can be used for change detection applications.      
### 121.Physically Inspired Constraint for Unsupervised Regularized Ultrasound Elastography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02225.pdf)
>  Displacement estimation is a critical step of virtually all Ultrasound Elastography (USE) techniques. Two main features make this task unique compared to the general optical flow problem: the high-frequency nature of ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) data and the governing laws of physics on the displacement field. Recently, the architecture of the optical flow networks has been modified to be able to use RF data. Also, semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques have been employed for USE by considering prior knowledge of displacement continuity in the form of the first- and second-derivative regularizers. Despite these attempts, no work has considered the tissue compression pattern, and displacements in axial and lateral directions have been assumed to be independent. However, tissue motion pattern is governed by laws of physics in USE, rendering the axial and the lateral displacements highly correlated. In this paper, we propose Physically Inspired ConsTraint for Unsupervised Regularized Elastography (PICTURE), where we impose constraints on the Poisson's ratio to improve lateral displacement estimates. Experiments on phantom and in vivo data show that PICTURE substantially improves the quality of the lateral displacement estimation.      
### 122.Functional Ensemble Distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02183.pdf)
>  Bayesian models have many desirable properties, most notable is their ability to generalize from limited data and to properly estimate the uncertainty in their predictions. However, these benefits come at a steep computational cost as Bayesian inference, in most cases, is computationally intractable. One popular approach to alleviate this problem is using a Monte-Carlo estimation with an ensemble of models sampled from the posterior. However, this approach still comes at a significant computational cost, as one needs to store and run multiple models at test time. In this work, we investigate how to best distill an ensemble's predictions using an efficient model. First, we argue that current approaches that simply return distribution over predictions cannot compute important properties, such as the covariance between predictions, which can be valuable for further processing. Second, in many limited data settings, all ensemble members achieve nearly zero training loss, namely, they produce near-identical predictions on the training set which results in sub-optimal distilled models. To address both problems, we propose a novel and general distillation approach, named Functional Ensemble Distillation (FED), and we investigate how to best distill an ensemble in this setting. We find that learning the distilled model via a simple augmentation scheme in the form of mixup augmentation significantly boosts the performance. We evaluated our method on several tasks and showed that it achieves superior results in both accuracy and uncertainty estimation compared to current approaches.      
### 123.Federated Adversarial Training with Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02131.pdf)
>  Federated learning (FL) has emerged to enable global model training over distributed clients' data while preserving its privacy. However, the global trained model is vulnerable to the evasion attacks especially, the adversarial examples (AEs), carefully crafted samples to yield false classification. Adversarial training (AT) is found to be the most promising approach against evasion attacks and it is widely studied for convolutional neural network (CNN). Recently, vision transformers have been found to be effective in many computer vision tasks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no work that studied the feasibility of AT in a FL process for vision transformers. This paper investigates such feasibility with different federated model aggregation methods and different vision transformer models with different tokenization and classification head techniques. In order to improve the robust accuracy of the models with the not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID), we propose an extension to FedAvg aggregation method, called FedWAvg. By measuring the similarities between the last layer of the global model and the last layer of the client updates, FedWAvg calculates the weights to aggregate the local models updates. The experiments show that FedWAvg improves the robust accuracy when compared with other state-of-the-art aggregation methods.      
### 124.AUTM Flow: Atomic Unrestricted Time Machine for Monotonic Normalizing Flows  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02102.pdf)
>  Nonlinear monotone transformations are used extensively in normalizing flows to construct invertible triangular mappings from simple distributions to complex ones. In existing literature, monotonicity is usually enforced by restricting function classes or model parameters and the inverse transformation is often approximated by root-finding algorithms as a closed-form inverse is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce a new integral-based approach termed "Atomic Unrestricted Time Machine (AUTM)", equipped with unrestricted integrands and easy-to-compute explicit inverse. AUTM offers a versatile and efficient way to the design of normalizing flows with explicit inverse and unrestricted function classes or parameters. Theoretically, we present a constructive proof that AUTM is universal: all monotonic normalizing flows can be viewed as limits of AUTM flows. We provide a concrete example to show how to approximate any given monotonic normalizing flow using AUTM flows with guaranteed convergence. The result implies that AUTM can be used to transform an existing flow into a new one equipped with explicit inverse and unrestricted parameters. The performance of the new approach is evaluated on high dimensional density estimation, variational inference and image generation. Experiments demonstrate superior speed and memory efficiency of AUTM.      
### 125.Deep Radiomic Analysis for Predicting Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Computerized Tomography and X-ray Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01903.pdf)
>  This paper proposes to encode the distribution of features learned from a convolutional neural network using a Gaussian Mixture Model. These parametric features, called GMM-CNN, are derived from chest computed tomography and X-ray scans of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. We use the proposed GMM-CNN features as input to a robust classifier based on random forests to differentiate between COVID-19 and other pneumonia cases. Our experiments assess the advantage of GMM-CNN features compared to standard CNN classification on test images. Using a random forest classifier (80\% samples for training; 20\% samples for testing), GMM-CNN features encoded with two mixture components provided a significantly better performance than standard CNN classification (p\,$&lt;$\,0.05). Specifically, our method achieved an accuracy in the range of 96.00\,--\,96.70\% and an area under the ROC curve in the range of 99.29\,--\,99.45\%, with the best performance obtained by combining GMM-CNN features from both computed tomography and X-ray images. Our results suggest that the proposed GMM-CNN features could improve the prediction of COVID-19 in chest computed tomography and X-ray scans.      
### 126.Saliency Attack: Towards Imperceptible Black-box Adversarial Attack  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01898.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, even in the black-box setting where the attacker is only accessible to the model output. Recent studies have devised effective black-box attacks with high query efficiency. However, such performance is often accompanied by compromises in attack imperceptibility, hindering the practical use of these approaches. In this paper, we propose to restrict the perturbations to a small salient region to generate adversarial examples that can hardly be perceived. This approach is readily compatible with many existing black-box attacks and can significantly improve their imperceptibility with little degradation in attack success rate. Further, we propose the Saliency Attack, a new black-box attack aiming to refine the perturbations in the salient region to achieve even better imperceptibility. Extensive experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art black-box attacks, our approach achieves much better imperceptibility scores, including most apparent distortion (MAD), $L_0$ and $L_2$ distances, and also obtains significantly higher success rates judged by a human-like threshold on MAD. Importantly, the perturbations generated by our approach are interpretable to some extent. Finally, it is also demonstrated to be robust to different detection-based defenses.      
### 127.Modeling of Textures to Predict Immune Cell Status and Survival of Brain Tumour Patients  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01897.pdf)
>  Radiomics has shown a capability for different types of cancers such as glioma to predict the clinical outcome. It can have a non-invasive means of evaluating the immunotherapy response prior to treatment. However, the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based radiomics requires large training image sets. To avoid this problem, we investigate a new imaging features that model distribution with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of learned 3D CNN features. Using these deep radiomic features (DRFs), we aim to predict the immune marker status (low versus high) and overall survival for glioma patients. We extract the DRFs by aggregating the activation maps of a pre-trained 3D-CNN within labeled tumor regions of MRI scans that corresponded immune markers of 151 patients. Our experiments are performed to assess the relationship between the proposed DRFs, three immune cell markers (Macrophage M1, Neutrophils and T Cells Follicular Helper), and measure their association with overall survival. Using the random forest (RF) model, DRFs was able to predict the immune marker status with area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 78.67, 83.93 and 75.67\% for Macrophage M1, Neutrophils and T Cells Follicular Helper, respectively. Combined the immune markers with DRFs and clinical variables, Kaplan-Meier estimator and Log-rank test achieved the most significant difference between predicted groups of patients (short-term versus long-term survival) with p\,=\,4.31$\times$10$^{-7}$ compared to p\,=\,0.03 for Immune cell markers, p\,=\,0.07 for clinical variables , and p\,=\,1.45$\times$10$^{-5}$ for DRFs. Our findings indicate that the proposed features (DRFs) used in RF models may significantly consider prognosticating patients with brain tumour prior to surgery through regularly acquired imaging data.      
### 128.Image Data collection and implementation of deep learning-based model in detecting Monkeypox disease using modified VGG16  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01862.pdf)
>  While the world is still attempting to recover from the damage caused by the broad spread of COVID-19, the Monkeypox virus poses a new threat of becoming a global pandemic. Although the Monkeypox virus itself is not deadly and contagious as COVID-19, still every day, new patients case has been reported from many nations. Therefore, it will be no surprise if the world ever faces another global pandemic due to the lack of proper precautious steps. Recently, Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated huge potential in image-based diagnoses such as cancer detection, tumor cell identification, and COVID-19 patient detection. Therefore, a similar application can be adopted to diagnose the Monkeypox-related disease as it infected the human skin, which image can be acquired and further used in diagnosing the disease. Considering this opportunity, in this work, we introduce a newly developed "Monkeypox2022" dataset that is publicly available to use and can be obtained from our shared GitHub repository. The dataset is created by collecting images from multiple open-source and online portals that do not impose any restrictions on use, even for commercial purposes, hence giving a safer path to use and disseminate such data when constructing and deploying any type of ML model. Further, we propose and evaluate a modified VGG16 model, which includes two distinct studies: Study One and Two. Our exploratory computational results indicate that our suggested model can identify Monkeypox patients with an accuracy of $97\pm1.8\%$ (AUC=97.2) and $88\pm0.8\%$ (AUC=0.867) for Study One and Two, respectively. Additionally, we explain our model's prediction and feature extraction utilizing Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) help to a deeper insight into specific features that characterize the onset of the Monkeypox virus.      
### 129.Drawing out of Distribution with Neuro-Symbolic Generative Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01829.pdf)
>  Learning general-purpose representations from perceptual inputs is a hallmark of human intelligence. For example, people can write out numbers or characters, or even draw doodles, by characterizing these tasks as different instantiations of the same generic underlying process -- compositional arrangements of different forms of pen strokes. Crucially, learning to do one task, say writing, implies reasonable competence at another, say drawing, on account of this shared process. We present Drawing out of Distribution (DooD), a neuro-symbolic generative model of stroke-based drawing that can learn such general-purpose representations. In contrast to prior work, DooD operates directly on images, requires no supervision or expensive test-time inference, and performs unsupervised amortised inference with a symbolic stroke model that better enables both interpretability and generalization. We evaluate DooD on its ability to generalise across both data and tasks. We first perform zero-shot transfer from one dataset (e.g. MNIST) to another (e.g. Quickdraw), across five different datasets, and show that DooD clearly outperforms different baselines. An analysis of the learnt representations further highlights the benefits of adopting a symbolic stroke model. We then adopt a subset of the Omniglot challenge tasks, and evaluate its ability to generate new exemplars (both unconditionally and conditionally), and perform one-shot classification, showing that DooD matches the state of the art. Taken together, we demonstrate that DooD does indeed capture general-purpose representations across both data and task, and takes a further step towards building general and robust concept-learning systems.      
### 130.The Gamma Generalized Normal Distribution: A Descriptor of SAR Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01826.pdf)
>  We propose a new four-parameter distribution for modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery named the gamma generalized normal (GGN) by combining the gamma and generalized normal distributions. A mathematical characterization of the new distribution is provided by identifying the limit behavior and by calculating the density and moment expansions. The GGN model performance is evaluated on both synthetic and actual data and, for that, maximum likelihood estimation and random number generation are discussed. The proposed distribution is compared with the beta generalized normal distribution (BGN), which has already shown to appropriately represent SAR imagery. The performance of these two distributions are measured by means of statistics which provide evidence that the GGN can outperform the BGN distribution in some contexts.      
### 131.R2U++: A Multiscale Recurrent Residual U-Net with Dense Skip Connections for Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01793.pdf)
>  U-Net is a widely adopted neural network in the domain of medical image segmentation. Despite its quick embracement by the medical imaging community, its performance suffers on complicated datasets. The problem can be ascribed to its simple feature extracting blocks: encoder/decoder, and the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Variants of U-Net (such as R2U-Net) have been proposed to address the problem of simple feature extracting blocks by making the network deeper, but it does not deal with the semantic gap problem. On the other hand, another variant UNET++ deals with the semantic gap problem by introducing dense skip connections but has simple feature extraction blocks. To overcome these issues, we propose a new U-Net based medical image segmentation architecture R2U++. In the proposed architecture, the adapted changes from vanilla U-Net are: (1) the plain convolutional backbone is replaced by a deeper recurrent residual convolution block. The increased field of view with these blocks aids in extracting crucial features for segmentation which is proven by improvement in the overall performance of the network. (2) The semantic gap between encoder and decoder is reduced by dense skip pathways. These pathways accumulate features coming from multiple scales and apply concatenation accordingly. The modified architecture has embedded multi-depth models, and an ensemble of outputs taken from varying depths improves the performance on foreground objects appearing at various scales in the images. The performance of R2U++ is evaluated on four distinct medical imaging modalities: electron microscopy (EM), X-rays, fundus, and computed tomography (CT). The average gain achieved in IoU score is 1.5+-0.37% and in dice score is 0.9+-0.33% over UNET++, whereas, 4.21+-2.72 in IoU and 3.47+-1.89 in dice score over R2U-Net across different medical imaging segmentation datasets.

### 133.Automatic Quantification of Volumes and Biventricular Function in Cardiac Resonance. Validation of a New Artificial Intelligence Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01746.pdf)
>  Background: Artificial intelligence techniques have shown great potential in cardiology, especially in quantifying cardiac biventricular function, volume, mass, and ejection fraction (EF). However, its use in clinical practice is not straightforward due to its poor reproducibility with cases from daily practice, among other reasons. Objectives: To validate a new artificial intelligence tool in order to quantify the cardiac biventricular function (volume, mass, and EF). To analyze its robustness in the clinical area, and the computational times compared with conventional methods. Methods: A total of 189 patients were analyzed: 89 from a regional center and 100 from a public center. The method proposes two convolutional networks that include anatomical information of the heart to reduce classification errors. Results: A high concordance (Pearson coefficient) was observed between manual quantification and the proposed quantification of cardiac function (0.98, 0.92, 0.96 and 0.8 for volumes and biventricular EF) in about 5 seconds per study. Conclusions: This method quantifies biventricular function and volumes in seconds with an accuracy equivalent to that of a specialist.      
### 134.Detection of Fibrosis in Cine Magnetic Resonance Images Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01745.pdf)
>  Background: Artificial intelligence techniques have demonstrated great potential in cardiology, especially to detect imperceptible patterns for the human eye. In this sense, these techniques seem to be adequate to identify patterns in the myocardial texture which could lead to characterize and quantify fibrosis. Purpose: The aim of this study was to postulate a new artificial intelligence method to identify fibrosis in cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Methods: A retrospective observational study was carried out in a population of 75 subjects from a clinical center of San Carlos de Bariloche. The proposed method analyzes the myocardial texture in cine CMR images using a convolutional neural network to determine local myocardial tissue damage. Results: An accuracy of 89% for quantifying local tissue damage was observed for the validation data set and 70% for the test set. In addition, the qualitative analysis showed a high spatial correlation in lesion location. Conclusions: The postulated method enables to spatially identify fibrosis using only the information from cine nuclear magnetic resonance studies, demonstrating the potential of this technique to quantify myocardial viability in the future or to study the lesions etiology      
### 135.Orthogonal Transform based Generative Adversarial Network for Image Dehazing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01743.pdf)
>  Image dehazing has become one of the crucial preprocessing steps for any computer vision task. Most of the dehazing methods try to estimate the transmission map along with the atmospheric light to get the dehazed image in the image domain. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end architecture that directly estimates dehazed image in Krawtchouk transform domain. For this a customized Krawtchouk Convolution Layer (KCL) in the architecture is added. KCL is constructed using Krawtchouk basis functions which converts the image from the spatial domain to the Krawtchouk transform domain. Another convolution layer is added at the end of the architecture named as Inverse Krawtchouk Convolution Layer (IKCL) which converts the image back to the spatial domain from the transform domain. It has been observed that the haze is mainly present in lower frequencies of hazy images, wherein the Krawtchouk transform helps to analyze the high and low frequencies of the images separately. We have divided our architecture into two branches, the upper branch deals with the higher frequencies while the lower branch deals with the lower frequencies of the image. The lower branch is made deeper in terms of the layers as compared to the upper branch to address the haze present in the lower frequencies. Using the proposed Orthogonal Transform based Generative Adversarial Network (OTGAN) architecture for image dehazing, we were able to achieve competitive results when compared to the present state-of-the-art methods.      
### 136.Learning Probabilistic Structural Representation for Biomedical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01742.pdf)
>  Accurate segmentation of various fine-scale structures from biomedical images is a very important yet challenging problem. Existing methods use topological information as an additional training loss, but are ultimately learning a pixel-wise representation. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning method to learn a structural representation. We use discrete Morse theory and persistent homology to construct an one-parameter family of structures as the structural representation space. Furthermore, we learn a probabilistic model that can do inference tasks on such a structural representation space. We empirically demonstrate the strength of our method, i.e., generating true structures rather than pixel-maps with better topological integrity, and facilitating a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline using the sampling of structures and structure-aware uncertainty.      
### 137.Patcher: Patch Transformers with Mixture of Experts for Precise Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01741.pdf)
>  We present a new encoder-decoder Vision Transformer architecture, Patcher, for medical image segmentation. Unlike standard Vision Transformers, it employs Patcher blocks that segment an image into large patches, each of which is further divided into small patches. Transformers are applied to the small patches within a large patch, which constrains the receptive field of each pixel. We intentionally make the large patches overlap to enhance intra-patch communication. The encoder employs a cascade of Patcher blocks with increasing receptive fields to extract features from local to global levels. This design allows Patcher to benefit from both the coarse-to-fine feature extraction common in CNNs and the superior spatial relationship modeling of Transformers. We also propose a new mixture-of-experts (MoE) based decoder, which treats the feature maps from the encoder as experts and selects a suitable set of expert features to predict the label for each pixel. The use of MoE enables better specializations of the expert features and reduces interference between them during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Patcher outperforms state-of-the-art Transformer- and CNN-based approaches significantly on stroke lesion segmentation and polyp segmentation. Code for Patcher will be released with publication to facilitate future research.      
### 138.Denoising Fast X-Ray Fluorescence Raster Scans of Paintings  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01740.pdf)
>  Macro x-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging of cultural heritage objects, while a popular non-invasive technique for providing elemental distribution maps, is a slow acquisition process in acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio XRF volumes. Typically on the order of tenths of a second per pixel, a raster scanning probe counts the number of photons at different energies emitted by the object under x-ray illumination. In an effort to reduce the scan times without sacrificing elemental map and XRF volume quality, we propose using dictionary learning with a Poisson noise model as well as a color image-based prior to restore noisy, rapidly acquired XRF data.      
### 139.Mutual- and Self- Prototype Alignment for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01739.pdf)
>  Semi-supervised learning methods have been explored in medical image segmentation tasks due to the scarcity of pixel-level annotation in the real scenario. Proto-type alignment based consistency constraint is an intuitional and plausible solu-tion to explore the useful information in the unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a mutual- and self- prototype alignment (MSPA) framework to better utilize the unlabeled data. In specific, mutual-prototype alignment enhances the information interaction between labeled and unlabeled data. The mutual-prototype alignment imposes two consistency constraints in reverse directions between the unlabeled and labeled data, which enables the consistent embedding and model discriminability on unlabeled data. The proposed self-prototype alignment learns more stable region-wise features within unlabeled images, which optimizes the classification margin in semi-supervised segmentation by boosting the intra-class compactness and inter-class separation on the feature space. Extensive experimental results on three medical datasets demonstrate that with a small amount of labeled data, MSPA achieves large improvements by leveraging the unlabeled data. Our method also outperforms seven state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods on all three datasets.      
### 140.RIDDLE: Lidar Data Compression with Range Image Deep Delta Encoding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01738.pdf)
>  Lidars are depth measuring sensors widely used in autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, the large volume of data produced by lidars can lead to high costs in data storage and transmission. While lidar data can be represented as two interchangeable representations: 3D point clouds and range images, most previous work focus on compressing the generic 3D point clouds. In this work, we show that directly compressing the range images can leverage the lidar scanning pattern, compared to compressing the unprojected point clouds. We propose a novel data-driven range image compression algorithm, named RIDDLE (Range Image Deep DeLta Encoding). At its core is a deep model that predicts the next pixel value in a raster scanning order, based on contextual laser shots from both the current and past scans (represented as a 4D point cloud of spherical coordinates and time). The deltas between predictions and original values can then be compressed by entropy encoding. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI, our method demonstrates significant improvement in the compression rate (under the same distortion) compared to widely used point cloud and range image compression algorithms as well as recent deep methods.      
### 141.MaxStyle: Adversarial Style Composition for Robust Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01737.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable segmentation accuracy on benchmark datasets where training and test sets are from the same domain, yet their performance can degrade significantly on unseen domains, which hinders the deployment of CNNs in many clinical scenarios. Most existing works improve model out-of-domain (OOD) robustness by collecting multi-domain datasets for training, which is expensive and may not always be feasible due to privacy and logistical issues. In this work, we focus on improving model robustness using a single-domain dataset only. We propose a novel data augmentation framework called MaxStyle, which maximizes the effectiveness of style augmentation for model OOD performance. It attaches an auxiliary style-augmented image decoder to a segmentation network for robust feature learning and data augmentation. Importantly, MaxStyle augments data with improved image style diversity and hardness, by expanding the style space with noise and searching for the worst-case style composition of latent features via adversarial training. With extensive experiments on multiple public cardiac and prostate MR datasets, we demonstrate that MaxStyle leads to significantly improved out-of-distribution robustness against unseen corruptions as well as common distribution shifts across multiple, different, unseen sites and unknown image sequences under both low- and high-training data settings.

### 142.Adaptive Adversarial Training to Improve Adversarial Robustness of DNNs for Medical Image Segmentation and Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01736.pdf)
>  Recent methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have reached high accuracy for medical image analysis, including the three basic tasks: segmentation, landmark detection, and object detection. It is known that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and the adversarial robustness of DNNs could be improved by adding adversarial noises to training data (i.e., adversarial training). In this study, we show that the standard adversarial training (SAT) method has a severe issue that limits its practical use: it generates a fixed level of noise for DNN training, and it is difficult for the user to choose an appropriate noise level, because a high noise level may lead to a large reduction in model performance, and a low noise level may have little effect. To resolve this issue, we have designed a novel adaptive-margin adversarial training (AMAT) method that generates adaptive adversarial noises for DNN training, which are dynamically tailored for each individual training sample. We have applied our AMAT method to state-of-the-art DNNs for the three basic tasks, using five publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our AMAT method outperforms the SAT method in adversarial robustness on noisy data and prediction accuracy on clean data.

### 143.Examining the behaviour of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for brain tumor detection with and without transfer learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01735.pdf)
>  Distinguishing normal from malignant and determining the tumor type are critical components of brain tumor diagnosis. Two different kinds of dataset are investigated using state-of-the-art CNN models in this research work. One dataset(binary) has images of normal and tumor types, while another(multi-class) provides all images of tumors classified as glioma, meningioma, or pituitary. The experiments were conducted in these dataset with transfer learning from pre-trained weights from ImageNet as well as initializing the weights randomly. The experimental environment is equivalent for all models in this study in order to make a fair comparison. For both of the dataset, the validation set are same for all the models where train data is 60% while the rest is 40% for validation. With the proposed techniques in this research, the EfficientNet-B5 architecture outperforms all the state-of-the-art models in the binary-classification dataset with the accuracy of 99.75% and 98.61% accuracy for the multi-class dataset. This research also demonstrates the behaviour of convergence of validation loss in different weight initialization techniques.      
### 144.Empirical Study of Quality Image Assessment for Synthesis of Fetal Head Ultrasound Imaging with DCGANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01731.pdf)
>  In this work, we present an empirical study of DCGANs for synthetic generation of fetal head ultrasound, consisting of hyperparameter heuristics and image quality assessment. We present experiments to show the impact of different image sizes, epochs, data size input, and learning rates for quality image assessment on four metrics: mutual information (MI), fréchet inception distance (FID), peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and local binary pattern vector (LBPv). The results show that FID and LBPv have stronger relationship with clinical image quality scores.

### 145.A review of machine learning approaches, challenges and prospects for computational tumor pathology  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01728.pdf)
>  Computational pathology is part of precision oncology medicine. The integration of high-throughput data including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, pathomics, and radiomics into clinical practice improves cancer treatment plans, treatment cycles, and cure rates, and helps doctors open up innovative approaches to patient prognosis. In the past decade, rapid advances in artificial intelligence, chip design and manufacturing, and mobile computing have facilitated research in computational pathology and have the potential to provide better-integrated solutions for whole-slide images, multi-omics data, and clinical informatics. However, tumor computational pathology now brings some challenges to the application of tumour screening, diagnosis and prognosis in terms of data integration, hardware processing, network sharing bandwidth and machine learning technology. This review investigates image preprocessing methods in computational pathology from a pathological and technical perspective, machine learning-based methods, and applications of computational pathology in breast, colon, prostate, lung, and various tumour disease scenarios. Finally, the challenges and prospects of machine learning in computational pathology applications are discussed.      
### 146.Polyp-PVT: Polyp Segmentation with Pyramid Vision Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06932.pdf)
>  Most polyp segmentation methods use CNNs as their backbone, leading to two key issues when exchanging information between the encoder and decoder: 1) taking into account the differences in contribution between different-level features; and 2) designing an effective mechanism for fusing these features. Different from existing CNN-based methods, we adopt a transformer encoder, which learns more powerful and robust representations. In addition, considering the image acquisition influence and elusive properties of polyps, we introduce three novel modules, including a cascaded fusion module (CFM), a camouflage identification module (CIM), a and similarity aggregation module (SAM). Among these, the CFM is used to collect the semantic and location information of polyps from high-level features, while the CIM is applied to capture polyp information disguised in low-level features. With the help of the SAM, we extend the pixel features of the polyp area with high-level semantic position information to the entire polyp area, thereby effectively fusing cross-level features. The proposed model, named Polyp-PVT, effectively suppresses noises in the features and significantly improves their expressive capabilities. Extensive experiments on five widely adopted datasets show that the proposed model is more robust to various challenging situations (e.g., appearance changes, small objects) than existing methods, and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance. The proposed model is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/DengPingFan/Polyp-PVT" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.
