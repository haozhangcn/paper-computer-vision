### 1.Third Time's the Charm? Image and Video Editing with StyleGAN3  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13433.pdf)
>  StyleGAN is arguably one of the most intriguing and well-studied generative models, demonstrating impressive performance in image generation, inversion, and manipulation. In this work, we explore the recent StyleGAN3 architecture, compare it to its predecessor, and investigate its unique advantages, as well as drawbacks. In particular, we demonstrate that while StyleGAN3 can be trained on unaligned data, one can still use aligned data for training, without hindering the ability to generate unaligned imagery. Next, our analysis of the disentanglement of the different latent spaces of StyleGAN3 indicates that the commonly used W/W+ spaces are more entangled than their StyleGAN2 counterparts, underscoring the benefits of using the StyleSpace for fine-grained editing. Considering image inversion, we observe that existing encoder-based techniques struggle when trained on unaligned data. We therefore propose an encoding scheme trained solely on aligned data, yet can still invert unaligned images. Finally, we introduce a novel video inversion and editing workflow that leverages the capabilities of a fine-tuned StyleGAN3 generator to reduce texture sticking and expand the field of view of the edited video.      
### 2.MHSnet: Multi-head and Spatial Attention Network with False-Positive Reduction for Pulmonary Nodules Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13392.pdf)
>  The mortality of lung cancer has ranked high among cancers for many years. Early detection of lung cancer is critical for disease prevention, cure, and mortality rate reduction. However, existing detection methods on pulmonary nodules introduce an excessive number of false positive proposals in order to achieve high sensitivity, which is not practical in clinical situations. In this paper, we propose the multi-head detection and spatial squeeze-and-attention network, MHSnet, to detect pulmonary nodules, in order to aid doctors in the early diagnosis of lung cancers. Specifically, we first introduce multi-head detectors and skip connections to customize for the variety of nodules in sizes, shapes and types and capture multi-scale features. Then, we implement a spatial attention module to enable the network to focus on different regions differently inspired by how experienced clinicians screen CT images, which results in fewer false positive proposals. Lastly, we present a lightweight but effective false positive reduction module with the Linear Regression model to cut down the number of false positive proposals, without any constraints on the front network. Extensive experimental results compared with the state-of-the-art models have shown the superiority of the MHSnet in terms of the average FROC, sensitivity and especially false discovery rate (2.98% and 2.18% improvement in terms of average FROC and sensitivity, 5.62% and 28.33% decrease in terms of false discovery rate and average candidates per scan). The false positive reduction module significantly decreases the average number of candidates generated per scan by 68.11% and the false discovery rate by 13.48%, which is promising to reduce distracted proposals for the downstream tasks based on the detection results.      
### 3.Modeling the Background for Incremental and Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13338.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have enabled major progresses in semantic segmentation. However, even the most advanced neural architectures suffer from important limitations. First, they are vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting, i.e. they perform poorly when they are required to incrementally update their model as new classes are available. Second, they rely on large amount of pixel-level annotations to produce accurate segmentation maps. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel incremental class learning approach for semantic segmentation taking into account a peculiar aspect of this task: since each training step provides annotation only for a subset of all possible classes, pixels of the background class exhibit a semantic shift. Therefore, we revisit the traditional distillation paradigm by designing novel loss terms which explicitly account for the background shift. Additionally, we introduce a novel strategy to initialize classifier's parameters at each step in order to prevent biased predictions toward the background class. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to point- and scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation, modeling the partial annotations to create priors for unlabeled pixels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive evaluation on the Pascal-VOC, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.      
### 4.Learning to Hash Naturally Sorts  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13322.pdf)
>  Locality sensitive hashing pictures a list-wise sorting problem. Its testing metrics, e.g., mean-average precision, count on a sorted candidate list ordered by pair-wise code similarity. However, scarcely does one train a deep hashing model with the sorted results end-to-end because of the non-differentiable nature of the sorting operation. This inconsistency in the objectives of training and test may lead to sub-optimal performance since the training loss often fails to reflect the actual retrieval metric. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing Naturally-Sorted Hashing (NSH). We sort the Hamming distances of samples' hash codes and accordingly gather their latent representations for self-supervised training. Thanks to the recent advances in differentiable sorting approximations, the hash head receives gradients from the sorter so that the hash encoder can be optimized along with the training procedure. Additionally, we describe a novel Sorted Noise-Contrastive Estimation (SortedNCE) loss that selectively picks positive and negative samples for contrastive learning, which allows NSH to mine data semantic relations during training in an unsupervised manner. Our extensive experiments show the proposed NSH model significantly outperforms the existing unsupervised hashing methods on three benchmarked datasets.      
### 5.On scale-invariant properties in natural images and their simulations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13312.pdf)
>  We study samples of natural images for which a set of statistical characteristics is computed and scale-invariant properties of samples are demonstrated computationally. Computations of the power spectrum are carried out and a power-law decaying power spectrum is observed on samples taken from van Hateren images of natural scenes. We propose a dynamic model to reproduce the observed slope in the power spectrum qualitatively. For two types of sources for this model the behaviour of power spectrum is investigated and scale-invariance confirmed numerically. We then discuss potential applications of scale-invariant properties of natural images.      
### 6.Metrics for saliency map evaluation of deep learning explanation methods  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13291.pdf)
>  Due to the black-box nature of deep learning models, there is a recent development of solutions for visual explanations of CNNs. Given the high cost of user studies, metrics are necessary to compare and evaluate these different methods. In this paper, we critically analyze the Deletion Area Under Curve (DAUC) and Insertion Area Under Curve (IAUC) metrics proposed by Petsiuk et al. (2018). These metrics were designed to evaluate the faithfulness of saliency maps generated by generic methods such as Grad-CAM or RISE. First, we show that the actual saliency score values given by the saliency map are ignored as only the ranking of the scores is taken into account. This shows that these metrics are insufficient by themselves, as the visual appearance of a saliency map can change significantly without the ranking of the scores being modified. Secondly, we argue that during the computation of DAUC and IAUC, the model is presented with images that are out of the training distribution which might lead to an unreliable behavior of the model being explained. %First, we show that one can drastically change the visual appearance of an explanation map without changing the pixel ranking, i.e. without changing the DAUC and IAUC values. %We argue that DAUC and IAUC only takes into account the scores ranking and ignore the score values. To complement DAUC/IAUC, we propose new metrics that quantify the sparsity and the calibration of explanation methods, two previously unstudied properties. Finally, we give general remarks about the metrics studied in this paper and discuss how to evaluate them in a user study.      
### 7.UQGAN: A Unified Model for Uncertainty Quantification of Deep Classifiers trained via Conditional GANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13279.pdf)
>  We present an approach to quantifying both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty for deep neural networks in image classification, based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). While most works in the literature that use GANs to generate out-of-distribution (OoD) examples only focus on the evaluation of OoD detection, we present a GAN based approach to learn a classifier that exhibits proper uncertainties for OoD examples as well as for false positives (FPs). Instead of shielding the entire in-distribution data with GAN generated OoD examples which is state-of-the-art, we shield each class separately with out-of-class examples generated by a conditional GAN and complement this with a one-vs-all image classifier. In our experiments, in particular on CIFAR10, we improve over the OoD detection and FP detection performance of state-of-the-art GAN-training based classifiers. Furthermore, we also find that the generated GAN examples do not significantly affect the calibration error of our classifier and result in a significant gain in model accuracy.      
### 8.Combining Local and Global Pose Estimation for Precise Tracking of Similar Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13278.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a multi-object 6D detection and tracking pipeline for potentially similar and non-textured objects. The combination of a convolutional neural network for object classification and rough pose estimation with a local pose refinement and an automatic mismatch detection enables direct application in real-time AR scenarios. A new network architecture, trained solely with synthetic images, allows simultaneous pose estimation of multiple objects with reduced GPU memory consumption and enhanced performance. In addition, the pose estimates are further improved by a local edge-based refinement step that explicitly exploits known object geometry information. For continuous movements, the sole use of local refinement reduces pose mismatches due to geometric ambiguities or occlusions. We showcase the entire tracking pipeline and demonstrate the benefits of the combined approach. Experiments on a challenging set of non-textured similar objects demonstrate the enhanced quality compared to the baseline method. Finally, we illustrate how the system can be used in a real AR assistance application within the field of construction.      
### 9.StRegA: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRIs using a Compact Context-encoding Variational Autoencoder  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13271.pdf)
>  Expert interpretation of anatomical images of the human brain is the central part of neuro-radiology. Several machine learning-based techniques have been proposed to assist in the analysis process. However, the ML models typically need to be trained to perform a specific task, e.g., brain tumour segmentation or classification. Not only do the corresponding training data require laborious manual annotations, but a wide variety of abnormalities can be present in a human brain MRI - even more than one simultaneously, which renders representation of all possible anomalies very challenging. Hence, a possible solution is an unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) system that can learn a data distribution from an unlabelled dataset of healthy subjects and then be applied to detect out of distribution samples. Such a technique can then be used to detect anomalies - lesions or abnormalities, for example, brain tumours, without explicitly training the model for that specific pathology. Several Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based techniques have been proposed in the past for this task. Even though they perform very well on controlled artificially simulated anomalies, many of them perform poorly while detecting anomalies in clinical data. This research proposes a compact version of the "context-encoding" VAE (ceVAE) model, combined with pre and post-processing steps, creating a UAD pipeline (StRegA), which is more robust on clinical data, and shows its applicability in detecting anomalies such as tumours in brain MRIs. The proposed pipeline achieved a Dice score of 0.642$\pm$0.101 while detecting tumours in T2w images of the BraTS dataset and 0.859$\pm$0.112 while detecting artificially induced anomalies, while the best performing baseline achieved 0.522$\pm$0.135 and 0.783$\pm$0.111, respectively.      
### 10.Network-level Safety Metrics for Overall Traffic Safety Assessment: A Case Study  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13229.pdf)
>  Driving safety analysis has recently witnessed unprecedented results due to advances in computation frameworks, connected vehicle technology, new generation sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly, the recent advances performance of deep learning (DL) methods realized higher levels of safety for autonomous vehicles and empowered volume imagery processing for driving safety analysis. An important application of DL methods is extracting driving safety metrics from traffic imagery. However, the majority of current methods use safety metrics for micro-scale analysis of individual crash incidents or near-crash events, which does not provide insightful guidelines for the overall network-level traffic management. On the other hand, large-scale safety assessment efforts mainly emphasize spatial and temporal distributions of crashes, while not always revealing the safety violations that cause crashes. To bridge these two perspectives, we define a new set of network-level safety metrics for the overall safety assessment of traffic flow by processing imagery taken by roadside infrastructure sensors. An integrative analysis of the safety metrics and crash data reveals the insightful temporal and spatial correlation between the representative network-level safety metrics and the crash frequency. The analysis is performed using two video cameras in the state of Arizona along with a 5-year crash report obtained from the Arizona Department of Transportation. The results confirm that network-level safety metrics can be used by the traffic management teams to equip traffic monitoring systems with advanced AI-based risk analysis, and timely traffic flow control decisions.      
### 11.Learning Super-Features for Image Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13182.pdf)
>  Methods that combine local and global features have recently shown excellent performance on multiple challenging deep image retrieval benchmarks, but their use of local features raises at least two issues. First, these local features simply boil down to the localized map activations of a neural network, and hence can be extremely redundant. Second, they are typically trained with a global loss that only acts on top of an aggregation of local features; by contrast, testing is based on local feature matching, which creates a discrepancy between training and testing. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for deep image retrieval, based solely on mid-level features that we call Super-features. These Super-features are constructed by an iterative attention module and constitute an ordered set in which each element focuses on a localized and discriminant image pattern. For training, they require only image labels. A contrastive loss operates directly at the level of Super-features and focuses on those that match across images. A second complementary loss encourages diversity. Experiments on common landmark retrieval benchmarks validate that Super-features substantially outperform state-of-the-art methods when using the same number of features, and only require a significantly smaller memory footprint to match their performance.

### 12.Few-Shot Backdoor Attacks on Visual Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13178.pdf)
>  Visual object tracking (VOT) has been widely adopted in mission-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance systems. In current practice, third-party resources such as datasets, backbone networks, and training platforms are frequently used to train high-performance VOT models. Whilst these resources bring certain convenience, they also introduce new security threats into VOT models. In this paper, we reveal such a threat where an adversary can easily implant hidden backdoors into VOT models by tempering with the training process. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective few-shot backdoor attack (FSBA) that optimizes two losses alternately: 1) a \emph{feature loss} defined in the hidden feature space, and 2) the standard \emph{tracking loss}. We show that, once the backdoor is embedded into the target model by our FSBA, it can trick the model to lose track of specific objects even when the \emph{trigger} only appears in one or a few frames. We examine our attack in both digital and physical-world settings and show that it can significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art VOT trackers. We also show that our attack is resistant to potential defenses, highlighting the vulnerability of VOT models to potential backdoor attacks.      
### 13.Imperceptible and Multi-channel Backdoor Attack against Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13164.pdf)
>  Recent researches demonstrate that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The backdoored DNN model will behave maliciously when images containing backdoor triggers arrive. To date, existing backdoor attacks are single-trigger and single-target attacks, and the triggers of most existing backdoor attacks are obvious thus are easy to be detected or noticed. In this paper, we propose a novel imperceptible and multi-channel backdoor attack against Deep Neural Networks by exploiting Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) steganography. Based on the proposed backdoor attack method, we implement two variants of backdoor attacks, i.e., N-to-N backdoor attack and N-to-One backdoor attack. Specifically, for a colored image, we utilize DCT steganography to construct the trigger on different channels of the image. As a result, the trigger is stealthy and natural. Based on the proposed method, we implement multi-target and multi-trigger backdoor attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the average attack success rate of the N-to-N backdoor attack is 93.95% on CIFAR-10 dataset and 91.55% on TinyImageNet dataset, respectively. The average attack success rate of N-to-One attack is 90.22% and 89.53% on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed backdoor attack does not affect the classification accuracy of the DNN model. Moreover, the proposed attack is demonstrated to be robust to the state-of-the-art backdoor defense (Neural Cleanse).      
### 14.Adversarial Masking for Self-Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13100.pdf)
>  We propose ADIOS, a masked image model (MIM) framework for self-supervised learning, which simultaneously learns a masking function and an image encoder using an adversarial objective. The image encoder is trained to minimise the distance between representations of the original and that of a masked image. The masking function, conversely, aims at maximising this distance. ADIOS consistently improves on state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) methods on a variety of tasks and datasets -- including classification on ImageNet100 and STL10, transfer learning on CIFAR10/100, Flowers102 and iNaturalist, as well as robustness evaluated on the backgrounds challenge (Xiao et al., 2021) -- while generating semantically meaningful masks. Unlike modern MIM models such as MAE, BEiT and iBOT, ADIOS does not rely on the image-patch tokenisation construction of Vision Transformers, and can be implemented with convolutional backbones. We further demonstrate that the masks learned by ADIOS are more effective in improving representation learning of SSL methods than masking schemes used in popular MIM models.      
### 15.Crowd-powered Face Manipulation Detection: Fusing Human Examiner Decisions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13084.pdf)
>  We investigate the potential of fusing human examiner decisions for the task of digital face manipulation detection. To this end, various decision fusion methods are proposed incorporating the examiners' decision confidence, experience level, and their time to take a decision. Conducted experiments are based on a psychophysical evaluation of digital face image manipulation detection capabilities of humans in which different manipulation techniques were applied, i.e. face morphing, face swapping and retouching. The decisions of 223 participants were fused to simulate crowds of up to seven human examiners. Experimental results reveal that (1) despite the moderate detection performance achieved by single human examiners, a high accuracy can be obtained through decision fusion and (2) a weighted fusion which takes the examiners' decision confidence into account yields the most competitive detection performance.      
### 16.Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in 3D Brain MRI using Deep Learning with Multi-Task Brain Age Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13081.pdf)
>  Lesion detection in brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) remains a challenging task. MRIs are typically read and interpreted by domain experts, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. Recently, unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in brain MRI with deep learning has shown promising results to provide a quick, initial assessment. So far, these methods only rely on the visual appearance of healthy brain anatomy for anomaly detection. Another biomarker for abnormal brain development is the deviation between the brain age and the chronological age, which is unexplored in combination with UAD. We propose deep learning for UAD in 3D brain MRI considering additional age information. We analyze the value of age information during training, as an additional anomaly score, and systematically study several architecture concepts. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel deep learning approach for UAD with multi-task age prediction. We use clinical T1-weighted MRIs of 1735 healthy subjects and the publicly available BraTs 2019 data set for our study. Our novel approach significantly improves UAD performance with an AUC of 92.60% compared to an AUC-score of 84.37% using previous approaches without age information.      
### 17.Lymphoma segmentation from 3D PET-CT images using a deep evidential network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13078.pdf)
>  An automatic evidential segmentation method based on Dempster-Shafer theory and deep learning is proposed to segment lymphomas from three-dimensional Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) images. The architecture is composed of a deep feature-extraction module and an evidential layer. The feature extraction module uses an encoder-decoder framework to extract semantic feature vectors from 3D inputs. The evidential layer then uses prototypes in the feature space to compute a belief function at each voxel quantifying the uncertainty about the presence or absence of a lymphoma at this location. Two evidential layers are compared, based on different ways of using distances to prototypes for computing mass functions. The whole model is trained end-to-end by minimizing the Dice loss function. The proposed combination of deep feature extraction and evidential segmentation is shown to outperform the baseline UNet model as well as three other state-of-the-art models on a dataset of 173 patients.      
### 18.Single Object Tracking: A Survey of Methods, Datasets, and Evaluation Metrics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13066.pdf)
>  Object tracking is one of the foremost assignments in computer vision that has numerous commonsense applications such as traffic monitoring, robotics, autonomous vehicle tracking, and so on. Different researches have been tried later a long time, but since of diverse challenges such as occlusion, illumination variations, fast motion, etc. researches in this area continues. In this paper, different strategies of the following objects are inspected and a comprehensive classification is displayed that classified the following strategies into four fundamental categories of feature-based, segmentation-based, estimation-based, and learning-based methods that each of which has its claim sub-categories. The most center of this paper is on learning-based strategies, which are classified into three categories of generative strategies, discriminative strategies, and reinforcement learning. One of the sub-categories of the discriminative show is deep learning. Since of high-performance, deep learning has as of late been exceptionally much consider. Finally, the different datasets and the evaluation methods that are most commonly used will be introduced.      
### 19.Rigidity Preserving Image Transformations and Equivariance in Perspective  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13065.pdf)
>  We characterize the class of image plane transformations which realize rigid camera motions and call these transformations `rigidity preserving'. In particular, 2D translations of pinhole images are not rigidity preserving. Hence, when using CNNs for 3D inference tasks, it can be beneficial to modify the inductive bias from equivariance towards translations to equivariance towards rigidity preserving transformations. We investigate how equivariance with respect to rigidity preserving transformations can be approximated in CNNs, and test our ideas on both 6D object pose estimation and visual localization. Experimentally, we improve on several competitive baselines.      
### 20.NeuralTailor: Reconstructing Sewing Pattern Structures from 3D Point Clouds of Garments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13063.pdf)
>  The fields of SocialVR, performance capture, and virtual try-on are often faced with a need to faithfully reproduce real garments in the virtual world. One critical task is the disentanglement of the intrinsic garment shape from deformations due to fabric properties, physical forces, and contact with the body. We propose to use a garment sewing pattern, a realistic and compact garment descriptor, to facilitate the intrinsic garment shape estimation. Another major challenge is a high diversity of shapes and designs in the domain. The most common approach for Deep Learning on 3D garments is to build specialized models for individual garments or garment types. We argue that building a unified model for various garment designs has the benefit of generalization to novel garment types, hence covering a larger design domain than individual models would. We introduce NeuralTailor, a novel architecture based on point-level attention for set regression with variable cardinality, and apply it to the task of reconstructing 2D garment sewing patterns from the 3D point could garment models. Our experiments show that NeuralTailor successfully reconstructs sewing patterns and generalizes to garment types with pattern topologies unseen during training.      
### 21.BOAT: Bilateral Local Attention Vision Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13027.pdf)
>  Vision Transformers achieved outstanding performance in many computer vision tasks. Early Vision Transformers such as ViT and DeiT adopt global self-attention, which is computationally expensive when the number of patches is large. To improve efficiency, recent Vision Transformers adopt local self-attention mechanisms, where self-attention is computed within local windows. Despite the fact that window-based local self-attention significantly boosts efficiency, it fails to capture the relationships between distant but similar patches in the image plane. To overcome this limitation of image-space local attention, in this paper, we further exploit the locality of patches in the feature space. We group the patches into multiple clusters using their features, and self-attention is computed within every cluster. Such feature-space local attention effectively captures the connections between patches across different local windows but still relevant. We propose a Bilateral lOcal Attention vision Transformer (BOAT), which integrates feature-space local attention with image-space local attention. We further integrate BOAT with both Swin and CSWin models, and extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our BOAT-CSWin model clearly and consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art CNN models and vision Transformers.      
### 22.Filtering In Implicit Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13013.pdf)
>  Implicit neural networks (INNs) are very effective for learning data representation. However, most INNs inevitably generate over-smoothed patches or obvious noisy artifacts in the results when the data has many scales of details or a wide range of frequencies, leading to significant performance reduction. Adapting the result containing both noise and over-smoothed regions usually suffers from either over smoothing or noisy issues. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new framework, coined FINN, that integrated a \emph{filtering} module to the \emph{implicit neural network} to perform data fitting while filtering artifacts. The filtering module has a smoothing operator that acts on the intermediate results of the network and a recovering operator that brings distinct details from the input back to the regions overly smoothed. The proposed method significantly alleviates over smoothing or noisy issues. We demonstrate the advantage of the FINN on the image regression task, considering both real and synthetic images, and showcases significant improvement on both quantitative and qualitative results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, FINN yields better performance in both convergence speed and network stability.

### 23.Plug-In Inversion: Model-Agnostic Inversion for Vision with Data Augmentations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12961.pdf)
>  Existing techniques for model inversion typically rely on hard-to-tune regularizers, such as total variation or feature regularization, which must be individually calibrated for each network in order to produce adequate images. In this work, we introduce Plug-In Inversion, which relies on a simple set of augmentations and does not require excessive hyper-parameter tuning. Under our proposed augmentation-based scheme, the same set of augmentation hyper-parameters can be used for inverting a wide range of image classification models, regardless of input dimensions or the architecture. We illustrate the practicality of our approach by inverting Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on the ImageNet dataset, tasks which to the best of our knowledge have not been successfully accomplished by any previous works.      
### 24.Deep Learning Approaches on Image Captioning: A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12944.pdf)
>  Automatic image captioning, which involves describing the contents of an image, is a challenging problem with many applications in various research fields. One notable example is designing assistants for the visually impaired. Recently, there have been significant advances in image captioning methods owing to the breakthroughs in deep learning. This survey paper aims to provide a structured review of recent image captioning techniques, and their performance, focusing mainly on deep learning methods. We also review widely-used datasets and performance metrics, in addition to the discussions on open problems and unsolved challenges in image captioning.      
### 25.Aggregating Global Features into Local Vision Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12903.pdf)
>  Local Transformer-based classification models have recently achieved promising results with relatively low computational costs. However, the effect of aggregating spatial global information of local Transformer-based architecture is not clear. This work investigates the outcome of applying a global attention-based module named multi-resolution overlapped attention (MOA) in the local window-based transformer after each stage. The proposed MOA employs slightly larger and overlapped patches in the key to enable neighborhood pixel information transmission, which leads to significant performance gain. In addition, we thoroughly investigate the effect of the dimension of essential architecture components through extensive experiments and discover an optimum architecture design. Extensive experimental results CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms previous vision Transformers with a comparatively fewer number of parameters.      
### 26.A Dataset for Medical Instructional Video Classification and Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12888.pdf)
>  This paper introduces a new challenge and datasets to foster research toward designing systems that can understand medical videos and provide visual answers to natural language questions. We believe medical videos may provide the best possible answers to many first aids, medical emergency, and medical education questions. Toward this, we created the MedVidCL and MedVidQA datasets and introduce the tasks of Medical Video Classification (MVC) and Medical Visual Answer Localization (MVAL), two tasks that focus on cross-modal (medical language and medical video) understanding. The proposed tasks and datasets have the potential to support the development of sophisticated downstream applications that can benefit the public and medical practitioners. Our datasets consist of 6,117 annotated videos for the MVC task and 3,010 annotated questions and answers timestamps from 899 videos for the MVAL task. These datasets have been verified and corrected by medical informatics experts. We have also benchmarked each task with the created MedVidCL and MedVidQA datasets and proposed the multimodal learning methods that set competitive baselines for future research.      
### 27.Comprehensive Saliency Fusion for Object Co-segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12828.pdf)
>  Object co-segmentation has drawn significant attention in recent years, thanks to its clarity on the expected foreground, the shared object in a group of images. Saliency fusion has been one of the promising ways to carry it out. However, prior works either fuse saliency maps of the same image or saliency maps of different images to extract the expected foregrounds. Also, they rely on hand-crafted saliency extraction and correspondence processes in most cases. This paper revisits the problem and proposes fusing saliency maps of both the same image and different images. It also leverages advances in deep learning for the saliency extraction and correspondence processes. Hence, we call it comprehensive saliency fusion. Our experiments reveal that our approach achieves much-improved object co-segmentation results compared to prior works on important benchmark datasets such as iCoseg, MSRC, and Internet Images.      
### 28.Optimizing Gradient-driven Criteria in Network Sparsity: Gradient is All You Need  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12826.pdf)
>  Network sparsity receives popularity mostly due to its capability to reduce the network complexity. Extensive studies excavate gradient-driven sparsity. Typically, these methods are constructed upon premise of weight independence, which however, is contrary to the fact that weights are mutually influenced. Thus, their performance remains to be improved. In this paper, we propose to further optimize gradient-driven sparsity (OptG) by solving this independence paradox. Our motive comes from the recent advances on supermask training which shows that sparse subnetworks can be located in a randomly initialized network by simply updating mask values without modifying any weight. We prove that supermask training is to accumulate the weight gradients and can partly solve the independence paradox. Consequently, OptG integrates supermask training into gradient-driven sparsity, and a specialized mask optimizer is designed to solve the independence paradox. Experiments show that OptG can well surpass many existing state-of-the-art competitors.

### 29.Contrastive Learning from Demonstrations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12813.pdf)
>  This paper presents a framework for learning visual representations from unlabeled video demonstrations captured from multiple viewpoints. We show that these representations are applicable for imitating several robotic tasks, including pick and place. We optimize a recently proposed self-supervised learning algorithm by applying contrastive learning to enhance task-relevant information while suppressing irrelevant information in the feature embeddings. We validate the proposed method on the publicly available Multi-View Pouring and a custom Pick and Place data sets and compare it with the TCN triplet baseline. We evaluate the learned representations using three metrics: viewpoint alignment, stage classification and reinforcement learning, and in all cases the results improve when compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with the added benefit of reduced number of training iterations.      
### 30.Automatic Segmentation of Left Ventricle in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12805.pdf)
>  Segmentation of the left ventricle in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans enables cardiologists to calculate the volume of the left ventricle and subsequently its ejection fraction. The ejection fraction is a measurement that expresses the percentage of blood leaving the heart with each contraction. Cardiologists often use ejection fraction to determine one's cardiac function. We propose multiscale template matching technique for detection and an elliptical active disc for automated segmentation of the left ventricle in MR images. The elliptical active disc optimizes the local energy function with respect to its five free parameters which define the disc. Gradient descent is used to minimize the energy function along with Green's theorem to optimize the computation expenses. We report validations on 320 scans containing 5,273 annotated slices which are publicly available through the Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor, and Multi-Disease Cardiac Segmentation (M&amp;Ms) Challenge. We achieved successful localization of the left ventricle in 89.63% of the cases and a Dice coefficient of 0.873 on diastole slices and 0.770 on systole slices. The proposed technique is based on traditional image processing techniques with a performance on par with the deep learning techniques.      
### 31.SelfRecon: Self Reconstruction Your Digital Avatar from Monocular Video  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12792.pdf)
>  We propose SelfRecon, a clothed human body reconstruction method that combines implicit and explicit representations to recover space-time coherent geometries from a monocular self-rotating human video. Explicit methods require a predefined template mesh for a given sequence, while the template is hard to acquire for a specific subject. Meanwhile, the fixed topology limits the reconstruction accuracy and clothing types. Implicit methods support arbitrary topology and have high quality due to continuous geometric representation. However, it is difficult to integrate multi-frame information to produce a consistent registration sequence for downstream applications. We propose to combine the advantages of both representations. We utilize differential mask loss of the explicit mesh to obtain the coherent overall shape, while the details on the implicit surface are refined with the differentiable neural rendering. Meanwhile, the explicit mesh is updated periodically to adjust its topology changes, and a consistency loss is designed to match both representations closely. Compared with existing methods, SelfRecon can produce high-fidelity surfaces for arbitrary clothed humans with self-supervised optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on real captured monocular videos.      
### 32.Self-Supervised Moving Vehicle Detection from Audio-Visual Cues  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12771.pdf)
>  Robust detection of moving vehicles is a critical task for any autonomously operating outdoor robot or self-driving vehicle. Most modern approaches for solving this task rely on training image-based detectors using large-scale vehicle detection datasets such as nuScenes or the Waymo Open Dataset. Providing manual annotations is an expensive and laborious exercise that does not scale well in practice. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised approach that leverages audio-visual cues to detect moving vehicles in videos. Our approach employs contrastive learning for localizing vehicles in images from corresponding pairs of images and recorded audio. In extensive experiments carried out with a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our approach provides accurate detections of moving vehicles and does not require manual annotations. We furthermore show that our model can be used as a teacher to supervise an audio-only detection model. This student model is invariant to illumination changes and thus effectively bridges the domain gap inherent to models leveraging exclusively vision as the predominant modality.      
### 33.MVP-Net: Multiple View Pointwise Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12769.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud is an essential task for autonomous driving environment perception. The pipeline of most pointwise point cloud semantic segmentation methods includes points sampling, neighbor searching, feature aggregation, and classification. Neighbor searching method like K-nearest neighbors algorithm, KNN, has been widely applied. However, the complexity of KNN is always a bottleneck of efficiency. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural architecture, Multiple View Pointwise Net, MVP-Net, to efficiently and directly infer large-scale outdoor point cloud without KNN or any complex pre/postprocessing. Instead, assumption-based sorting and multi-rotation of point cloud methods are introduced to point feature aggregation and receptive field expanding. Numerical experiments show that the proposed MVP-Net is 11 times faster than the most efficient pointwise semantic segmentation method RandLA-Net and achieves the same accuracy on the large-scale benchmark SemanticKITTI dataset.      
### 34.Improving Corruption and Adversarial Robustness by Enhancing Weak Subnets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12765.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks. However, deep networks have been shown to be very susceptible to corrupted or adversarial images, which often result in significant performance drops. In this paper, we observe that weak subnetwork (subnet) performance is correlated with a lack of robustness against corruptions and adversarial attacks. Based on that observation, we propose a novel robust training method which explicitly identifies and enhances weak subnets (EWS) during training to improve robustness. Specifically, we develop a search algorithm to find particularly weak subnets and propose to explicitly strengthen them via knowledge distillation from the full network. We show that our EWS greatly improves the robustness against corrupted images as well as the accuracy on clean data. Being complementary to many state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches, EWS consistently improves corruption robustness on top of many of these approaches. Moreover, EWS is also able to boost the adversarial robustness when combined with popular adversarial training methods.      
### 35.RIM-Net: Recursive Implicit Fields for Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Shape Structures  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12763.pdf)
>  We introduce RIM-Net, a neural network which learns recursive implicit fields for unsupervised inference of hierarchical shape structures. Our network recursively decomposes an input 3D shape into two parts, resulting in a binary tree hierarchy. Each level of the tree corresponds to an assembly of shape parts, represented as implicit functions, to reconstruct the input shape. At each node of the tree, simultaneous feature decoding and shape decomposition are carried out by their respective feature and part decoders, with weight sharing across the same hierarchy level. As an implicit field decoder, the part decoder is designed to decompose a sub-shape, via a two-way branched reconstruction, where each branch predicts a set of parameters defining a Gaussian to serve as a local point distribution for shape reconstruction. With reconstruction losses accounted for at each hierarchy level and a decomposition loss at each node, our network training does not require any ground-truth segmentations, let alone hierarchies. Through extensive experiments and comparisons to state-of-the-art alternatives, we demonstrate the quality, consistency, and interpretability of hierarchical structural inference by RIM-Net.      
### 36.TPC: Transformation-Specific Smoothing for Point Cloud Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12733.pdf)
>  Point cloud models with neural network architectures have achieved great success and have been widely used in safety-critical applications, such as Lidar-based recognition systems in autonomous vehicles. However, such models are shown vulnerable against adversarial attacks which aim to apply stealthy semantic transformations such as rotation and tapering to mislead model predictions. In this paper, we propose a transformation-specific smoothing framework TPC, which provides tight and scalable robustness guarantees for point cloud models against semantic transformation attacks. We first categorize common 3D transformations into three categories: additive (e.g., shearing), composable (e.g., rotation), and indirectly composable (e.g., tapering), and we present generic robustness certification strategies for all categories respectively. We then specify unique certification protocols for a range of specific semantic transformations and their compositions. Extensive experiments on several common 3D transformations show that TPC significantly outperforms the state of the art. For example, our framework boosts the certified accuracy against twisting transformation along z-axis (within 20$^\circ$) from 20.3$\%$ to 83.8$\%$.      
### 37.Video-based Facial Micro-Expression Analysis: A Survey of Datasets, Features and Algorithms  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12728.pdf)
>  Unlike the conventional facial expressions, micro-expressions are involuntary and transient facial expressions capable of revealing the genuine emotions that people attempt to hide. Therefore, they can provide important information in a broad range of applications such as lie detection, criminal detection, etc. Since micro-expressions are transient and of low intensity, however, their detection and recognition is difficult and relies heavily on expert experiences. Due to its intrinsic particularity and complexity, video-based micro-expression analysis is attractive but challenging, and has recently become an active area of research. Although there have been numerous developments in this area, thus far there has been no comprehensive survey that provides researchers with a systematic overview of these developments with a unified evaluation. Accordingly, in this survey paper, we first highlight the key differences between macro- and micro-expressions, then use these differences to guide our research survey of video-based micro-expression analysis in a cascaded structure, encompassing the neuropsychological basis, datasets, features, spotting algorithms, recognition algorithms, applications and evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches. For each aspect, the basic techniques, advanced developments and major challenges are addressed and discussed. Furthermore, after considering the limitations of existing micro-expression datasets, we present and release a new dataset - called micro-and-macro expression warehouse (MMEW) - containing more video samples and more labeled emotion types. We then perform a unified comparison of representative methods on CAS(ME)2 for spotting, and on MMEW and SAMM for recognition, respectively. Finally, some potential future research directions are explored and outlined.      
### 38.Neural Architecture Ranker  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12725.pdf)
>  Architecture ranking has recently been advocated to design an efficient and effective performance predictor for Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The previous contrastive method solves the ranking problem by comparing pairs of architectures and predicting their relative performance, which may suffer generalization issues due to local pair-wise comparison. Inspired by the quality stratification phenomenon in the search space, we propose a predictor, namely Neural Architecture Ranker (NAR), from a new and global perspective by exploiting the quality distribution of the whole search space. The NAR learns the similar characteristics of the same quality tier (i.e., level) and distinguishes among different individuals by first matching architectures with the representation of tiers, and then classifying and scoring them. It can capture the features of different quality tiers and thus generalize its ranking ability to the entire search space. Besides, distributions of different quality tiers are also beneficial to guide the sampling procedure, which is free of training a search algorithm and thus simplifies the NAS pipeline. The proposed NAR achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on two widely accepted datasets. On NAS-Bench-101, it finds the architectures with top 0.01$\unicode{x2030}$ performance among the search space and stably focuses on the top architectures. On NAS-Bench-201, it identifies the optimal architectures on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and, ImageNet-16-120. We expand and release these two datasets covering detailed cell computational information to boost the study of NAS.      
### 39.VC-GPT: Visual Conditioned GPT for End-to-End Generative Vision-and-Language Pre-training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12723.pdf)
>  Vision-and-language pre-training models (VLMs) have achieved tremendous success in the cross-modal area, but most of them require millions of parallel image-caption data for pre-training. Collating such data is expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we focus on reducing such need for generative vision-and-language pre-training (G-VLP) by taking advantage of the visual pre-trained model (CLIP-ViT) as encoder and language pre-trained model (GPT2) as decoder. Unfortunately, GPT2 lacks a necessary cross-attention module, which hinders the direct connection of CLIP-ViT and GPT2. To remedy such defects, we conduct extensive experiments to empirically investigate how to design and pre-train our model. Based on our experimental results, we propose a novel G-VLP framework, Visual Conditioned GPT (VC-GPT), and pre-train it with a small-scale parallel image-caption corpus (Visual Genome, only 110k distinct images). Evaluating on the image captioning downstream tasks (MSCOCO and Flickr30k Captioning), VC-GPT achieves either the best or the second-best performance across all evaluation metrics over the previous works which consume around 30 times more parallel data during pre-training.      
### 40.Win the Lottery Ticket via Fourier Analysis: Frequencies Guided Network Pruning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12712.pdf)
>  With the remarkable success of deep learning recently, efficient network compression algorithms are urgently demanded for releasing the potential computational power of edge devices, such as smartphones or tablets. However, optimal network pruning is a non-trivial task which mathematically is an NP-hard problem. Previous researchers explain training a pruned network as buying a lottery ticket. In this paper, we investigate the Magnitude-Based Pruning (MBP) scheme and analyze it from a novel perspective through Fourier analysis on the deep learning model to guide model designation. Besides explaining the generalization ability of MBP using Fourier transform, we also propose a novel two-stage pruning approach, where one stage is to obtain the topological structure of the pruned network and the other stage is to retrain the pruned network to recover the capacity using knowledge distillation from lower to higher on the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate the superiority of our novel Fourier analysis based MBP compared to other traditional MBP algorithms.      
### 41.Tensor Recovery Based on Tensor Equivalent Minimax-Concave Penalty  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12709.pdf)
>  Tensor recovery is an important problem in computer vision and machine learning. It usually uses the convex relaxation of tensor rank and $l_{0}$ norm, i.e., the nuclear norm and $l_{1}$ norm respectively, to solve the problem. It is well known that convex approximations produce biased estimators. In order to overcome this problem, a corresponding non-convex regularizer has been proposed to solve it. Inspired by matrix equivalent Minimax-Concave Penalty (EMCP), we propose and prove theorems of tensor equivalent Minimax-Concave Penalty (TEMCP). The tensor equivalent MCP (TEMCP) as a non-convex regularizer and the equivalent weighted tensor $\gamma$ norm (EWTGN) which can represent the low-rank part are obtained. Both of them can realize weight adaptive. At the same time, we propose two corresponding adaptive models for two classical tensor recovery problems, low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) and tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA), and the optimization algorithm is based on alternating direction multiplier (ADMM). This novel iterative adaptive algorithm can produce more accurate tensor recovery effect. For the tensor completion model, multispectral image (MSI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and color video (CV) data sets are considered, while for the tensor robust principal component analysis model, hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising under gaussian noise plus salt and pepper noise is considered. The proposed algorithm is superior to the state-of-arts method, and the algorithm is guaranteed to meet the reduction and convergence through experiments.      
### 42.A Robust Framework for Deep Learning Approaches to Facial Emotion Recognition and Evaluation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12705.pdf)
>  Facial emotion recognition is a vast and complex problem space within the domain of computer vision and thus requires a universally accepted baseline method with which to evaluate proposed models. While test datasets have served this purpose in the academic sphere real world application and testing of such models lacks any real comparison. Therefore we propose a framework in which models developed for FER can be compared and contrasted against one another in a constant standardized fashion. A lightweight convolutional neural network is trained on the AffectNet dataset a large variable dataset for facial emotion recognition and a web application is developed and deployed with our proposed framework as a proof of concept. The CNN is embedded into our application and is capable of instant real time facial emotion recognition. When tested on the AffectNet test set this model achieves high accuracy for emotion classification of eight different emotions. Using our framework the validity of this model and others can be properly tested by evaluating a model efficacy not only based on its accuracy on a sample test dataset, but also on in the wild experiments. Additionally, our application is built with the ability to save and store any image captured or uploaded to it for emotion recognition, allowing for the curation of more quality and diverse facial emotion recognition datasets.      
### 43.Extracting Built Environment Features for Planning Research with Computer Vision: A Review and Discussion of State-of-the-Art Approaches  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12693.pdf)
>  This is an extended abstract for a presentation at The 17th International Conference on CUPUM - Computational Urban Planning and Urban Management in June 2021. This study presents an interdisciplinary synthesis of the state-of-the-art approaches in computer vision technologies to extract built environment features that could improve the robustness of empirical research in planning. We discussed the findings from the review of studies in both planning and computer science.      
### 44.Transfer Learning for Estimation of Pendubot Angular Position Using Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12649.pdf)
>  In this paper, a machine learning based approach is introduced to estimate Pendubot angular position from its captured images. Initially, a baseline algorithm is introduced to estimate the angle using conventional image processing technique. The baseline algorithm performs well for the cases that the Pendubot is not moving fast. However, when moving quickly due to a free fall, the Pendubot appears as a blurred object in the captured image in a way that the baseline algorithm fails to estimate the angle. Consequently, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based algorithm is introduced to cope with this challenge. The approach relies on the concept of transfer learning to allow the training of the DNN on a very small fine-tuning dataset. The base algorithm is used to create the ground truth labels of the fine-tuning dataset. Experimental results on the held-out evaluation set show that the proposed approach achieves a median absolute error of 0.02 and 0.06 degrees for the sharp and blurry images respectively.      
### 45.Self Semi Supervised Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12646.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a Neural Architecture Search strategy based on self supervision and semi-supervised learning for the task of semantic segmentation. Our approach builds an optimized neural network (NN) model for this task by jointly solving a jigsaw pretext task discovered with self-supervised learning over unlabeled training data, and, exploiting the structure of the unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning. The search of the architecture of the NN model is performed by dynamic routing using a gradient descent algorithm. Experiments on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate that the discovered neural network is more efficient than a state-of-the-art hand-crafted NN model with four times less floating operations.      
### 46.Image Classification using Graph Neural Network and Multiscale Wavelet Superpixels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12633.pdf)
>  Prior studies using graph neural networks (GNNs) for image classification have focused on graphs generated from a regular grid of pixels or similar-sized superpixels. In the latter, a single target number of superpixels is defined for an entire dataset irrespective of differences across images and their intrinsic multiscale structure. On the contrary, this study investigates image classification using graphs generated from an image-specific number of multiscale superpixels. We propose WaveMesh, a new wavelet-based superpixeling algorithm, where the number and sizes of superpixels in an image are systematically computed based on its content. WaveMesh superpixel graphs are structurally different from similar-sized superpixel graphs. We use SplineCNN, a state-of-the-art network for image graph classification, to compare WaveMesh and similar-sized superpixels. Using SplineCNN, we perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets under three local-pooling settings: 1) no pooling, 2) GraclusPool, and 3) WavePool, a novel spatially heterogeneous pooling scheme tailored to WaveMesh superpixels. Our experiments demonstrate that SplineCNN learns from multiscale WaveMesh superpixels on-par with similar-sized superpixels. In all WaveMesh experiments, GraclusPool performs poorer than no pooling / WavePool, indicating that poor choice of pooling can result in inferior performance while learning from multiscale superpixels.      
### 47.Assessing Cross-dataset Generalization of Pedestrian Crossing Predictors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12626.pdf)
>  Pedestrian crossing prediction has been a topic of active research, resulting in many new algorithmic solutions. While measuring the overall progress of those solutions over time tends to be more and more established due to the new publicly available benchmark and standardized evaluation procedures, knowing how well existing predictors react to unseen data remains an unanswered question. This evaluation is imperative as serviceable crossing behavior predictors should be set to work in various scenarii without compromising pedestrian safety due to misprediction. To this end, we conduct a study based on direct cross-dataset evaluation. Our experiments show that current state-of-the-art pedestrian behavior predictors generalize poorly in cross-dataset evaluation scenarii, regardless of their robustness during a direct training-test set evaluation setting. In the light of what we observe, we argue that the future of pedestrian crossing prediction, e.g. reliable and generalizable implementations, should not be about tailoring models, trained with very little available data, and tested in a classical train-test scenario with the will to infer anything about their behavior in real life. It should be about evaluating models in a cross-dataset setting while considering their uncertainty estimates under domain shift.      
### 48.ADC-Net: An Open-Source Deep Learning Network for Automated Dispersion Compensation in Optical Coherence Tomography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12625.pdf)
>  Chromatic dispersion is a common problem to degrade the system resolution in optical coherence tomography (OCT). This study is to develop a deep learning network for automated dispersion compensation (ADC-Net) in OCT. The ADC-Net is based on a redesigned UNet architecture which employs an encoder-decoder pipeline. The input section encompasses partially compensated OCT B-scans with individual retinal layers optimized. Corresponding output is a fully compensated OCT B-scans with all retinal layers optimized. Two numeric parameters, i.e., peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index metric computed at multiple scales (MS-SSIM), were used for objective assessment of the ADC-Net performance. Comparative analysis of training models, including single, three, five, seven and nine input channels were implemented. The five-input channels implementation was observed as the optimal mode for ADC-Net training to achieve robust dispersion compensation in OCT      
### 49.Hand Gesture Recognition of Dumb Person Using one Against All Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12622.pdf)
>  We propose a new technique for recognition of dumb person hand gesture in real world environment. In this technique, the hand image containing the gesture is preprocessed and then hand region is segmented by convergent the RGB color image to L.a.b color space. Only few statistical features are used to classify the segmented image to different classes. Artificial Neural Network is trained in sequential manner using one against all. When the system gets trained, it becomes capable of recognition of each class in parallel manner. The result of proposed technique is much better than existing techniques.      
### 50.Semantic-assisted image compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12599.pdf)
>  Conventional image compression methods typically aim at pixel-level consistency while ignoring the performance of downstream AI <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://tasks.To" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> solve this problem, this paper proposes a Semantic-Assisted Image Compression method (SAIC), which can maintain semantic-level consistency to enable high performance of downstream AI <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://tasks.To" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> this end, we train the compression network using semantic-level loss function. In particular, semantic-level loss is measured using gradient-based semantic weights mechanism (GSW). GSW directly consider downstream AI tasks' perceptual results. Then, this paper proposes a semantic-level distortion evaluation metric to quantify the amount of semantic information retained during the compression process. Experimental results show that the proposed SAIC method can retain more semantic-level information and achieve better performance of downstream AI tasks compared to the traditional deep learning-based method and the advanced perceptual method at the same compression ratio.      
### 51.MVP: Multi-Stage Vision-Language Pre-Training via Multi-Level Semantic Alignment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12596.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a Multi-stage Vision-language Pre-training (MVP) framework to learn cross-modality representation via multi-level semantic alignment. We introduce concepts in both modalities to construct two-level semantic representations for language and vision. Based on the multi-level input, we train the cross-modality model in two stages, namely, uni-modal learning and cross-modal learning. The former stage enforces within-modality interactions to learn multi-level semantics for each single modality. The latter stage enforces interactions across modalities via both coarse-grain and fine-grain semantic alignment tasks. Image-text matching and masked language modeling are then used to further optimize the pre-training model. Our model generates the-state-of-the-art results on several vision and language tasks.      
### 52.Exact Decomposition of Joint Low Rankness and Local Smoothness Plus Sparse Matrices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12592.pdf)
>  It is known that the decomposition in low-rank and sparse matrices (\textbf{L+S} for short) can be achieved by several Robust PCA techniques. Besides the low rankness, the local smoothness (\textbf{LSS}) is a vitally essential prior for many real-world matrix data such as hyperspectral images and surveillance videos, which makes such matrices have low-rankness and local smoothness properties at the same time. This poses an interesting question: Can we make a matrix decomposition in terms of \textbf{L\&amp;LSS +S } form exactly? To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new RPCA model based on three-dimensional correlated total variation regularization (3DCTV-RPCA for short) by fully exploiting and encoding the prior expression underlying such joint low-rank and local smoothness matrices. Specifically, using a modification of Golfing scheme, we prove that under some mild assumptions, the proposed 3DCTV-RPCA model can decompose both components exactly, which should be the first theoretical guarantee among all such related methods combining low rankness and local smoothness. In addition, by utilizing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we propose an efficient ADMM algorithm with a solid convergence guarantee for solving the resulting optimization problem. Finally, a series of experiments on both simulations and real applications are carried out to demonstrate the general validity of the proposed 3DCTV-RPCA model.      
### 53.Scale-arbitrary Invertible Image Downscaling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12576.pdf)
>  Downscaling is indispensable when distributing high-resolution (HR) images over the Internet to fit the displays of various resolutions, while upscaling is also necessary when users want to see details of the distributed images. Recent invertible image downscaling methods jointly model these two problems and achieve significant improvements. However, they only consider fixed integer scale factors that cannot meet the requirement of conveniently fitting the displays of various resolutions in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a scale-Arbitrary Invertible image Downscaling Network (AIDN), to natively downscale HR images with arbitrary scale factors for fitting various target resolutions. Meanwhile, the HR information is embedded in the downscaled low-resolution (LR) counterparts in a nearly imperceptible form such that our AIDN can also restore the original HR images solely from the LR images. The key to supporting arbitrary scale factors is our proposed Conditional Resampling Module (CRM) that conditions the downscaling/upscaling kernels and sampling locations on both scale factors and image content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our AIDN achieves top performance for invertible downscaling with both arbitrary integer and non-integer scale factors.      
### 54.Task-Balanced Batch Normalization for Exemplar-based Class-Incremental Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12559.pdf)
>  Batch Normalization (BN) is an essential layer for training neural network models in various computer vision tasks. It has been widely used in continual learning scenarios with little discussion, but we find that BN should be carefully applied, particularly for the exemplar memory based class incremental learning (CIL). We first analyze that the empirical mean and variance obtained for normalization in a BN layer become highly biased toward the current task. To tackle its significant problems in training and test phases, we propose Task-Balanced Batch Normalization (TBBN). Given each mini-batch imbalanced between the current and previous tasks, TBBN first reshapes and repeats the batch, calculating near task-balanced mean and variance. Second, we show that when the affine transformation parameters of BN are learned from a reshaped feature map, they become less-biased toward the current task. Based on our extensive CIL experiments with CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 datasets, we demonstrate that our TBBN is easily applicable to most of existing exemplar-based CIL algorithms, improving their performance by decreasing the forgetting on the previous tasks.      
### 55.The KFIoU Loss for Rotated Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12558.pdf)
>  Differing from the well-developed horizontal object detection area whereby the computing-friendly IoU based loss is readily adopted and well fits with the detection metrics. In contrast, rotation detectors often involve a more complicated loss based on SkewIoU which is unfriendly to gradient-based training. In this paper, we argue that one effective alternative is to devise an approximate loss who can achieve trend-level alignment with SkewIoU loss instead of the strict value-level identity. Specifically, we model the objects as Gaussian distribution and adopt Kalman filter to inherently mimic the mechanism of SkewIoU by its definition, and show its alignment with the SkewIoU at trend-level. This is in contrast to recent Gaussian modeling based rotation detectors e.g. GWD, KLD that involves a human-specified distribution distance metric which requires additional hyperparameter tuning. The resulting new loss called KFIoU is easier to implement and works better compared with exact SkewIoU, thanks to its full differentiability and ability to handle the non-overlapping cases. We further extend our technique to the 3-D case which also suffers from the same issues as 2-D detection. Extensive results on various public datasets (2-D/3-D, aerial/text/face images) with different base detectors show the effectiveness of our approach.      
### 56.Fast Differentiable Matrix Square Root and Inverse Square Root  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12543.pdf)
>  Computing the matrix square root and its inverse in a differentiable manner is important in a variety of computer vision tasks. Previous methods either adopt the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to explicitly factorize the matrix or use the Newton-Schulz iteration (NS iteration) to derive the approximate solution. However, both methods are not computationally efficient enough in either the forward pass or the backward pass. In this paper, we propose two more efficient variants to compute the differentiable matrix square root and the inverse square root. For the forward propagation, one method is to use Matrix Taylor Polynomial (MTP), and the other method is to use Matrix Padé Approximants (MPA). The backward gradient is computed by iteratively solving the continuous-time Lyapunov equation using the matrix sign function. A series of numerical tests show that both methods yield considerable speed-up compared with the SVD or the NS iteration. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of our methods in several real-world applications, including de-correlated batch normalization, second-order vision transformer, global covariance pooling for large-scale and fine-grained recognition, attentive covariance pooling for video recognition, and neural style transfer. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods can also achieve competitive and even slightly better performances.

### 57.Light field Rectification based on relative pose estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12533.pdf)
>  Hand-held light field (LF) cameras have unique advantages in computer vision such as 3D scene reconstruction and depth estimation. However, the related applications are limited by the ultra-small baseline, e.g., leading to the extremely low depth resolution in reconstruction. To solve this problem, we propose to rectify LF to obtain a large baseline. Specifically, the proposed method aligns two LFs captured by two hand-held LF cameras with a random relative pose, and extracts the corresponding row-aligned sub-aperture images (SAIs) to obtain an LF with a large baseline. For an accurate rectification, a method for pose estimation is also proposed, where the relative rotation and translation between the two LF cameras are estimated. The proposed pose estimation minimizes the degree of freedom (DoF) in the LF-point-LF-point correspondence model and explicitly solves this model in a linear way. The proposed pose estimation outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by providing more accurate results to support rectification. The significantly improved depth resolution in 3D reconstruction demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed LF rectification.      
### 58.SupWMA: Consistent and Efficient Tractography Parcellation of Superficial White Matter with Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12528.pdf)
>  White matter parcellation classifies tractography streamlines into clusters or anatomically meaningful tracts to enable quantification and visualization. Most parcellation methods focus on the deep white matter (DWM), while fewer methods address the superficial white matter (SWM) due to its complexity. We propose a deep-learning-based framework, Superficial White Matter Analysis (SupWMA), that performs an efficient and consistent parcellation of 198 SWM clusters from whole-brain tractography. A point-cloud-based network is modified for our SWM parcellation task, and supervised contrastive learning enables more discriminative representations between plausible streamlines and outliers. We perform evaluation on a large tractography dataset with ground truth labels and on three independently acquired testing datasets from individuals across ages and health conditions. Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, SupWMA obtains a highly consistent and accurate SWM parcellation result. In addition, the computational speed of SupWMA is much faster than other methods.      
### 59.Scale-Invariant Adversarial Attack for Evaluating and Enhancing Adversarial Defenses  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12527.pdf)
>  Efficient and effective attacks are crucial for reliable evaluation of defenses, and also for developing robust models. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack has been demonstrated to be one of the most successful adversarial attacks. However, the effect of the standard PGD attack can be easily weakened by rescaling the logits, while the original decision of every input will not be changed. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose Scale-Invariant Adversarial Attack (SI-PGD), which utilizes the angle between the features in the penultimate layer and the weights in the softmax layer to guide the generation of adversaries. The cosine angle matrix is used to learn angularly discriminative representation and will not be changed with the rescaling of logits, thus making SI-PGD attack to be stable and effective. We evaluate our attack against multiple defenses and show improved performance when compared with existing attacks. Further, we propose Scale-Invariant (SI) adversarial defense mechanism based on the cosine angle matrix, which can be embedded into the popular adversarial defenses. The experimental results show the defense method with our SI mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance among multi-step and single-step defenses.      
### 60.Spherical Convolution empowered FoV Prediction in 360-degree Video Multicast with Limited FoV Feedback  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12525.pdf)
>  Field of view (FoV) prediction is critical in 360-degree video multicast, which is a key component of the emerging Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Most of the current prediction methods combining saliency detection and FoV information neither take into account that the distortion of projected 360-degree videos can invalidate the weight sharing of traditional convolutional networks, nor do they adequately consider the difficulty of obtaining complete multi-user FoV information, which degrades the prediction performance. This paper proposes a spherical convolution-empowered FoV prediction method, which is a multi-source prediction framework combining salient features extracted from 360-degree video with limited FoV feedback information. A spherical convolution neural network (CNN) is used instead of a traditional two-dimensional CNN to eliminate the problem of weight sharing failure caused by video projection distortion. Specifically, salient spatial-temporal features are extracted through a spherical convolution-based saliency detection model, after which the limited feedback FoV information is represented as a time-series model based on a spherical convolution-empowered gated recurrent unit network. Finally, the extracted salient video features are combined to predict future user FoVs. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is better than other prediction methods.      
### 61.2D+3D facial expression recognition via embedded tensor manifold regularization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12506.pdf)
>  In this paper, a novel approach via embedded tensor manifold regularization for 2D+3D facial expression recognition (FERETMR) is proposed. Firstly, 3D tensors are constructed from 2D face images and 3D face shape models to keep the structural information and correlations. To maintain the local structure (geometric information) of 3D tensor samples in the low-dimensional tensors space during the dimensionality reduction, the $\ell_0$-norm of the core tensors and a tensor manifold regularization scheme embedded on core tensors are adopted via a low-rank truncated Tucker decomposition on the generated tensors. As a result, the obtained factor matrices will be used for facial expression classification prediction. To make the resulting tensor optimization more tractable, $\ell_1$-norm surrogate is employed to relax $\ell_0$-norm and hence the resulting tensor optimization problem has a nonsmooth objective function due to the $\ell_1$-norm and orthogonal constraints from the orthogonal Tucker decomposition. To efficiently tackle this tensor optimization problem, we establish the first-order optimality condition in terms of stationary points, and then design a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm with convergence analysis and the computational complexity. Numerical results on BU-3DFE database and Bosphorus databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.      
### 62.Reconstruction of Power Lines from Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12499.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a novel solution for constructing line features modeling each catenary curve present within a series of points representing multiple catenary curves. The solution can be applied to extract power lines from lidar point clouds, which can then be used in downstream applications like creating digital twin geospatial models and evaluating the encroachment of vegetation. This paper offers an example of how the results obtained by the proposed solution could be used to assess vegetation growth near transmission power lines based on freely available lidar data for the City of Utrecht, Netherlands [1].      
### 63.Improving Federated Learning Face Recognition via Privacy-Agnostic Clusters  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12467.pdf)
>  The growing public concerns on data privacy in face recognition can be greatly addressed by the federated learning (FL) paradigm. However, conventional FL methods perform poorly due to the uniqueness of the task: broadcasting class centers among clients is crucial for recognition performances but leads to privacy leakage. To resolve the privacy-utility paradox, this work proposes PrivacyFace, a framework largely improves the federated learning face recognition via communicating auxiliary and privacy-agnostic information among clients. PrivacyFace mainly consists of two components: First, a practical Differentially Private Local Clustering (DPLC) mechanism is proposed to distill sanitized clusters from local class centers. Second, a consensus-aware recognition loss subsequently encourages global consensuses among clients, which ergo results in more discriminative features. The proposed framework is mathematically proved to be differentially private, introducing a lightweight overhead as well as yielding prominent performance boosts (\textit{e.g.}, +9.63\% and +10.26\% for TAR@FAR=1e-4 on IJB-B and IJB-C respectively). Extensive experiments and ablation studies on a large-scale dataset have demonstrated the efficacy and practicability of our method.      
### 64.Task-Focused Few-Shot Object Detection for Robot Manipulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12437.pdf)
>  This paper addresses the problem of mobile robot manipulation of novel objects via detection. Our approach uses vision and control as complementary functions that learn from real-world tasks. We develop a manipulation method based solely on detection then introduce task-focused few-shot object detection to learn new objects and settings. The current paradigm for few-shot object detection uses existing annotated examples. In contrast, we extend this paradigm by using active data collection and annotation selection that improves performance for specific downstream tasks (e.g., depth estimation and grasping). In experiments for our interactive approach to few-shot learning, we train a robot to manipulate objects directly from detection (ClickBot). ClickBot learns visual servo control from a single click of annotation, grasps novel objects in clutter and other settings, and achieves state-of-the-art results on an existing visual servo control and depth estimation benchmark. Finally, we establish a task-focused few-shot object detection benchmark to support future research: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/griffbr/TFOD" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 65.CoordX: Accelerating Implicit Neural Representation with a Split MLP Architecture  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12425.pdf)
>  Implicit neural representations with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) have recently gained prominence for a wide variety of tasks such as novel view synthesis and 3D object representation and rendering. However, a significant challenge with these representations is that both training and inference with an MLP over a large number of input coordinates to learn and represent an image, video, or 3D object, require large amounts of computation and incur long processing times. In this work, we aim to accelerate inference and training of coordinate-based MLPs for implicit neural representations by proposing a new split MLP architecture, CoordX. With CoordX, the initial layers are split to learn each dimension of the input coordinates separately. The intermediate features are then fused by the last layers to generate the learned signal at the corresponding coordinate point. This significantly reduces the amount of computation required and leads to large speedups in training and inference, while achieving similar accuracy as the baseline MLP. This approach thus aims at first learning functions that are a decomposition of the original signal and then fusing them to generate the learned signal. Our proposed architecture can be generally used for many implicit neural representation tasks with no additional memory overheads. We demonstrate a speedup of up to 2.92x compared to the baseline model for image, video, and 3D shape representation and rendering tasks.      
### 66.Few-shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Multi-modal Cardiac Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12386.pdf)
>  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods intend to reduce the gap between source and target domains by using unlabeled target domain and labeled source domain data, however, in the medical domain, target domain data may not always be easily available, and acquiring new samples is generally time-consuming. This restricts the development of UDA methods for new domains. In this paper, we explore the potential of UDA in a more challenging while realistic scenario where only one unlabeled target patient sample is available. We call it Few-shot Unsupervised Domain adaptation (FUDA). We first generate target-style images from source images and explore diverse target styles from a single target patient with Random Adaptive Instance Normalization (RAIN). Then, a segmentation network is trained in a supervised manner with the generated target images. Our experiments demonstrate that FUDA improves the segmentation performance by 0.33 of Dice score on the target domain compared with the baseline, and it also gives 0.28 of Dice score improvement in a more rigorous one-shot setting.

### 67.A deep Q-learning method for optimizing visual search strategies in backgrounds of dynamic noise  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12385.pdf)
>  Humans process visual information with varying resolution (foveated visual system) and explore images by orienting through eye movements the high-resolution fovea to points of interest. The Bayesian ideal searcher (IS) that employs complete knowledge of task-relevant information optimizes eye movement strategy and achieves the optimal search performance. The IS can be employed as an important tool to evaluate the optimality of human eye movements, and potentially provide guidance to improve human observer visual search strategies. Najemnik and Geisler (2005) derived an IS for backgrounds of spatial 1/f noise. The corresponding template responses follow Gaussian distributions and the optimal search strategy can be analytically determined. However, the computation of the IS can be intractable when considering more realistic and complex backgrounds such as medical images. Modern reinforcement learning methods, successfully applied to obtain optimal policy for a variety of tasks, do not require complete knowledge of the background generating functions and can be potentially applied to anatomical backgrounds. An important first step is to validate the optimality of the reinforcement learning method. In this study, we investigate the ability of a reinforcement learning method that employs Q-network to approximate the IS. We demonstrate that the search strategy corresponding to the Q-network is consistent with the IS search strategy. The findings show the potential of the reinforcement learning with Q-network approach to estimate optimal eye movement planning with real anatomical backgrounds.      
### 68.Developing a Machine-Learning Algorithm to Diagnose Age-Related Macular Degeneration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12384.pdf)
>  Today, more than 12 million people over the age of 40 suffer from ocular diseases. Most commonly, older patients are susceptible to age related macular degeneration, an eye disease that causes blurring of the central vision due to the deterioration of the retina. The former can only be detected through complex and expensive imaging software, markedly a visual field test; this leaves a significant population with untreated eye disease and holds them at risk for complete vision loss. The use of machine learning algorithms has been proposed for treating eye disease. However, the development of these models is limited by a lack of understanding regarding appropriate model and training parameters to maximize model performance. In our study, we address these points by generating 6 models, each with a learning rate of 1 * 10^n where n is 0, -1, -2, ... -6, and calculated a f1 score for each of the models. Our analysis shows that sample imbalance is a key challenge in training of machine learning models and can result in deceptive improvements in training cost which does not translate to true improvements in model predictive performance. Considering the wide ranging impact of the disease and its adverse effects, we developed a machine learning algorithm to treat the same. We trained our model on varying eye disease datasets consisting of over 5000 patients, and the pictures of their infected eyes. In the future, we hope this model is used extensively, especially in areas that are under-resourced, to better diagnose eye disease and improve well being for humanity.      
### 69.DiriNet: A network to estimate the spatial and spectral degradation functions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12346.pdf)
>  The spatial and spectral degradation functions are critical to hyper- and multi-spectral image fusion. However, few work has been payed on the estimation of the degradation functions. To learn the spatial response function and the point spread function from the image pairs to be fused, we propose a Dirichlet network, where both functions are properly constrained. Specifically, the spatial response function is constrained with positivity, while the Dirichlet distribution along with a total variation is imposed on the point spread function. To the best of our knowledge, the neural netwrok and the Dirichlet regularization are exclusively investigated, for the first time, to estimate the degradation functions. Both image degradation and fusion experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed Dirichlet network.      
### 70.Accelerating Laue Depth Reconstruction Algorithm with CUDA  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13309.pdf)
>  The Laue diffraction microscopy experiment uses the polychromatic Laue micro-diffraction technique to examine the structure of materials with sub-micron spatial resolution in all three dimensions. During this experiment, local crystallographic orientations, orientation gradients and strains are measured as properties which will be recorded in HDF5 image format. The recorded images will be processed with a depth reconstruction algorithm for future data analysis. But the current depth reconstruction algorithm consumes considerable processing time and might take up to 2 weeks for reconstructing data collected from one single experiment. To improve the depth reconstruction computation speed, we propose a scalable GPU program solution on the depth reconstruction problem in this paper. The test result shows that the running time would be 10 to 20 times faster than the prior CPU design for various size of input data.      
### 71.Proximal denoiser for convergent plug-and-play optimization with nonconvex regularization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13256.pdf)
>  Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods solve ill-posed inverse problems through iterative proximal algorithms by replacing a proximal operator by a denoising operation. When applied with deep neural network denoisers, these methods have shown state-of-the-art visual performance for image restoration problems. However, their theoretical convergence analysis is still incomplete. Most of the existing convergence results consider nonexpansive denoisers, which is non-realistic, or limit their analysis to strongly convex data-fidelity terms in the inverse problem to solve. Recently, it was proposed to train the denoiser as a gradient descent step on a functional parameterized by a deep neural network. Using such a denoiser guarantees the convergence of the PnP version of the Half-Quadratic-Splitting (PnP-HQS) iterative algorithm. In this paper, we show that this gradient denoiser can actually correspond to the proximal operator of another scalar function. Given this new result, we exploit the convergence theory of proximal algorithms in the nonconvex setting to obtain convergence results for PnP-PGD (Proximal Gradient Descent) and PnP-ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers). When built on top of a smooth gradient denoiser, we show that PnP-PGD and PnP-ADMM are convergent and target stationary points of an explicit functional. These convergence results are confirmed with numerical experiments on deblurring, super-resolution and inpainting.      
### 72.Differentiable Neural Radiosity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13190.pdf)
>  We introduce Differentiable Neural Radiosity, a novel method of representing the solution of the differential rendering equation using a neural network. Inspired by neural radiosity techniques, we minimize the norm of the residual of the differential rendering equation to directly optimize our network. The network is capable of outputting continuous, view-independent gradients of the radiance field with respect to scene parameters, taking into account differential global illumination effects while keeping memory and time complexity constant in path length. To solve inverse rendering problems, we use a pre-trained instance of our network that represents the differential radiance field with respect to a limited number of scene parameters. In our experiments, we leverage this to achieve faster and more accurate convergence compared to other techniques such as Automatic Differentiation, Radiative Backpropagation, and Path Replay Backpropagation.      
### 73.Compositionality as Lexical Symmetry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12926.pdf)
>  Standard deep network models lack the inductive biases needed to generalize compositionally in tasks like semantic parsing, translation, and question answering. A large body of work in natural language processing seeks to overcome this limitation with new model architectures that enforce a compositional process of sentence interpretation. In this paper, we present a domain-general framework for compositional modeling that instead formulates compositionality as a constraint on data distributions. We prove that for any task factorizable into a lexicon and a composition function, there exists a family of data transformation functions that are guaranteed to produce new, well-formed examples when applied to training data. We further show that it is possible to identify these data transformations even when the composition function is unknown (e.g. when we do not know how to write or infer a symbolic grammar). Using these transformation functions to perform data augmentation for ordinary RNN and transformer sequence models, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the CLEVR-CoGenT visual question answering dataset, and results comparable to specialized model architectures on the COGS semantic parsing dataset.      
### 74.Sparse Centroid-Encoder: A Nonlinear Model for Feature Selection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12910.pdf)
>  We develop a sparse optimization problem for the determination of the total set of features that discriminate two or more classes. This is a sparse implementation of the centroid-encoder for nonlinear data reduction and visualization called Sparse Centroid-Encoder (SCE). We also provide a feature selection framework that first ranks each feature by its occurrence, and the optimal number of features is chosen using a validation set. The algorithm is applied to a wide variety of data sets including, single-cell biological data, high dimensional infectious disease data, hyperspectral data, image data, and speech data. We compared our method to various state-of-the-art feature selection techniques, including two neural network-based models (DFS, and LassoNet), Sparse SVM, and Random Forest. We empirically showed that SCE features produced better classification accuracy on the unseen test data, often with fewer features.      
### 75.COIN++: Data Agnostic Neural Compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12904.pdf)
>  Neural compression algorithms are typically based on autoencoders that require specialized encoder and decoder architectures for different data modalities. In this paper, we propose COIN++, a neural compression framework that seamlessly handles a wide range of data modalities. Our approach is based on converting data to implicit neural representations, i.e. neural functions that map coordinates (such as pixel locations) to features (such as RGB values). Then, instead of storing the weights of the implicit neural representation directly, we store modulations applied to a meta-learned base network as a compressed code for the data. We further quantize and entropy code these modulations, leading to large compression gains while reducing encoding time by two orders of magnitude compared to baselines. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by compressing various data modalities, from images to medical and climate data.      
### 76.Augmenting Novelty Search with a Surrogate Model to Engineer Meta-Diversity in Ensembles of Classifiers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12896.pdf)
>  Using Neuroevolution combined with Novelty Search to promote behavioural diversity is capable of constructing high-performing ensembles for classification. However, using gradient descent to train evolved architectures during the search can be computationally prohibitive. Here we propose a method to overcome this limitation by using a surrogate model which estimates the behavioural distance between two neural network architectures required to calculate the sparseness term in Novelty Search. We demonstrate a speedup of 10 times over previous work and significantly improve on previous reported results on three benchmark datasets from Computer Vision -- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. This results from the expanded architecture search space facilitated by using a surrogate. Our method represents an improved paradigm for implementing horizontal scaling of learning algorithms by making an explicit search for diversity considerably more tractable for the same bounded resources.      
### 77.Similarity and Generalization: From Noise to Corruption  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12803.pdf)
>  Contrastive learning aims to extract distinctive features from data by finding an embedding representation where similar samples are close to each other, and different ones are far apart. We study generalization in contrastive learning, focusing on its simplest representative: Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs). We show that Double Descent also appears in SNNs and is exacerbated by noise. We point out that SNNs can be affected by two distinct sources of noise: Pair Label Noise (PLN) and Single Label Noise (SLN). The effect of SLN is asymmetric, but it preserves similarity relations, while PLN is symmetric but breaks transitivity. We show that the dataset topology crucially affects generalization. While sparse datasets show the same performances under SLN and PLN for an equal amount of noise, SLN outperforms PLN in the overparametrized region in dense datasets. Indeed, in this regime, PLN similarity violation becomes macroscopical, corrupting the dataset to the point where complete overfitting cannot be achieved. We call this phenomenon Density-Induced Break of Similarity (DIBS). We also probe the equivalence between online optimization and offline generalization for similarity tasks. We observe that an online/offline correspondence in similarity learning can be affected by both the network architecture and label noise.      
### 78.TransBTSV2: Wider Instead of Deeper Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12785.pdf)
>  Transformer, benefiting from global (long-range) information modeling using self-attention mechanism, has been successful in natural language processing and computer vision recently. Convolutional Neural Networks, capable of capturing local features, are unable to model explicit long-distance dependencies from global feature space. However, both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we exploit Transformer in 3D CNN for 3D medical image volumetric segmentation and propose a novel network named TransBTSV2 based on the encoder-decoder structure. Different from our original TransBTS, the proposed TransBTSV2 is not limited to brain tumor segmentation (BTS) but focuses on general medical image segmentation, providing a strong and efficient 3D baseline for volumetric segmentation of medical images. As a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, TransBTSV2 can achieve accurate segmentation of medical images without any pre-training. With the proposed insight to redesign the internal structure of Transformer and the introduced Deformable Bottleneck Module, a highly efficient architecture is achieved with superior performance. Extensive experimental results on four medical image datasets (BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020, LiTS 2017 and KiTS 2019) demonstrate that TransBTSV2 achieves comparable or better results as compared to the state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumor, liver tumor as well as kidney tumor.

### 80.You Only Demonstrate Once: Category-Level Manipulation from Single Visual Demonstration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12716.pdf)
>  Promising results have been achieved recently in category-level manipulation that generalizes across object instances. Nevertheless, it often requires expensive real-world data collection and manual specification of semantic keypoints for each object category and task. Additionally, coarse keypoint predictions and ignoring intermediate action sequences hinder adoption in complex manipulation tasks beyond pick-and-place. This work proposes a novel, category-level manipulation framework that leverages an object-centric, category-level representation and model-free 6 DoF motion tracking. The canonical object representation is learned solely in simulation and then used to parse a category-level, task trajectory from a single demonstration video. The demonstration is reprojected to a target trajectory tailored to a novel object via the canonical representation. During execution, the manipulation horizon is decomposed into long-range, collision-free motion and last-inch manipulation. For the latter part, a category-level behavior cloning (CatBC) method leverages motion tracking to perform closed-loop control. CatBC follows the target trajectory, projected from the demonstration and anchored to a dynamically selected category-level coordinate frame. The frame is automatically selected along the manipulation horizon by a local attention mechanism. This framework allows to teach different manipulation strategies by solely providing a single demonstration, without complicated manual programming. Extensive experiments demonstrate its efficacy in a range of challenging industrial tasks in high-precision assembly, which involve learning complex, long-horizon policies. The process exhibits robustness against uncertainty due to dynamics as well as generalization across object instances and scene configurations.      
### 81.Deep Contrastive Learning is Provably (almost) Principal Component Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12680.pdf)
>  We show that Contrastive Learning (CL) under a family of loss functions (including InfoNCE) has a game-theoretical formulation, where the \emph{max player} finds representation to maximize contrastiveness, and the \emph{min player} puts weights on pairs of samples with similar representation. We show that the max player who does \emph{representation learning} reduces to Principal Component Analysis for deep linear network, and almost all local minima are global, recovering optimal PCA solutions. Experiments show that the formulation yields comparable (or better) performance on CIFAR10 and STL-10 when extending beyond InfoNCE, yielding novel contrastive losses. Furthermore, we extend our theoretical analysis to 2-layer ReLU networks, showing its difference from linear ones, and proving that feature composition is preferred over picking single dominant feature under strong augmentation.      
### 82.A Stochastic Bundle Method for Interpolating Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12678.pdf)
>  We propose a novel method for training deep neural networks that are capable of interpolation, that is, driving the empirical loss to zero. At each iteration, our method constructs a stochastic approximation of the learning objective. The approximation, known as a bundle, is a pointwise maximum of linear functions. Our bundle contains a constant function that lower bounds the empirical loss. This enables us to compute an automatic adaptive learning rate, thereby providing an accurate solution. In addition, our bundle includes linear approximations computed at the current iterate and other linear estimates of the DNN parameters. The use of these additional approximations makes our method significantly more robust to its hyperparameters. Based on its desirable empirical properties, we term our method Bundle Optimisation for Robust and Accurate Training (BORAT). In order to operationalise BORAT, we design a novel algorithm for optimising the bundle approximation efficiently at each iteration. We establish the theoretical convergence of BORAT in both convex and non-convex settings. Using standard publicly available data sets, we provide a thorough comparison of BORAT to other single hyperparameter optimisation algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate BORAT matches the state-of-the-art generalisation performance for these methods and is the most robust.      
### 83.Learning Fast, Learning Slow: A General Continual Learning Method based on Complementary Learning System  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12604.pdf)
>  Humans excel at continually learning from an ever-changing environment whereas it remains a challenge for deep neural networks which exhibit catastrophic forgetting. The complementary learning system (CLS) theory suggests that the interplay between rapid instance-based learning and slow structured learning in the brain is crucial for accumulating and retaining knowledge. Here, we propose CLS-ER, a novel dual memory experience replay (ER) method which maintains short-term and long-term semantic memories that interact with the episodic memory. Our method employs an effective replay mechanism whereby new knowledge is acquired while aligning the decision boundaries with the semantic memories. CLS-ER does not utilize the task boundaries or make any assumption about the distribution of the data which makes it versatile and suited for "general continual learning". Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks as well as more realistic general continual learning settings.      
### 84.FedMed-ATL: Misaligned Unpaired Brain Image Synthesis via Affine Transform Loss  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12589.pdf)
>  The existence of completely aligned and paired multi-modal neuroimaging data has proved its effectiveness in the diagnosis of brain diseases. However, collecting the full set of well-aligned and paired data is impractical or even luxurious, since the practical difficulties may include high cost, long time acquisition, image corruption, and privacy issues. Previously, the misaligned unpaired neuroimaging data (termed as MUD) are generally treated as noisy label. However, such a noisy label-based method could not work very well when misaligned data occurs distortions severely, for example, different angles of rotation. In this paper, we propose a novel federated self-supervised learning (FedMed) for brain image synthesis. An affine transform loss (ATL) was formulated to make use of severely distorted images without violating privacy legislation for the hospital. We then introduce a new data augmentation procedure for self-supervised training and fed it into three auxiliary heads, namely auxiliary rotation, auxiliary translation, and auxiliary scaling heads. The proposed method demonstrates advanced performance in both the quality of synthesized results under a severely misaligned and unpaired data setting, and better stability than other GAN-based algorithms. The proposed method also reduces the demand for deformable registration while encouraging to realize the usage of those misaligned and unpaired data. Experimental results verify the outstanding ability of our learning paradigm compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

### 85.A Novel Matrix-Encoding Method for Privacy-Preserving Neural Networks (Inference)  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12577.pdf)
>  In this work, we present $\texttt{Volley Revolver}$, a novel matrix-encoding method that is particularly convenient for privacy-preserving neural networks to make predictions, and use it to implement a CNN for handwritten image classification. Based on this encoding method, we develop several additional operations for putting into practice the secure matrix multiplication over encrypted data matrices. For two matrices $A$ and $B$ to perform multiplication $A \times B$, the main idea is, in a simple version, to encrypt matrix $A$ and the transposition of the matrix $B$ into two ciphertexts respectively. Along with the additional operations, the homomorphic matrix multiplication $A \times B$ can be calculated over encrypted data matrices efficiently. For the convolution operation in CNN, on the basis of the $\texttt{Volley Revolver}$ encoding method, we develop a feasible and efficient evaluation strategy for performing the convolution operation. We in advance span each convolution kernel of CNN to a matrix space of the same size as the input image so as to generate several ciphertexts, each of which is later used together with the input image for calculating some part of the final convolution result. We accumulate all these part results of convolution operation and thus obtain the final convolution result.      
### 86.Syfer: Neural Obfuscation for Private Data Release  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12406.pdf)
>  Balancing privacy and predictive utility remains a central challenge for machine learning in healthcare. In this paper, we develop Syfer, a neural obfuscation method to protect against re-identification attacks. Syfer composes trained layers with random neural networks to encode the original data (e.g. X-rays) while maintaining the ability to predict diagnoses from the encoded data. The randomness in the encoder acts as the private key for the data owner. We quantify privacy as the number of attacker guesses required to re-identify a single image (guesswork). We propose a contrastive learning algorithm to estimate guesswork. We show empirically that differentially private methods, such as DP-Image, obtain privacy at a significant loss of utility. In contrast, Syfer achieves strong privacy while preserving utility. For example, X-ray classifiers built with DP-image, Syfer, and original data achieve average AUCs of 0.53, 0.78, and 0.86, respectively.      
### 87.DoubleU-Net++: Architecture with Exploit Multiscale Features for Vertebrae Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12389.pdf)
>  Accurate segmentation of the vertebra is an important prerequisite in various medical applications (E.g. tele surgery) to assist surgeons. Following the successful development of deep neural networks, recent studies have focused on the essential rule of vertebral segmentation. Prior works contain a large number of parameters, and their segmentation is restricted to only one view. Inspired by DoubleU-Net, we propose a novel model named DoubleU-Net++ in which DensNet as feature extractor, special attention module from Convolutional Block Attention on Module (CBAM) and, Pyramid Squeeze Attention (PSA) module are employed to improve extracted features. We evaluate our proposed model on three different views (sagittal, coronal, and axial) of VerSe2020 and xVertSeg datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art studies, our architecture is trained faster and achieves higher precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation (imporoved by 4-6%) and the result of above 94% for sagittal view and above 94% for both coronal view and above 93% axial view were gained for VerSe2020 dataset, respectively. Also, for xVertSeg dataset, we achieved precision, recall,and F1-score of above 97% for sagittal view, above 93% for coronal view ,and above 96% for axial view.      
### 88.Deep Learning Methods for Abstract Visual Reasoning: A Survey on Raven's Progressive Matrices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12382.pdf)
>  Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) domain encompasses problems solving which requires the ability to reason about relations among entities present in a given scene. While humans, generally, solve AVR tasks in a ``natural'' way, even without prior experience, this type of problems has proven difficult for current machine learning systems. The paper summarises recent progress in applying deep learning methods to solving AVR problems, as a proxy for studying machine intelligence. We focus on the most common type of AVR tasks -- the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs) -- and provide a comprehensive review of the learning methods and deep neural models applied to solve RPMs, as well as, the RPM benchmark sets. Performance analysis of the state-of-the-art approaches to solving RPMs leads to formulation of certain insights and remarks on the current and future trends in this area. We conclude the paper by demonstrating how real-world problems can benefit from the discoveries of RPM studies.      
### 89.Low-rank features based double transformation matrices learning for image classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12351.pdf)
>  Linear regression is a supervised method that has been widely used in classification tasks. In order to apply linear regression to classification tasks, a technique for relaxing regression targets was proposed. However, methods based on this technique ignore the pressure on a single transformation matrix due to the complex information contained in the data. A single transformation matrix in this case is too strict to provide a flexible projection, thus it is necessary to adopt relaxation on transformation matrix. This paper proposes a double transformation matrices learning method based on latent low-rank feature extraction. The core idea is to use double transformation matrices for relaxation, and jointly projecting the learned principal and salient features from two directions into the label space, which can share the pressure of a single transformation matrix. Firstly, the low-rank features are learned by the latent low rank representation (LatLRR) method which processes the original data from two directions. In this process, sparse noise is also separated, which alleviates its interference on projection learning to some extent. Then, two transformation matrices are introduced to process the two features separately, and the information useful for the classification is extracted. Finally, the two transformation matrices can be easily obtained by alternate optimization methods. Through such processing, even when a large amount of redundant information is contained in samples, our method can also obtain projection results that are easy to classify. Experiments on multiple data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for classification, especially for complex scenarios.      
### 90.Dual Learning Music Composition and Dance Choreography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11999.pdf)
>  Music and dance have always co-existed as pillars of human activities, contributing immensely to the cultural, social, and entertainment functions in virtually all societies. Notwithstanding the gradual systematization of music and dance into two independent disciplines, their intimate connection is undeniable and one art-form often appears incomplete without the other. Recent research works have studied generative models for dance sequences conditioned on music. The dual task of composing music for given dances, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel extension, where we jointly model both tasks in a dual learning approach. To leverage the duality of the two modalities, we introduce an optimal transport objective to align feature embeddings, as well as a cycle consistency loss to foster overall consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our dual learning framework improves individual task performance, delivering generated music compositions and dance choreographs that are realistic and faithful to the conditioned inputs.
