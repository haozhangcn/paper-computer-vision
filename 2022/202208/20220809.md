### 1.3D Vision with Transformers: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04309.pdf)
>  The success of the transformer architecture in natural language processing has recently triggered attention in the computer vision field. The transformer has been used as a replacement for the widely used convolution operators, due to its ability to learn long-range dependencies. This replacement was proven to be successful in numerous tasks, in which several state-of-the-art methods rely on transformers for better learning. In computer vision, the 3D field has also witnessed an increase in employing the transformer for 3D convolution neural networks and multi-layer perceptron networks. Although a number of surveys have focused on transformers in vision in general, 3D vision requires special attention due to the difference in data representation and processing when compared to 2D vision. In this work, we present a systematic and thorough review of more than 100 transformers methods for different 3D vision tasks, including classification, segmentation, detection, completion, pose estimation, and others. We discuss transformer design in 3D vision, which allows it to process data with various 3D representations. For each application, we highlight key properties and contributions of proposed transformer-based methods. To assess the competitiveness of these methods, we compare their performance to common non-transformer methods on 12 3D benchmarks. We conclude the survey by discussing different open directions and challenges for transformers in 3D vision. In addition to the presented papers, we aim to frequently update the latest relevant papers along with their corresponding implementations at: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/lahoud/3d-vision-transformers" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 2.PlaneFormers: From Sparse View Planes to 3D Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04307.pdf)
>  We present an approach for the planar surface reconstruction of a scene from images with limited overlap. This reconstruction task is challenging since it requires jointly reasoning about single image 3D reconstruction, correspondence between images, and the relative camera pose between images. Past work has proposed optimization-based approaches. We introduce a simpler approach, the PlaneFormer, that uses a transformer applied to 3D-aware plane tokens to perform 3D reasoning. Our experiments show that our approach is substantially more effective than prior work, and that several 3D-specific design decisions are crucial for its success.      
### 3.Gaze Estimation Approach Using Deep Differential Residual Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04298.pdf)
>  Gaze estimation, which is a method to determine where a person is looking at given the person's full face, is a valuable clue for understanding human intention. Similarly to other domains of computer vision, deep learning (DL) methods have gained recognition in the gaze estimation domain. However, there are still gaze calibration problems in the gaze estimation domain, thus preventing existing methods from further improving the performances. An effective solution is to directly predict the difference information of two human eyes, such as the differential network (Diff-Nn). However, this solution results in a loss of accuracy when using only one inference image. We propose a differential residual model (DRNet) combined with a new loss function to make use of the difference information of two eye images. We treat the difference information as auxiliary information. We assess the proposed model (DRNet) mainly using two public datasets (1) MpiiGaze and (2) Eyediap. Considering only the eye features, DRNet outperforms the state-of-the-art gaze estimation methods with $angular-error$ of 4.57 and 6.14 using MpiiGaze and Eyediap datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the experimental results also demonstrate that DRNet is extremely robust to noise images.      
### 4.Exploiting Shape Cues for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04286.pdf)
>  Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims to produce pixel-wise class predictions with only image-level labels for training. To this end, previous methods adopt the common pipeline: they generate pseudo masks from class activation maps (CAMs) and use such masks to supervise segmentation networks. However, it is challenging to derive comprehensive pseudo masks that cover the whole extent of objects due to the local property of CAMs, i.e., they tend to focus solely on small discriminative object parts. In this paper, we associate the locality of CAMs with the texture-biased property of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Accordingly, we propose to exploit shape information to supplement the texture-biased CNN features, thereby encouraging mask predictions to be not only comprehensive but also well-aligned with object boundaries. We further refine the predictions in an online fashion with a novel refinement method that takes into account both the class and the color affinities, in order to generate reliable pseudo masks to supervise the model. Importantly, our model is end-to-end trained within a single-stage framework and therefore efficient in terms of the training cost. Through extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, we validate the effectiveness of our method in producing precise and shape-aligned segmentation results. Specifically, our model surpasses the existing state-of-the-art single-stage approaches by large margins. What is more, it also achieves a new state-of-the-art performance over multi-stage approaches, when adopted in a simple two-stage pipeline without bells and whistles.      
### 5.LWGNet: Learned Wirtinger Gradients for Fourier Ptychographic Phase Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04283.pdf)
>  Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) is an imaging procedure that overcomes the traditional limit on Space-Bandwidth Product (SBP) of conventional microscopes through computational means. It utilizes multiple images captured using a low numerical aperture (NA) objective and enables high-resolution phase imaging through frequency domain stitching. Existing FPM reconstruction methods can be broadly categorized into two approaches: iterative optimization based methods, which are based on the physics of the forward imaging model, and data-driven methods which commonly employ a feed-forward deep learning framework. We propose a hybrid model-driven residual network that combines the knowledge of the forward imaging system with a deep data-driven network. Our proposed architecture, LWGNet, unrolls traditional Wirtinger flow optimization algorithm into a novel neural network design that enhances the gradient images through complex convolutional blocks. Unlike other conventional unrolling techniques, LWGNet uses fewer stages while performing at par or even better than existing traditional and deep learning techniques, particularly, for low-cost and low dynamic range CMOS sensors. This improvement in performance for low-bit depth and low-cost sensors has the potential to bring down the cost of FPM imaging setup significantly. Finally, we show consistently improved performance on our collected real data.      
### 6.Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning for 3D Mesh Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04278.pdf)
>  3D deep learning is a growing field of interest due to the vast amount of information stored in 3D formats. Triangular meshes are an efficient representation for irregular, non-uniform 3D objects. However, meshes are often challenging to annotate due to their high geometrical complexity. Specifically, creating segmentation masks for meshes is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, it is desirable to train segmentation networks with limited-labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL), a form of unsupervised representation learning, is a growing alternative to fully-supervised learning which can decrease the burden of supervision for training. We propose SSL-MeshCNN, a self-supervised contrastive learning method for pre-training CNNs for mesh segmentation. We take inspiration from traditional contrastive learning frameworks to design a novel contrastive learning algorithm specifically for meshes. Our preliminary experiments show promising results in reducing the heavy labeled data requirement needed for mesh segmentation by at least 33%.      
### 7.Label-Free Synthetic Pretraining of Object Detectors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04268.pdf)
>  We propose a new approach, Synthetic Optimized Layout with Instance Detection (SOLID), to pretrain object detectors with synthetic images. Our "SOLID" approach consists of two main components: (1) generating synthetic images using a collection of unlabelled 3D models with optimized scene arrangement; (2) pretraining an object detector on "instance detection" task - given a query image depicting an object, detecting all instances of the exact same object in a target image. Our approach does not need any semantic labels for pretraining and allows the use of arbitrary, diverse 3D models. Experiments on COCO show that with optimized data generation and a proper pretraining task, synthetic data can be highly effective data for pretraining object detectors. In particular, pretraining on rendered images achieves performance competitive with pretraining on real images while using significantly less computing resources.

### 8.Distincive Image Captioning via CLIP Guided Group Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04254.pdf)
>  Image captioning models are usually trained according to human annotated ground-truth captions, which could generate accurate but generic captions. To improve the distinctiveness of captioning models, we firstly propose a series of metrics that use large-scale vision-language pre-training model CLIP to evaluate the distinctiveness of captions. Then we propose a simple and effective training strategy which trains the model by comparison within similar image groups. We conduct extensive experiments on various existing models to demonstrate the wide applicability of our strategy and the consistency of metric based results with human evaluation. By comparing the performance of our best model with existing state-of-the-art models, we claim that our model achieves new state-of-the-art towards distinctiveness objective.      
### 9.Snowpack Estimation in Key Mountainous Water Basins from Openly-Available, Multimodal Data Sources  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04246.pdf)
>  Accurately estimating the snowpack in key mountainous basins is critical for water resource managers to make decisions that impact local and global economies, wildlife, and public policy. Currently, this estimation requires multiple LiDAR-equipped plane flights or in situ measurements, both of which are expensive, sparse, and biased towards accessible regions. In this paper, we demonstrate that fusing spatial and temporal information from multiple, openly-available satellite and weather data sources enables estimation of snowpack in key mountainous regions. Our multisource model outperforms single-source estimation by 5.0 inches RMSE, as well as outperforms sparse in situ measurements by 1.2 inches RMSE.      
### 10.SKDCGN: Source-free Knowledge Distillation of Counterfactual Generative Networks using cGANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04226.pdf)
>  With the usage of appropriate inductive biases, Counterfactual Generative Networks (CGNs) can generate novel images from random combinations of shape, texture, and background manifolds. These images can be utilized to train an invariant classifier, avoiding the wide spread problem of deep architectures learning spurious correlations rather than meaningful ones. As a consequence, out-of-domain robustness is improved. However, the CGN architecture comprises multiple over parameterized networks, namely BigGAN and U2-Net. Training these networks requires appropriate background knowledge and extensive computation. Since one does not always have access to the precise training details, nor do they always possess the necessary knowledge of counterfactuals, our work addresses the following question: Can we use the knowledge embedded in pre-trained CGNs to train a lower-capacity model, assuming black-box access (i.e., only access to the pretrained CGN model) to the components of the architecture? In this direction, we propose a novel work named SKDCGN that attempts knowledge transfer using Knowledge Distillation (KD). In our proposed architecture, each independent mechanism (shape, texture, background) is represented by a student 'TinyGAN' that learns from the pretrained teacher 'BigGAN'. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method using state-of-the-art datasets such as ImageNet, and MNIST by using KD and appropriate loss functions. Moreover, as an additional contribution, our paper conducts a thorough study on the composition mechanism of the CGNs, to gain a better understanding of how each mechanism influences the classification accuracy of an invariant classifier.

### 11.Boosting Video-Text Retrieval with Explicit High-Level Semantics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04215.pdf)
>  Video-text retrieval (VTR) is an attractive yet challenging task for multi-modal understanding, which aims to search for relevant video (text) given a query (video). Existing methods typically employ completely heterogeneous visual-textual information to align video and text, whilst lacking the awareness of homogeneous high-level semantic information residing in both modalities. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a novel visual-linguistic aligning model named HiSE for VTR, which improves the cross-modal representation by incorporating explicit high-level semantics. First, we explore the hierarchical property of explicit high-level semantics, and further decompose it into two levels, i.e. discrete semantics and holistic semantics. Specifically, for visual branch, we exploit an off-the-shelf semantic entity predictor to generate discrete high-level semantics. In parallel, a trained video captioning model is employed to output holistic high-level semantics. As for the textual modality, we parse the text into three parts including occurrence, action and entity. In particular, the occurrence corresponds to the holistic high-level semantics, meanwhile both action and entity represent the discrete ones. Then, different graph reasoning techniques are utilized to promote the interaction between holistic and discrete high-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with the aid of explicit high-level semantics, our method achieves the superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD and DiDeMo.      
### 12.Vision-Based Activity Recognition in Children with Autism-Related Behaviors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04206.pdf)
>  Advances in machine learning and contactless sensors have enabled the understanding complex human behaviors in a healthcare setting. In particular, several deep learning systems have been introduced to enable comprehensive analysis of neuro-developmental conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This condition affects children from their early developmental stages onwards, and diagnosis relies entirely on observing the child's behavior and detecting behavioral cues. However, the diagnosis process is time-consuming as it requires long-term behavior observation, and the scarce availability of specialists. We demonstrate the effect of a region-based computer vision system to help clinicians and parents analyze a child's behavior. For this purpose, we adopt and enhance a dataset for analyzing autism-related actions using videos of children captured in uncontrolled environments (e.g. videos collected with consumer-grade cameras, in varied environments). The data is pre-processed by detecting the target child in the video to reduce the impact of background noise. Motivated by the effectiveness of temporal convolutional models, we propose both light-weight and conventional models capable of extracting action features from video frames and classifying autism-related behaviors by analyzing the relationships between frames in a video. Through extensive evaluations on the feature extraction and learning strategies, we demonstrate that the best performance is achieved with an Inflated 3D Convnet and Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Networks, achieving a 0.83 Weighted F1-score for classification of the three autism-related actions, outperforming existing methods. We also propose a light-weight solution by employing the ESNet backbone within the same system, achieving competitive results of 0.71 Weighted F1-score, and enabling potential deployment on embedded systems.      
### 13.Analog Bits: Generating Discrete Data using Diffusion Models with Self-Conditioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04202.pdf)
>  We present Bit Diffusion: a simple and generic approach for generating discrete data with continuous diffusion models. The main idea behind our approach is to first represent the discrete data as binary bits, and then train a continuous diffusion model to model these bits as real numbers which we call analog bits. To generate samples, the model first generates the analog bits, which are then thresholded to obtain the bits that represent the discrete variables. We further propose two simple techniques, namely Self-Conditioning and Asymmetric Time Intervals, which lead to a significant improvement in sample quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can achieve strong performance in both discrete image generation and image captioning tasks. For discrete image generation, we significantly improve previous state-of-the-art on both CIFAR-10 (which has 3K discrete 8-bit tokens) and ImageNet-64x64 (which has 12K discrete 8-bit tokens), outperforming the best autoregressive model in both sample quality (measured by FID) and efficiency. For image captioning on MS-COCO dataset, our approach achieves competitive results compared to autoregressive models.      
### 14.SA-NET.v2: Real-time vehicle detection from oblique UAV images with use of uncertainty estimation in deep meta-learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04190.pdf)
>  In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging is a suitable solution for real-time monitoring different vehicles on the urban scale. Real-time vehicle detection with the use of uncertainty estimation in deep meta-learning for the portable platforms (e.g., UAV) potentially improves video understanding in real-world applications with a small training dataset, while many vehicle monitoring approaches appear to understand single-time detection with a big training dataset. The purpose of real-time vehicle detection from oblique UAV images is to locate the vehicle on the time series UAV images by using semantic segmentation. Real-time vehicle detection is more difficult due to the variety of depth and scale vehicles in oblique view UAV images. Motivated by these facts, in this manuscript, we consider the problem of real-time vehicle detection for oblique UAV images based on a small training dataset and deep meta-learning. The proposed architecture, called SA-Net.v2, is a developed method based on the SA-CNN for real-time vehicle detection by reformulating the squeeze-and-attention mechanism. The SA-Net.v2 is composed of two components, including the squeeze-and-attention function that extracts the high-level feature based on a small training dataset, and the gated CNN. For the real-time vehicle detection scenario, we test our model on the UAVid dataset. UAVid is a time series oblique UAV images dataset consisting of 30 video sequences. We examine the proposed method's applicability for stand real-time vehicle detection in urban environments using time series UAV images. The experiments show that the SA-Net.v2 achieves promising performance in time series oblique UAV images.      
### 15.SsaA: A Self-supervised auto-Annotation System for Online Visual Inspection and Manufacturing Automation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04173.pdf)
>  Recent trends in cloud computing technology effectively boosted the application of visual inspection. However, most of the available systems work in a human-in-the-loop manner and can not provide long-term support to the online application. To make a step forward, this paper outlines an automatic annotation system called SsaA, working in a self-supervised learning manner, for continuously making the online visual inspection in the manufacturing automation scenarios. Benefit from the self-supervised learning, SsaA is effective to establish a visual inspection application for the whole life-cycle of manufacturing. In the early stage, with only the anomaly-free data, the unsupervised algorithms are adopted to process the pretext task and generate coarse labels for the following data. Then supervised algorithms are trained for the downstream task. With user-friendly web-based interfaces, SsaA is very convenient to integrate and deploy both of the unsupervised and supervised algorithms. So far, the SsaA system has been adopted for some real-life industrial applications.      
### 16.Neural Message Passing for Visual Relationship Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04165.pdf)
>  Visual relationship detection aims to detect the interactions between objects in an image; however, this task suffers from combinatorial explosion due to the variety of objects and interactions. Since the interactions associated with the same object are dependent, we explore the dependency of interactions to reduce the search space. We explicitly model objects and interactions by an interaction graph and then propose a message-passing-style algorithm to propagate the contextual information. We thus call the proposed method neural message passing (NMP). We further integrate language priors and spatial cues to rule out unrealistic interactions and capture spatial interactions. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Our code is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/PhyllisH/NMP" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 17.Understanding Masked Image Modeling via Learning Occlusion Invariant Feature  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04164.pdf)
>  Recently, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) achieves great success in self-supervised visual recognition. However, as a reconstruction-based framework, it is still an open question to understand how MIM works, since MIM appears very different from previous well-studied siamese approaches such as contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose a new viewpoint: MIM implicitly learns occlusion-invariant features, which is analogous to other siamese methods while the latter learns other invariance. By relaxing MIM formulation into an equivalent siamese form, MIM methods can be interpreted in a unified framework with conventional methods, among which only a) data transformations, i.e. what invariance to learn, and b) similarity measurements are different. Furthermore, taking MAE (He et al.) as a representative example of MIM, we empirically find the success of MIM models relates a little to the choice of similarity functions, but the learned occlusion invariant feature introduced by masked image -- it turns out to be a favored initialization for vision transformers, even though the learned feature could be less semantic. We hope our findings could inspire researchers to develop more powerful self-supervised methods in computer vision community.      
### 18.Efficient Neural Net Approaches in Metal Casting Defect Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04150.pdf)
>  One of the most pressing challenges prevalent in the steel manufacturing industry is the identification of surface defects. Early identification of casting defects can help boost performance, including streamlining production processes. Though, deep learning models have helped bridge this gap and automate most of these processes, there is a dire need to come up with lightweight models that can be deployed easily with faster inference times. This research proposes a lightweight architecture that is efficient in terms of accuracy and inference time compared with sophisticated pre-trained CNN architectures like MobileNet, Inception, and ResNet, including vision transformers. Methodologies to minimize computational requirements such as depth-wise separable convolution and global average pooling (GAP) layer, including techniques that improve architectural efficiencies and augmentations, have been experimented. Our results indicate that a custom model of 590K parameters with depth-wise separable convolutions outperformed pretrained architectures such as Resnet and Vision transformers in terms of accuracy (81.87%) and comfortably outdid architectures such as Resnet, Inception, and Vision transformers in terms of faster inference times (12 ms). Blurpool fared outperformed other techniques, with an accuracy of 83.98%. Augmentations had a paradoxical effect on the model performance. No direct correlation between depth-wise and 3x3 convolutions on inference time, they, however, they played a direct role in improving model efficiency by enabling the networks to go deeper and by decreasing the number of trainable parameters. Our work sheds light on the fact that custom networks with efficient architectures and faster inference times can be built without the need of relying on pre-trained architectures.      
### 19.DALLE-URBAN: Capturing the urban design expertise of large text to image transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04139.pdf)
>  Automatically converting text descriptions into images using transformer architectures has recently received considerable attention. Such advances have implications for many applied design disciplines across fashion, art, architecture, urban planning, landscape design and the future tools available to such disciplines. However, a detailed analysis capturing the capabilities of such models, specifically with a focus on the built environment, has not been performed to date. In this work, we investigate the capabilities and biases of such text-to-image methods as it applies to the built environment in detail. We use a systematic grammar to generate queries related to the built environment and evaluate resulting generated images. We generate 1020 different images and find that text to image transformers are robust at generating realistic images across different domains for this use-case. Generated imagery can be found at the github: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/sachith500/DALLEURBAN" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 20.Adversarial Attacks on Image Generation With Made-Up Words  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04135.pdf)
>  Text-guided image generation models can be prompted to generate images using nonce words adversarially designed to robustly evoke specific visual concepts. Two approaches for such generation are introduced: macaronic prompting, which involves designing cryptic hybrid words by concatenating subword units from different languages; and evocative prompting, which involves designing nonce words whose broad morphological features are similar enough to that of existing words to trigger robust visual associations. The two methods can also be combined to generate images associated with more specific visual concepts. The implications of these techniques for the circumvention of existing approaches to content moderation, and particularly the generation of offensive or harmful images, are discussed.      
### 21.Automatic lesion analysis for increased efficiency in outcome prediction of traumatic brain injury  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04114.pdf)
>  The accurate prognosis for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is difficult yet essential to inform therapy, patient management, and long-term after-care. Patient characteristics such as age, motor and pupil responsiveness, hypoxia and hypotension, and radiological findings on computed tomography (CT), have been identified as important variables for TBI outcome prediction. CT is the acute imaging modality of choice in clinical practice because of its acquisition speed and widespread availability. However, this modality is mainly used for qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment, such as the Marshall scoring system, which is prone to subjectivity and human errors. This work explores the predictive power of imaging biomarkers extracted from routinely-acquired hospital admission CT scans using a state-of-the-art, deep learning TBI lesion segmentation method. We use lesion volumes and corresponding lesion statistics as inputs for an extended TBI outcome prediction model. We compare the predictive power of our proposed features to the Marshall score, independently and when paired with classic TBI biomarkers. We find that automatically extracted quantitative CT features perform similarly or better than the Marshall score in predicting unfavourable TBI outcomes. Leveraging automatic atlas alignment, we also identify frontal extra-axial lesions as important indicators of poor outcome. Our work may contribute to a better understanding of TBI, and provides new insights into how automated neuroimaging analysis can be used to improve prognostication after TBI.      
### 22.Towards Semantic Communications: Deep Learning-Based Image Semantic Coding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04094.pdf)
>  Semantic communications has received growing interest since it can remarkably reduce the amount of data to be transmitted without missing critical information. Most existing works explore the semantic encoding and transmission for text and apply techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret the meaning of the text. In this paper, we conceive the semantic communications for image data that is much more richer in semantics and bandwidth sensitive. We propose an reinforcement learning based adaptive semantic coding (RL-ASC) approach that encodes images beyond pixel level. Firstly, we define the semantic concept of image data that includes the category, spatial arrangement, and visual feature as the representation unit, and propose a convolutional semantic encoder to extract semantic concepts. Secondly, we propose the image reconstruction criterion that evolves from the traditional pixel similarity to semantic similarity and perceptual performance. Thirdly, we design a novel RL-based semantic bit allocation model, whose reward is the increase in rate-semantic-perceptual performance after encoding a certain semantic concept with adaptive quantization level. Thus, the task-related information is preserved and reconstructed properly while less important data is discarded. Finally, we propose the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based semantic decoder that fuses both locally and globally features via an attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-ASC is noise robust and could reconstruct visually pleasant and semantic consistent image, and saves times of bit cost compared to standard codecs and other deep learning-based image codecs.      
### 23.Multi-Frames Temporal Abnormal Clues Learning Method for Face Anti-Spoofing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04076.pdf)
>  Face anti-spoofing researches are widely used in face recognition and has received more attention from industry and academics. In this paper, we propose the EulerNet, a new temporal feature fusion network in which the differential filter and residual pyramid are used to extract and amplify abnormal clues from continuous frames, respectively. A lightweight sample labeling method based on face landmarks is designed to label large-scale samples at a lower cost and has better results than other methods such as 3D camera. Finally, we collect 30,000 live and spoofing samples using various mobile ends to create a dataset that replicates various forms of attacks in a real-world setting. Extensive experiments on public OULU-NPU show that our algorithm is superior to the state of art and our solution has already been deployed in real-world systems servicing millions of users.      
### 24.GRIT-VLP: Grouped Mini-batch Sampling for Efficient Vision and Language Pre-training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04060.pdf)
>  Most of the currently existing vision and language pre-training (VLP) methods have mainly focused on how to extract and align vision and text features. In contrast to the mainstream VLP methods, we highlight that two routinely applied steps during pre-training have crucial impact on the performance of the pre-trained model: in-batch hard negative sampling for image-text matching (ITM) and assigning the large masking probability for the masked language modeling (MLM). After empirically showing the unexpected effectiveness of above two steps, we systematically devise our GRIT-VLP, which adaptively samples mini-batches for more effective mining of hard negative samples for ITM while maintaining the computational cost for pre-training. Our method consists of three components: 1) GRouped mIni-baTch sampling (GRIT) strategy that collects similar examples in a mini-batch, 2) ITC consistency loss for improving the mining ability, and 3) enlarged masking probability for MLM. Consequently, we show our GRIT-VLP achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks with much less computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model is essentially in par with ALBEF, the previous state-of-the-art, only with one-third of training epochs on the same training data.

### 25.Dataset of Industrial Metal Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04052.pdf)
>  We present a diverse dataset of industrial metal objects. These objects are symmetric, textureless and highly reflective, leading to challenging conditions not captured in existing datasets. Our dataset contains both real-world and synthetic multi-view RGB images with 6D object pose labels. Real-world data is obtained by recording multi-view images of scenes with varying object shapes, materials, carriers, compositions and lighting conditions. This results in over 30,000 images, accurately labelled using a new public tool. Synthetic data is obtained by carefully simulating real-world conditions and varying them in a controlled and realistic way. This leads to over 500,000 synthetic images. The close correspondence between synthetic and real-world data, and controlled variations, will facilitate sim-to-real research. Our dataset's size and challenging nature will facilitate research on various computer vision tasks involving reflective materials. The dataset and accompanying resources are made available on the project website at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://pderoovere.github.io/dimo" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 26.SLiDE: Self-supervised LiDAR De-snowing through Reconstruction Difficulty  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04043.pdf)
>  LiDAR is widely used to capture accurate 3D outdoor scene structures. However, LiDAR produces many undesirable noise points in snowy weather, which hamper analyzing meaningful 3D scene structures. Semantic segmentation with snow labels would be a straightforward solution for removing them, but it requires laborious point-wise annotation. To address this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for snow points removal in LiDAR point clouds. Our method exploits the structural characteristic of the noise points: low spatial correlation with their neighbors. Our method consists of two deep neural networks: Point Reconstruction Network (PR-Net) reconstructs each point from its neighbors; Reconstruction Difficulty Network (RD-Net) predicts point-wise difficulty of the reconstruction by PR-Net, which we call reconstruction difficulty. With simple post-processing, our method effectively detects snow points without any label. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance among label-free approaches and is comparable to the fully-supervised method. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can be exploited as a pretext task to improve label-efficiency of supervised training of de-snowing.      
### 27.Eight Years of Face Recognition Research: Reproducibility, Achievements and Open Issues  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04040.pdf)
>  Automatic face recognition is a research area with high popularity. Many different face recognition algorithms have been proposed in the last thirty years of intensive research in the field. With the popularity of deep learning and its capability to solve a huge variety of different problems, face recognition researchers have concentrated effort on creating better models under this paradigm. From the year 2015, state-of-the-art face recognition has been rooted in deep learning models. Despite the availability of large-scale and diverse datasets for evaluating the performance of face recognition algorithms, many of the modern datasets just combine different factors that influence face recognition, such as face pose, occlusion, illumination, facial expression and image quality. When algorithms produce errors on these datasets, it is not clear which of the factors has caused this error and, hence, there is no guidance in which direction more research is required. This work is a followup from our previous works developed in 2014 and eventually published in 2016, showing the impact of various facial aspects on face recognition algorithms. By comparing the current state-of-the-art with the best systems from the past, we demonstrate that faces under strong occlusions, some types of illumination, and strong expressions are problems mastered by deep learning algorithms, whereas recognition with low-resolution images, extreme pose variations, and open-set recognition is still an open problem. To show this, we run a sequence of experiments using six different datasets and five different face recognition algorithms in an open-source and reproducible manner. We provide the source code to run all of our experiments, which is easily extensible so that utilizing your own deep network in our evaluation is just a few minutes away.      
### 28.Deep Computational Model for the Inference of Ventricular Activation Properties  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04028.pdf)
>  Patient-specific cardiac computational models are essential for the efficient realization of precision medicine and in-silico clinical trials using digital twins. Cardiac digital twins can provide non-invasive characterizations of cardiac functions for individual patients, and therefore are promising for the patient-specific diagnosis and therapy stratification. However, current workflows for both the anatomical and functional twinning phases, referring to the inference of model anatomy and parameter from clinical data, are not sufficiently efficient, robust, and accurate. In this work, we propose a deep learning based patient-specific computational model, which can fuse both anatomical and electrophysiological information for the inference of ventricular activation properties, i.e., conduction velocities and root nodes. The activation properties can provide a quantitative assessment of cardiac electrophysiological function for the guidance of interventional procedures. We employ the Eikonal model to generate simulated electrocardiogram (ECG) with ground truth properties to train the inference model, where specific patient information has also been considered. For evaluation, we test the model on the simulated data and obtain generally promising results with fast computational time.      
### 29.Two-Stream Networks for Object Segmentation in Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04026.pdf)
>  Existing matching-based approaches perform video object segmentation (VOS) via retrieving support features from a pixel-level memory, while some pixels may suffer from lack of correspondence in the memory (i.e., unseen), which inevitably limits their segmentation performance. In this paper, we present a Two-Stream Network (TSN). Our TSN includes (i) a pixel stream with a conventional pixel-level memory, to segment the seen pixels based on their pixellevel memory retrieval. (ii) an instance stream for the unseen pixels, where a holistic understanding of the instance is obtained with dynamic segmentation heads conditioned on the features of the target instance. (iii) a pixel division module generating a routing map, with which output embeddings of the two streams are fused together. The compact instance stream effectively improves the segmentation accuracy of the unseen pixels, while fusing two streams with the adaptive routing map leads to an overall performance boost. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TSN, and we also report state-of-the-art performance of 86.1% on YouTube-VOS 2018 and 87.5% on the DAVIS-2017 validation split.      
### 30.Advancing Plain Vision Transformer Towards Remote Sensing Foundation Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03987.pdf)
>  Large-scale vision foundation models have made significant progress in visual tasks on natural images, where the vision transformers are the primary choice for their good scalability and representation ability. However, the utilization of large models in the remote sensing (RS) community remains under-explored where existing models are still at small-scale, which limits the performance. In this paper, we resort to plain vision transformers with about 100 million parameters and make the first attempt to propose large vision models customized for RS tasks and explore how such large models perform. Specifically, to handle the large image size and objects of various orientations in RS images, we propose a new rotated varied-size window attention to substitute the original full attention in transformers, which could significantly reduce the computational cost and memory footprint while learn better object representation by extracting rich context from the generated diverse windows. Experiments on detection tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model over all state-of-the-art models, achieving 81.16\% mAP on the DOTA-V1.0 dataset. The results of our models on downstream classification and segmentation tasks also demonstrate competitive performance compared with the existing advanced methods. Further experiments show the advantages of our models on computational complexity and few-shot learning.

### 31.Aerial Monocular 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03974.pdf)
>  Drones equipped with cameras can significantly enhance human ability to perceive the world because of their remarkable maneuverability in 3D space. Ironically, object detection for drones has always been conducted in the 2D image space, which fundamentally limits their ability to understand 3D scenes. Furthermore, existing 3D object detection methods developed for autonomous driving cannot be directly applied to drones due to the lack of deformation modeling, which is essential for the distant aerial perspective with sensitive distortion and small objects. To fill the gap, this work proposes a dual-view detection system named DVDET to achieve aerial monocular object detection in both the 2D image space and the 3D physical space. To address the severe view deformation issue, we propose a novel trainable geo-deformable transformation module that can properly warp information from the drone's perspective to the BEV. Compared to the monocular methods for cars, our transformation includes a learnable deformable network for explicitly revising the severe deviation. To address the dataset challenge, we propose a new large-scale simulation dataset named AM3D-Sim, generated by the co-simulation of AirSIM and CARLA, and a new real-world aerial dataset named AM3D-Real, collected by DJI Matrice 300 RTK, in both datasets, high-quality annotations for 3D object detection are provided. Extensive experiments show that i) aerial monocular 3D object detection is feasible; ii) the model pre-trained on the simulation dataset benefits real-world performance, and iii) DVDET also benefits monocular 3D object detection for cars. To encourage more researchers to investigate this area, we will release the dataset and related code in <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://sjtu-magic.github.io/dataset/AM3D/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 32.MetaGraspNet: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Scene-Aware Ambidextrous Bin Picking via Physics-based Metaverse Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03963.pdf)
>  Autonomous bin picking poses significant challenges to vision-driven robotic systems given the complexity of the problem, ranging from various sensor modalities, to highly entangled object layouts, to diverse item properties and gripper types. Existing methods often address the problem from one perspective. Diverse items and complex bin scenes require diverse picking strategies together with advanced reasoning. As such, to build robust and effective machine-learning algorithms for solving this complex task requires significant amounts of comprehensive and high quality data. Collecting such data in real world would be too expensive and time prohibitive and therefore intractable from a scalability perspective. To tackle this big, diverse data problem, we take inspiration from the recent rise in the concept of metaverses, and introduce MetaGraspNet, a large-scale photo-realistic bin picking dataset constructed via physics-based metaverse synthesis. The proposed dataset contains 217k RGBD images across 82 different article types, with full annotations for object detection, amodal perception, keypoint detection, manipulation order and ambidextrous grasp labels for a parallel-jaw and vacuum gripper. We also provide a real dataset consisting of over 2.3k fully annotated high-quality RGBD images, divided into 5 levels of difficulties and an unseen object set to evaluate different object and layout properties. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments showing that our proposed vacuum seal model and synthetic dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes to real world use-cases.      
### 33.Sampling Based On Natural Image Statistics Improves Local Surrogate Explainers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03961.pdf)
>  Many problems in computer vision have recently been tackled using models whose predictions cannot be easily interpreted, most commonly deep neural networks. Surrogate explainers are a popular post-hoc interpretability method to further understand how a model arrives at a particular prediction. By training a simple, more interpretable model to locally approximate the decision boundary of a non-interpretable system, we can estimate the relative importance of the input features on the prediction. Focusing on images, surrogate explainers, e.g., LIME, generate a local neighbourhood around a query image by sampling in an interpretable domain. However, these interpretable domains have traditionally been derived exclusively from the intrinsic features of the query image, not taking into consideration the manifold of the data the non-interpretable model has been exposed to in training (or more generally, the manifold of real images). This leads to suboptimal surrogates trained on potentially low probability images. We address this limitation by aligning the local neighbourhood on which the surrogate is trained with the original training data distribution, even when this distribution is not accessible. We propose two approaches to do so, namely (1) altering the method for sampling the local neighbourhood and (2) using perceptual metrics to convey some of the properties of the distribution of natural images.      
### 34.Abutting Grating Illusion: Cognitive Challenge to Neural Network Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03958.pdf)
>  Even the state-of-the-art deep learning models lack fundamental abilities compared to humans. Multiple comparison paradigms have been proposed to explore the distinctions between humans and deep learning. While most comparisons rely on corruptions inspired by mathematical transformations, very few have bases on human cognitive phenomena. In this study, we propose a novel corruption method based on the abutting grating illusion, which is a visual phenomenon widely discovered in both human and a wide range of animal species. The corruption method destroys the gradient-defined boundaries and generates the perception of illusory contours using line gratings abutting each other. We applied the method on MNIST, high resolution MNIST, and silhouette object images. Various deep learning models are tested on the corruption, including models trained from scratch and 109 models pretrained with ImageNet or various data augmentation techniques. Our results show that abutting grating corruption is challenging even for state-of-the-art deep learning models because most models are randomly guessing. We also discovered that the DeepAugment technique can greatly improve robustness against abutting grating illusion. Visualisation of early layers indicates that better performing models exhibit stronger end-stopping property, which is consistent with neuroscience discoveries. To validate the corruption method, 24 human subjects are involved to classify samples of corrupted datasets.      
### 35.Extrinsic Camera Calibration with Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03949.pdf)
>  Monocular camera sensors are vital to intelligent vehicle operation and automated driving assistance and are also heavily employed in traffic control infrastructure. Calibrating the monocular camera, though, is time-consuming and often requires significant manual intervention. In this work, we present an extrinsic camera calibration approach that automatizes the parameter estimation by utilizing semantic segmentation information from images and point clouds. Our approach relies on a coarse initial measurement of the camera pose and builds on lidar sensors mounted on a vehicle with high-precision localization to capture a point cloud of the camera environment. Afterward, a mapping between the camera and world coordinate spaces is obtained by performing a lidar-to-camera registration of the semantically segmented sensor data. We evaluate our method on simulated and real-world data to demonstrate low error measurements in the calibration results. Our approach is suitable for infrastructure sensors as well as vehicle sensors, while it does not require motion of the camera platform.      
### 36.AWEncoder: Adversarial Watermarking Pre-trained Encoders in Contrastive Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03948.pdf)
>  As a self-supervised learning paradigm, contrastive learning has been widely used to pre-train a powerful encoder as an effective feature extractor for various downstream tasks. This process requires numerous unlabeled training data and computational resources, which makes the pre-trained encoder become valuable intellectual property of the owner. However, the lack of a priori knowledge of downstream tasks makes it non-trivial to protect the intellectual property of the pre-trained encoder by applying conventional watermarking methods. To deal with this problem, in this paper, we introduce AWEncoder, an adversarial method for watermarking the pre-trained encoder in contrastive learning. First, as an adversarial perturbation, the watermark is generated by enforcing the training samples to be marked to deviate respective location and surround a randomly selected key image in the embedding space. Then, the watermark is embedded into the pre-trained encoder by further optimizing a joint loss function. As a result, the watermarked encoder not only performs very well for downstream tasks, but also enables us to verify its ownership by analyzing the discrepancy of output provided using the encoder as the backbone under both white-box and black-box conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed work enjoys pretty good effectiveness and robustness on different contrastive learning algorithms and downstream tasks, which has verified the superiority and applicability of the proposed work.      
### 37.Depth Quality-Inspired Feature Manipulation for Efficient RGB-D and Video Salient Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03918.pdf)
>  Recently CNN-based RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) has obtained significant improvement on detection accuracy. However, existing models often fail to perform well in terms of efficiency and accuracy simultaneously. This hinders their potential applications on mobile devices as well as many real-world problems. To bridge the accuracy gap between lightweight and large models for RGB-D SOD, in this paper, an efficient module that can greatly improve the accuracy but adds little computation is proposed. Inspired by the fact that depth quality is a key factor influencing the accuracy, we propose an efficient depth quality-inspired feature manipulation (DQFM) process, which can dynamically filter depth features according to depth quality. The proposed DQFM resorts to the alignment of low-level RGB and depth features, as well as holistic attention of the depth stream to explicitly control and enhance cross-modal fusion. We embed DQFM to obtain an efficient lightweight RGB-D SOD model called DFM-Net, where we in addition design a tailored depth backbone and a two-stage decoder as basic parts. Extensive experimental results on nine RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our DFM-Net outperforms recent efficient models, running at about 20 FPS on CPU with only 8.5Mb model size, and meanwhile being 2.9/2.4 times faster and 6.7/3.1 times smaller than the latest best models A2dele and MobileSal. It also maintains state-of-the-art accuracy when even compared to non-efficient models. Interestingly, further statistics and analyses verify the ability of DQFM in distinguishing depth maps of various qualities without any quality labels. Last but not least, we further apply DFM-Net to deal with video SOD (VSOD), achieving comparable performance against recent efficient models while being 3/2.3 times faster/smaller than the prior best in this field.

### 38.Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation via Random Amplitude Mixup and Domain-Specific Image Restoration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03901.pdf)
>  For medical image analysis, segmentation models trained on one or several domains lack generalization ability to unseen domains due to discrepancies between different data acquisition policies. We argue that the degeneration in segmentation performance is mainly attributed to overfitting to source domains and domain shift. To this end, we present a novel generalizable medical image segmentation method. To be specific, we design our approach as a multi-task paradigm by combining the segmentation model with a self-supervision domain-specific image restoration (DSIR) module for model regularization. We also design a random amplitude mixup (RAM) module, which incorporates low-level frequency information of different domain images to synthesize new images. To guide our model be resistant to domain shift, we introduce a semantic consistency loss. We demonstrate the performance of our method on two public generalizable segmentation benchmarks in medical images, which validates our method could achieve the state-of-the-art performance.      
### 39.Clear Memory-Augmented Auto-Encoder for Surface Defect Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03879.pdf)
>  In surface defect detection, due to the extreme imbalance in the number of positive and negative samples, positive-samples-based anomaly detection methods have received more and more attention. Specifically, reconstruction-based methods are the most popular. However, exiting methods are either difficult to repair abnormal foregrounds or reconstruct clear backgrounds. Therefore, we propose a clear memory-augmented auto-encoder. At first, we propose a novel clear memory-augmented module, which combines the encoding and memory-encoding in a way of forgetting and inputting, thereby repairing abnormal foregrounds and preservation clear backgrounds. Secondly, a general artificial anomaly generation algorithm is proposed to simulate anomalies that are as realistic and feature-rich as possible. At last, we propose a novel multi scale feature residual detection method for defect segmentation, which makes the defect location more accurate. CMA-AE conducts comparative experiments using 11 state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets, showing an average 18.6% average improvement in F1-measure.      
### 40.CheXRelNet: An Anatomy-Aware Model for Tracking Longitudinal Relationships between Chest X-Rays  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03873.pdf)
>  Despite the progress in utilizing deep learning to automate chest radiograph interpretation and disease diagnosis tasks, change between sequential Chest X-rays (CXRs) has received limited attention. Monitoring the progression of pathologies that are visualized through chest imaging poses several challenges in anatomical motion estimation and image registration, i.e., spatially aligning the two images and modeling temporal dynamics in change detection. In this work, we propose CheXRelNet, a neural model that can track longitudinal pathology change relations between two CXRs. CheXRelNet incorporates local and global visual features, utilizes inter-image and intra-image anatomical information, and learns dependencies between anatomical region attributes, to accurately predict disease change for a pair of CXRs. Experimental results on the Chest ImaGenome dataset show increased downstream performance compared to baselines.

### 41.RadSegNet: A Reliable Approach to Radar Camera Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03849.pdf)
>  Perception systems for autonomous driving have seen significant advancements in their performance over last few years. However, these systems struggle to show robustness in extreme weather conditions because sensors like lidars and cameras, which are the primary sensors in a sensor suite, see a decline in performance under these conditions. In order to solve this problem, camera-radar fusion systems provide a unique opportunity for all weather reliable high quality perception. Cameras provides rich semantic information while radars can work through occlusions and in all weather conditions. In this work, we show that the state-of-the-art fusion methods perform poorly when camera input is degraded, which essentially results in losing the all-weather reliability they set out to achieve. Contrary to these approaches, we propose a new method, RadSegNet, that uses a new design philosophy of independent information extraction and truly achieves reliability in all conditions, including occlusions and adverse weather. We develop and validate our proposed system on the benchmark Astyx dataset and further verify these results on the RADIATE dataset. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, RadSegNet achieves a 27% improvement on Astyx and 41.46% increase on RADIATE, in average precision score and maintains a significantly better performance in adverse weather conditions      
### 42.Fine-Grained Egocentric Hand-Object Segmentation: Dataset, Model, and Applications  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03826.pdf)
>  Egocentric videos offer fine-grained information for high-fidelity modeling of human behaviors. Hands and interacting objects are one crucial aspect of understanding a viewer's behaviors and intentions. We provide a labeled dataset consisting of 11,243 egocentric images with per-pixel segmentation labels of hands and objects being interacted with during a diverse array of daily activities. Our dataset is the first to label detailed hand-object contact boundaries. We introduce a context-aware compositional data augmentation technique to adapt to out-of-distribution YouTube egocentric video. We show that our robust hand-object segmentation model and dataset can serve as a foundational tool to boost or enable several downstream vision applications, including hand state classification, video activity recognition, 3D mesh reconstruction of hand-object interactions, and video inpainting of hand-object foregrounds in egocentric videos.

### 43.Towards Graph Representation Learning Based Surgical Workflow Anticipation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03824.pdf)
>  Surgical workflow anticipation can give predictions on what steps to conduct or what instruments to use next, which is an essential part of the computer-assisted intervention system for surgery, e.g. workflow reasoning in robotic surgery. However, current approaches are limited to their insufficient expressive power for relationships between instruments. Hence, we propose a graph representation learning framework to comprehensively represent instrument motions in the surgical workflow anticipation problem. In our proposed graph representation, we maps the bounding box information of instruments to the graph nodes in the consecutive frames and build inter-frame/inter-instrument graph edges to represent the trajectory and interaction of the instruments over time. This design enhances the ability of our network on modeling both the spatial and temporal patterns of surgical instruments and their interactions. In addition, we design a multi-horizon learning strategy to balance the understanding of various horizons indifferent anticipation tasks, which significantly improves the model performance in anticipation with various horizons. Experiments on the Cholec80 dataset demonstrate the performance of our proposed method can exceed the state-of-the-art method based on richer backbones, especially in instrument anticipation (1.27 v.s. 1.48 for inMAE; 1.48 v.s. 2.68 for eMAE). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a spatial-temporal graph representation into surgical workflow anticipation.      
### 44.Cross-Skeleton Interaction Graph Aggregation Network for Representation Learning of Mouse Social Behaviour  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03819.pdf)
>  Automated social behaviour analysis of mice has become an increasingly popular research area in behavioural neuroscience. Recently, pose information (i.e., locations of keypoints or skeleton) has been used to interpret social behaviours of mice. Nevertheless, effective encoding and decoding of social interaction information underlying the keypoints of mice has been rarely investigated in the existing methods. In particular, it is challenging to model complex social interactions between mice due to highly deformable body shapes and ambiguous movement patterns. To deal with the interaction modelling problem, we here propose a Cross-Skeleton Interaction Graph Aggregation Network (CS-IGANet) to learn abundant dynamics of freely interacting mice, where a Cross-Skeleton Node-level Interaction module (CS-NLI) is used to model multi-level interactions (i.e., intra-, inter- and cross-skeleton interactions). Furthermore, we design a novel Interaction-Aware Transformer (IAT) to dynamically learn the graph-level representation of social behaviours and update the node-level representation, guided by our proposed interaction-aware self-attention mechanism. Finally, to enhance the representation ability of our model, an auxiliary self-supervised learning task is proposed for measuring the similarity between cross-skeleton nodes. Experimental results on the standard CRMI13-Skeleton and our PDMB-Skeleton datasets show that our proposed model outperforms several other state-of-the-art approaches.      
### 45.Domain Randomization-Enhanced Depth Simulation and Restoration for Perceiving and Grasping Specular and Transparent Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03792.pdf)
>  Commercial depth sensors usually generate noisy and missing depths, especially on specular and transparent objects, which poses critical issues to downstream depth or point cloud-based tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose a powerful RGBD fusion network, SwinDRNet, for depth restoration. We further propose Domain Randomization-Enhanced Depth Simulation (DREDS) approach to simulate an active stereo depth system using physically based rendering and generate a large-scale synthetic dataset that contains 130K photorealistic RGB images along with their simulated depths carrying realistic sensor noises. To evaluate depth restoration methods, we also curate a real-world dataset, namely STD, that captures 30 cluttered scenes composed of 50 objects with different materials from specular, transparent, to diffuse. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed DREDS dataset bridges the sim-to-real domain gap such that, trained on DREDS, our SwinDRNet can seamlessly generalize to other real depth datasets, e.g. ClearGrasp, and outperform the competing methods on depth restoration with a real-time speed. We further show that our depth restoration effectively boosts the performance of downstream tasks, including category-level pose estimation and grasping tasks.

### 46.Global Hierarchical Attention for 3D Point Cloud Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03791.pdf)
>  We propose a new attention mechanism, called Global Hierarchical Attention (GHA), for 3D point cloud analysis. GHA approximates the regular global dot-product attention via a series of coarsening and interpolation operations over multiple hierarchy levels. The advantage of GHA is two-fold. First, it has linear complexity with respect to the number of points, enabling the processing of large point clouds. Second, GHA inherently possesses the inductive bias to focus on spatially close points, while retaining the global connectivity among all points. Combined with a feedforward network, GHA can be inserted into many existing network architectures. We experiment with multiple baseline networks and show that adding GHA consistently improves performance across different tasks and datasets. For the task of semantic segmentation, GHA gives a +1.7% mIoU increase to the MinkowskiEngine baseline on ScanNet. For the 3D object detection task, GHA improves the CenterPoint baseline by +0.5% mAP on the nuScenes dataset, and the 3DETR baseline by +2.1% mAP25 and +1.5% mAP50 on ScanNet.      
### 47.Sample hardness based gradient loss for long-tailed cervical cell detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03779.pdf)
>  Due to the difficulty of cancer samples collection and annotation, cervical cancer datasets usually exhibit a long-tailed data distribution. When training a detector to detect the cancer cells in a WSI (Whole Slice Image) image captured from the TCT (Thinprep Cytology Test) specimen, head categories (e.g. normal cells and inflammatory cells) typically have a much larger number of samples than tail categories (e.g. cancer cells). Most existing state-of-the-art long-tailed learning methods in object detection focus on category distribution statistics to solve the problem in the long-tailed scenario without considering the "hardness" of each sample. To address this problem, in this work we propose a Grad-Libra Loss that leverages the gradients to dynamically calibrate the degree of hardness of each sample for different categories, and re-balance the gradients of positive and negative samples. Our loss can thus help the detector to put more emphasis on those hard samples in both head and tail categories. Extensive experiments on a long-tailed TCT WSI image dataset show that the mainstream detectors, e.g. RepPoints, FCOS, ATSS, YOLOF, etc. trained using our proposed Gradient-Libra Loss, achieved much higher (7.8%) mAP than that trained using cross-entropy classification loss.      
### 48.Video-based Human Action Recognition using Deep Learning: A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03775.pdf)
>  Human action recognition is an important application domain in computer vision. Its primary aim is to accurately describe human actions and their interactions from a previously unseen data sequence acquired by sensors. The ability to recognize, understand, and predict complex human actions enables the construction of many important applications such as intelligent surveillance systems, human-computer interfaces, health care, security, and military applications. In recent years, deep learning has been given particular attention by the computer vision community. This paper presents an overview of the current state-of-the-art in action recognition using video analysis with deep learning techniques. We present the most important deep learning models for recognizing human actions, and analyze them to provide the current progress of deep learning algorithms applied to solve human action recognition problems in realistic videos highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Based on the quantitative analysis using recognition accuracies reported in the literature, our study identifies state-of-the-art deep architectures in action recognition and then provides current trends and open problems for future works in this field.      
### 49.Class-Incremental Learning with Cross-Space Clustering and Controlled Transfer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03767.pdf)
>  In class-incremental learning, the model is expected to learn new classes continually while maintaining knowledge on previous classes. The challenge here lies in preserving the model's ability to effectively represent prior classes in the feature space, while adapting it to represent incoming new classes. We propose two distillation-based objectives for class incremental learning that leverage the structure of the feature space to maintain accuracy on previous classes, as well as enable learning the new classes. In our first objective, termed cross-space clustering (CSC), we propose to use the feature space structure of the previous model to characterize directions of optimization that maximally preserve the class - directions that all instances of a specific class should collectively optimize towards, and those that they should collectively optimize away from. Apart from minimizing forgetting, this indirectly encourages the model to cluster all instances of a class in the current feature space, and gives rise to a sense of herd-immunity, allowing all samples of a class to jointly combat the model from forgetting the class. Our second objective termed controlled transfer (CT) tackles incremental learning from an understudied perspective of inter-class transfer. CT explicitly approximates and conditions the current model on the semantic similarities between incrementally arriving classes and prior classes. This allows the model to learn classes in such a way that it maximizes positive forward transfer from similar prior classes, thus increasing plasticity, and minimizes negative backward transfer on dissimilar prior classes, whereby strengthening stability. We perform extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, adding our method (CSCCT) on top of three prominent class-incremental learning methods. We observe consistent performance improvement on a variety of experimental settings.      
### 50.Hierarchical Semantic Regularization of Latent Spaces in StyleGANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03764.pdf)
>  Progress in GANs has enabled the generation of high-resolution photorealistic images of astonishing quality. StyleGANs allow for compelling attribute modification on such images via mathematical operations on the latent style vectors in the W/W+ space that effectively modulate the rich hierarchical representations of the generator. Such operations have recently been generalized beyond mere attribute swapping in the original StyleGAN paper to include interpolations. In spite of many significant improvements in StyleGANs, they are still seen to generate unnatural images. The quality of the generated images is predicated on two assumptions; (a) The richness of the hierarchical representations learnt by the generator, and, (b) The linearity and smoothness of the style spaces. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Regularizer (HSR) which aligns the hierarchical representations learnt by the generator to corresponding powerful features learnt by pretrained networks on large amounts of data. HSR is shown to not only improve generator representations but also the linearity and smoothness of the latent style spaces, leading to the generation of more natural-looking style-edited images. To demonstrate improved linearity, we propose a novel metric - Attribute Linearity Score (ALS). A significant reduction in the generation of unnatural images is corroborated by improvement in the Perceptual Path Length (PPL) metric by 16.19% averaged across different standard datasets while simultaneously improving the linearity of attribute-change in the attribute editing tasks.      
### 51.Label Semantic Knowledge Distillation for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03763.pdf)
>  The Scene Graph Generation (SGG) task aims to detect all the objects and their pairwise visual relationships in a given image. Although SGG has achieved remarkable progress over the last few years, almost all existing SGG models follow the same training paradigm: they treat both object and predicate classification in SGG as a single-label classification problem, and the ground-truths are one-hot target labels. However, this prevalent training paradigm has overlooked two characteristics of current SGG datasets: 1) For positive samples, some specific subject-object instances may have multiple reasonable predicates. 2) For negative samples, there are numerous missing annotations. Regardless of the two characteristics, SGG models are easy to be confused and make wrong predictions. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Label Semantic Knowledge Distillation (LS-KD) for unbiased SGG. Specifically, LS-KD dynamically generates a soft label for each subject-object instance by fusing a predicted Label Semantic Distribution (LSD) with its original one-hot target label. LSD reflects the correlations between this instance and multiple predicate categories. Meanwhile, we propose two different strategies to predict LSD: iterative self-KD and synchronous self-KD. Extensive ablations and results on three SGG tasks have attested to the superiority and generality of our proposed LS-KD, which can consistently achieve decent trade-off performance between different predicate categories.      
### 52.PS-NeRV: Patch-wise Stylized Neural Representations for Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03742.pdf)
>  We study how to represent a video with implicit neural representations (INRs). Classical INRs methods generally utilize MLPs to map input coordinates to output pixels. While some recent works have tried to directly reconstruct the whole image with CNNs. However, we argue that both the above pixel-wise and image-wise strategies are not favorable to video data. Instead, we propose a patch-wise solution, PS-NeRV, which represents videos as a function of patches and the corresponding patch coordinate. It naturally inherits the advantages of image-wise methods, and achieves excellent reconstruction performance with fast decoding speed. The whole method includes conventional modules, like positional embedding, MLPs and CNNs, while also introduces AdaIN to enhance intermediate features. These simple yet essential changes could help the network easily fit high-frequency details. Extensive experiments have demonstrated its effectiveness in several video-related tasks, such as video compression and video inpainting.      
### 53.Robust Multi-Object Tracking by Marginal Inference  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03727.pdf)
>  Multi-object tracking in videos requires to solve a fundamental problem of one-to-one assignment between objects in adjacent frames. Most methods address the problem by first discarding impossible pairs whose feature distances are larger than a threshold, followed by linking objects using Hungarian algorithm to minimize the overall distance. However, we find that the distribution of the distances computed from Re-ID features may vary significantly for different videos. So there isn't a single optimal threshold which allows us to safely discard impossible pairs. To address the problem, we present an efficient approach to compute a marginal probability for each pair of objects in real time. The marginal probability can be regarded as a normalized distance which is significantly more stable than the original feature distance. As a result, we can use a single threshold for all videos. The approach is general and can be applied to the existing trackers to obtain about one point improvement in terms of IDF1 metric. It achieves competitive results on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks. In addition, the computed probability is more interpretable which facilitates subsequent post-processing operations.      
### 54.PDO-s3DCNNs: Partial Differential Operator Based Steerable 3D CNNs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03720.pdf)
>  Steerable models can provide very general and flexible equivariance by formulating equivariance requirements in the language of representation theory and feature fields, which has been recognized to be effective for many vision tasks. However, deriving steerable models for 3D rotations is much more difficult than that in the 2D case, due to more complicated mathematics of 3D rotations. In this work, we employ partial differential operators (PDOs) to model 3D filters, and derive general steerable 3D CNNs, which are called PDO-s3DCNNs. We prove that the equivariant filters are subject to linear constraints, which can be solved efficiently under various conditions. As far as we know, PDO-s3DCNNs are the most general steerable CNNs for 3D rotations, in the sense that they cover all common subgroups of $SO(3)$ and their representations, while existing methods can only be applied to specific groups and representations. Extensive experiments show that our models can preserve equivariance well in the discrete domain, and outperform previous works on SHREC'17 retrieval and ISBI 2012 segmentation tasks with a low network complexity.      
### 55.Jointformer: Single-Frame Lifting Transformer with Error Prediction and Refinement for 3D Human Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03704.pdf)
>  Monocular 3D human pose estimation technologies have the potential to greatly increase the availability of human movement data. The best-performing models for single-image 2D-3D lifting use graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that typically require some manual input to define the relationships between different body joints. We propose a novel transformer-based approach that uses the more generalised self-attention mechanism to learn these relationships within a sequence of tokens representing joints. We find that the use of intermediate supervision, as well as residual connections between the stacked encoders benefits performance. We also suggest that using error prediction as part of a multi-task learning framework improves performance by allowing the network to compensate for its confidence level. We perform extensive ablation studies to show that each of our contributions increases performance. Furthermore, we show that our approach outperforms the recent state of the art for single-frame 3D human pose estimation by a large margin. Our code and trained models are made publicly available on Github.      
### 56.Preserving Fine-Grain Feature Information in Classification via Entropic Regularization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03684.pdf)
>  Labeling a classification dataset implies to define classes and associated coarse labels, that may approximate a smoother and more complicated ground truth. For example, natural images may contain multiple objects, only one of which is labeled in many vision datasets, or classes may result from the discretization of a regression problem. Using cross-entropy to train classification models on such coarse labels is likely to roughly cut through the feature space, potentially disregarding the most meaningful such features, in particular losing information on the underlying fine-grain task. In this paper we are interested in the problem of solving fine-grain classification or regression, using a model trained on coarse-grain labels only. We show that standard cross-entropy can lead to overfitting to coarse-related features. We introduce an entropy-based regularization to promote more diversity in the feature space of trained models, and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology to reach better performance on the fine-grain problems. Our results are supported through theoretical developments and empirical validation.      
### 57.CVLNet: Cross-View Semantic Correspondence Learning for Video-based Camera Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03660.pdf)
>  This paper tackles the problem of Cross-view Video-based camera Localization (CVL). The task is to localize a query camera by leveraging information from its past observations, i.e., a continuous sequence of images observed at previous time stamps, and matching them to a large overhead-view satellite image. The critical challenge of this task is to learn a powerful global feature descriptor for the sequential ground-view images while considering its domain alignment with reference satellite images. For this purpose, we introduce CVLNet, which first projects the sequential ground-view images into an overhead view by exploring the ground-and-overhead geometric correspondences and then leverages the photo consistency among the projected images to form a global representation. In this way, the cross-view domain differences are bridged. Since the reference satellite images are usually pre-cropped and regularly sampled, there is always a misalignment between the query camera location and its matching satellite image center. Motivated by this, we propose estimating the query camera's relative displacement to a satellite image before similarity matching. In this displacement estimation process, we also consider the uncertainty of the camera location. For example, a camera is unlikely to be on top of trees. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we collect satellite images from Google Map for the KITTI dataset and construct a new cross-view video-based localization benchmark dataset, KITTI-CVL. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of video-based localization over single image-based localization and the superiority of each proposed module over other alternatives.      
### 58.Fast Online and Relational Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03659.pdf)
>  To overcome challenges in multiple object tracking task, recent algorithms use interaction cues alongside motion and appearance features. These algorithms use graph neural networks or transformers to extract interaction features that lead to high computation costs. In this paper, a novel interaction cue based on geometric features is presented aiming to detect occlusion and re-identify lost targets with low computational cost. Moreover, in most algorithms, camera motion is considered negligible, which is a strong assumption that is not always true and leads to ID Switch or mismatching of targets. In this paper, a method for measuring camera motion and removing its effect is presented that efficiently reduces the camera motion effect on tracking. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets and it achieves the state-of-the-art performance of MOT17 and comparable results on MOT20. The code is also publicly available.      
### 59.Weakly Supervised Online Action Detection for Infant General Movements  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03648.pdf)
>  To make the earlier medical intervention of infants' cerebral palsy (CP), early diagnosis of brain damage is critical. Although general movements assessment(GMA) has shown promising results in early CP detection, it is laborious. Most existing works take videos as input to make fidgety movements(FMs) classification for the GMA automation. Those methods require a complete observation of videos and can not localize video frames containing normal FMs. Therefore we propose a novel approach named WO-GMA to perform FMs localization in the weakly supervised online setting. Infant body keypoints are first extracted as the inputs to WO-GMA. Then WO-GMA performs local spatio-temporal extraction followed by two network branches to generate pseudo clip labels and model online actions. With the clip-level pseudo labels, the action modeling branch learns to detect FMs in an online fashion. Experimental results on a dataset with 757 videos of different infants show that WO-GMA can get state-of-the-art video-level classification and cliplevel detection results. Moreover, only the first 20% duration of the video is needed to get classification results as good as fully observed, implying a significantly shortened FMs diagnosis time.

### 60.Label-Efficient Domain Generalization via Collaborative Exploration and Generalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03644.pdf)
>  Considerable progress has been made in domain generalization (DG) which aims to learn a generalizable model from multiple well-annotated source domains to unknown target domains. However, it can be prohibitively expensive to obtain sufficient annotation for source datasets in many real scenarios. To escape from the dilemma between domain generalization and annotation costs, in this paper, we introduce a novel task named label-efficient domain generalization (LEDG) to enable model generalization with label-limited source domains. To address this challenging task, we propose a novel framework called Collaborative Exploration and Generalization (CEG) which jointly optimizes active exploration and semi-supervised generalization. Specifically, in active exploration, to explore class and domain discriminability while avoiding information divergence and redundancy, we query the labels of the samples with the highest overall ranking of class uncertainty, domain representativeness, and information diversity. In semi-supervised generalization, we design MixUp-based intra- and inter-domain knowledge augmentation to expand domain knowledge and generalize domain invariance. We unify active exploration and semi-supervised generalization in a collaborative way and promote mutual enhancement between them, boosting model generalization with limited annotation. Extensive experiments show that CEG yields superior generalization performance. In particular, CEG can even use only 5% data annotation budget to achieve competitive results compared to the previous DG methods with fully labeled data on PACS dataset.      
### 61.No More Strided Convolutions or Pooling: A New CNN Building Block for Low-Resolution Images and Small Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03641.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made resounding success in many computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. However, their performance degrades rapidly on tougher tasks where images are of low resolution or objects are small. In this paper, we point out that this roots in a defective yet common design in existing CNN architectures, namely the use of strided convolution and/or pooling layers, which results in a loss of fine-grained information and learning of less effective feature representations. To this end, we propose a new CNN building block called SPD-Conv in place of each strided convolution layer and each pooling layer (thus eliminates them altogether). SPD-Conv is comprised of a space-to-depth (SPD) layer followed by a non-strided convolution (Conv) layer, and can be applied in most if not all CNN architectures. We explain this new design under two most representative computer vision tasks: object detection and image classification. We then create new CNN architectures by applying SPD-Conv to YOLOv5 and ResNet, and empirically show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models, especially on tougher tasks with low-resolution images and small objects.

### 62.Graph R-CNN: Towards Accurate 3D Object Detection with Semantic-Decorated Local Graph  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03624.pdf)
>  Two-stage detectors have gained much popularity in 3D object detection. Most two-stage 3D detectors utilize grid points, voxel grids, or sampled keypoints for RoI feature extraction in the second stage. Such methods, however, are inefficient in handling unevenly distributed and sparse outdoor points. This paper solves this problem in three aspects. 1) Dynamic Point Aggregation. We propose the patch search to quickly search points in a local region for each 3D proposal. The dynamic farthest voxel sampling is then applied to evenly sample the points. Especially, the voxel size varies along the distance to accommodate the uneven distribution of points. 2) RoI-graph Pooling. We build local graphs on the sampled points to better model contextual information and mine point relations through iterative message passing. 3) Visual Features Augmentation. We introduce a simple yet effective fusion strategy to compensate for sparse LiDAR points with limited semantic cues. Based on these modules, we construct our Graph R-CNN as the second stage, which can be applied to existing one-stage detectors to consistently improve the detection performance. Extensive experiments show that Graph R-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D detection models by a large margin on both the KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset. And we rank first place on the KITTI BEV car detection leaderboard.

### 63.Learning Omnidirectional Flow in 360-degree Video via Siamese Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03620.pdf)
>  Optical flow estimation in omnidirectional videos faces two significant issues: the lack of benchmark datasets and the challenge of adapting perspective video-based methods to accommodate the omnidirectional nature. This paper proposes the first perceptually natural-synthetic omnidirectional benchmark dataset with a 360-degree field of view, FLOW360, with 40 different videos and 4,000 video frames. We conduct comprehensive characteristic analysis and comparisons between our dataset and existing optical flow datasets, which manifest perceptual realism, uniqueness, and diversity. To accommodate the omnidirectional nature, we present a novel Siamese representation Learning framework for Omnidirectional Flow (SLOF). We train our network in a contrastive manner with a hybrid loss function that combines contrastive loss and optical flow loss. Extensive experiments verify the proposed framework's effectiveness and show up to 40% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art approaches. Our FLOW360 dataset and code are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://siamlof.github.io/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 64.Shap-CAM: Visual Explanations for Convolutional Neural Networks based on Shapley Value  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03608.pdf)
>  Explaining deep convolutional neural networks has been recently drawing increasing attention since it helps to understand the networks' internal operations and why they make certain decisions. Saliency maps, which emphasize salient regions largely connected to the network's decision-making, are one of the most common ways for visualizing and analyzing deep networks in the computer vision community. However, saliency maps generated by existing methods cannot represent authentic information in images due to the unproven proposals about the weights of activation maps which lack solid theoretical foundation and fail to consider the relations between each pixel. In this paper, we develop a novel post-hoc visual explanation method called Shap-CAM based on class activation mapping. Unlike previous gradient-based approaches, Shap-CAM gets rid of the dependence on gradients by obtaining the importance of each pixel through Shapley value. We demonstrate that Shap-CAM achieves better visual performance and fairness for interpreting the decision making process. Our approach outperforms previous methods on both recognition and localization tasks.      
### 65.Improved Pancreatic Tumor Detection by Utilizing Clinically-Relevant Secondary Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03581.pdf)
>  Pancreatic cancer is one of the global leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Despite the success of Deep Learning in computer-aided diagnosis and detection (CAD) methods, little attention has been paid to the detection of Pancreatic Cancer. We propose a method for detecting pancreatic tumor that utilizes clinically-relevant features in the surrounding anatomical structures, thereby better aiming to exploit the radiologist's knowledge compared to other, conventional deep learning approaches. To this end, we collect a new dataset consisting of 99 cases with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and 97 control cases without any pancreatic tumor. Due to the growth pattern of pancreatic cancer, the tumor may not be always visible as a hypodense lesion, therefore experts refer to the visibility of secondary external features that may indicate the presence of the tumor. We propose a method based on a U-Net-like Deep CNN that exploits the following external secondary features: the pancreatic duct, common bile duct and the pancreas, along with a processed CT scan. Using these features, the model segments the pancreatic tumor if it is present. This segmentation for classification and localization approach achieves a performance of 99% sensitivity (one case missed) and 99% specificity, which realizes a 5% increase in sensitivity over the previous state-of-the-art method. The model additionally provides location information with reasonable accuracy and a shorter inference time compared to previous PDAC detection methods. These results offer a significant performance improvement and highlight the importance of incorporating the knowledge of the clinical expert when developing novel CAD methods.      
### 66.Transformer-based assignment decision network for multiple object tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03571.pdf)
>  Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or either tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame adding significant computational complexity in any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, we designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrate the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on two popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker which lacks significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification. The implementation of our method is publicly available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/psaltaath/tadn-mot" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 67.HSIC-InfoGAN: Learning Unsupervised Disentangled Representations by Maximising Approximated Mutual Information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03563.pdf)
>  Learning disentangled representations requires either supervision or the introduction of specific model designs and learning constraints as biases. InfoGAN is a popular disentanglement framework that learns unsupervised disentangled representations by maximising the mutual information between latent representations and their corresponding generated images. Maximisation of mutual information is achieved by introducing an auxiliary network and training with a latent regression loss. In this short exploratory paper, we study the use of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to approximate mutual information between latent representation and image, termed HSIC-InfoGAN. Directly optimising the HSIC loss avoids the need for an additional auxiliary network. We qualitatively compare the level of disentanglement in each model, suggest a strategy to tune the hyperparameters of HSIC-InfoGAN, and discuss the potential of HSIC-InfoGAN for medical applications.      
### 68.Study of detecting behavioral signatures within DeepFake videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03561.pdf)
>  There is strong interest in the generation of synthetic video imagery of people talking for various purposes, including entertainment, communication, training, and advertisement. With the development of deep fake generation models, synthetic video imagery will soon be visually indistinguishable to the naked eye from a naturally capture video. In addition, many methods are continuing to improve to avoid more careful, forensic visual analysis. Some deep fake videos are produced through the use of facial puppetry, which directly controls the head and face of the synthetic image through the movements of the actor, allow the actor to 'puppet' the image of another. In this paper, we address the question of whether one person's movements can be distinguished from the original speaker by controlling the visual appearance of the speaker but transferring the behavior signals from another source. We conduct a study by comparing synthetic imagery that: 1) originates from a different person speaking a different utterance, 2) originates from the same person speaking a different utterance, and 3) originates from a different person speaking the same utterance. Our study shows that synthetic videos in all three cases are seen as less real and less engaging than the original source video. Our results indicate that there could be a behavioral signature that is detectable from a person's movements that is separate from their visual appearance, and that this behavioral signature could be used to distinguish a deep fake from a properly captured video.      
### 69.Inpainting at Modern Camera Resolution by Guided PatchMatch with Auto-Curation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03552.pdf)
>  Recently, deep models have established SOTA performance for low-resolution image inpainting, but they lack fidelity at resolutions associated with modern cameras such as 4K or more, and for large holes. We contribute an inpainting benchmark dataset of photos at 4K and above representative of modern sensors. We demonstrate a novel framework that combines deep learning and traditional methods. We use an existing deep inpainting model LaMa to fill the hole plausibly, establish three guide images consisting of structure, segmentation, depth, and apply a multiply-guided PatchMatch to produce eight candidate upsampled inpainted images. Next, we feed all candidate inpaintings through a novel curation module that chooses a good inpainting by column summation on an 8x8 antisymmetric pairwise preference matrix. Our framework's results are overwhelmingly preferred by users over 8 strong baselines, with improvements of quantitative metrics up to 7.4 over the best baseline LaMa, and our technique when paired with 4 different SOTA inpainting backbones improves each such that ours is overwhelmingly preferred by users over a strong super-res baseline.      
### 70.Frozen CLIP Models are Efficient Video Learners  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03550.pdf)
>  Video recognition has been dominated by the end-to-end learning paradigm -- first initializing a video recognition model with weights of a pretrained image model and then conducting end-to-end training on videos. This enables the video network to benefit from the pretrained image model. However, this requires substantial computation and memory resources for finetuning on videos and the alternative of directly using pretrained image features without finetuning the image backbone leads to subpar results. Fortunately, recent advances in Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training (CLIP) pave the way for a new route for visual recognition tasks. Pretrained on large open-vocabulary image-text pair data, these models learn powerful visual representations with rich semantics. In this paper, we present Efficient Video Learning (EVL) -- an efficient framework for directly training high-quality video recognition models with frozen CLIP features. Specifically, we employ a lightweight Transformer decoder and learn a query token to dynamically collect frame-level spatial features from the CLIP image encoder. Furthermore, we adopt a local temporal module in each decoder layer to discover temporal clues from adjacent frames and their attention maps. We show that despite being efficient to train with a frozen backbone, our models learn high quality video representations on a variety of video recognition datasets.

### 71.MonoViT: Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with a Vision Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03543.pdf)
>  Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is an attractive solution that does not require hard-to-source depth labels for training. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved great success in this task. However, their limited receptive field constrains existing network architectures to reason only locally, dampening the effectiveness of the self-supervised paradigm. In the light of the recent successes achieved by Vision Transformers (ViTs), we propose MonoViT, a brand-new framework combining the global reasoning enabled by ViT models with the flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation. By combining plain convolutions with Transformer blocks, our model can reason locally and globally, yielding depth prediction at a higher level of detail and accuracy, allowing MonoViT to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the established KITTI dataset. Moreover, MonoViT proves its superior generalization capacities on other datasets such as Make3D and DrivingStereo.      
### 72.Multiplex-detection Based Multiple Instance Learning Network for Whole Slide Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03526.pdf)
>  Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a powerful approach to classify whole slide images (WSIs) for diagnostic pathology. A fundamental challenge of MIL on WSI classification is to discover the \textit{critical instances} that trigger the bag label. However, previous methods are primarily designed under the independent and identical distribution hypothesis (\textit{i.i.d}), ignoring either the correlations between instances or heterogeneity of tumours. In this paper, we propose a novel multiplex-detection-based multiple instance learning (MDMIL) to tackle the issues above. Specifically, MDMIL is constructed by the internal query generation module (IQGM) and the multiplex detection module (MDM) and assisted by the memory-based contrastive loss during training. Firstly, IQGM gives the probability of instances and generates the internal query (IQ) for the subsequent MDM by aggregating highly reliable features after the distribution analysis. Secondly, the multiplex-detection cross-attention (MDCA) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in MDM cooperate to generate the final representations for the WSI. In this process, the IQ and trainable variational query (VQ) successfully build up the connections between instances and significantly improve the model's robustness toward heterogeneous tumours. At last, to further enforce constraints in the feature space and stabilize the training process, we adopt a memory-based contrastive loss, which is practicable for WSI classification even with a single sample as input in each iteration. We conduct experiments on three computational pathology datasets, e.g., CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC datasets. The superior accuracy and AUC demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MDMIL over other state-of-the-art methods.      
### 73.Semiconductor Defect Detection by Hybrid Classical-Quantum Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03514.pdf)
>  With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology, the demand for semiconductors is projected to rise substantially. However, the massive expansion of semiconductor manufacturing and the development of new technology will bring many defect wafers. If these defect wafers have not been correctly inspected, the ineffective semiconductor processing on these defect wafers will cause additional impact to our environment, such as excessive carbon dioxide emission and energy consumption. In this paper, we utilize the information processing advantages of quantum computing to promote the defect learning defect review (DLDR). We propose a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm for deep learning on near-term quantum processors. By tuning parameters implemented on it, quantum circuit driven by our framework learns a given DLDR task, include of wafer defect map classification, defect pattern classification, and hotspot detection. In addition, we explore parametrized quantum circuits with different expressibility and entangling capacities. These results can be used to build a future roadmap to develop circuit-based quantum deep learning for semiconductor defect detection.      
### 74.Multi-Task Transformer with uncertainty modelling for Face Based Affective Computing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03506.pdf)
>  Face based affective computing consists in detecting emotions from face images. It is useful to unlock better automatic comprehension of human behaviours and could pave the way toward improved human-machines interactions. However it comes with the challenging task of designing a computational representation of emotions. So far, emotions have been represented either continuously in the 2D Valence/Arousal space or in a discrete manner with Ekman's 7 basic emotions. Alternatively, Ekman's Facial Action Unit (AU) system have also been used to caracterize emotions using a codebook of unitary muscular activations. ABAW3 and ABAW4 Multi-Task Challenges are the first work to provide a large scale database annotated with those three types of labels. In this paper we present a transformer based multi-task method for jointly learning to predict valence arousal, action units and basic emotions. From an architectural standpoint our method uses a taskwise token approach to efficiently model the similarities between the tasks. From a learning point of view we use an uncertainty weighted loss for modelling the difference of stochasticity between the three tasks annotations.      
### 75.Contrastive Positive Mining for Unsupervised 3D Action Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03497.pdf)
>  Recent contrastive based 3D action representation learning has made great progress. However, the strict positive/negative constraint is yet to be relaxed and the use of non-self positive is yet to be explored. In this paper, a Contrastive Positive Mining (CPM) framework is proposed for unsupervised skeleton 3D action representation learning. The CPM identifies non-self positives in a contextual queue to boost learning. Specifically, the siamese encoders are adopted and trained to match the similarity distributions of the augmented instances in reference to all instances in the contextual queue. By identifying the non-self positive instances in the queue, a positive-enhanced learning strategy is proposed to leverage the knowledge of mined positives to boost the robustness of the learned latent space against intra-class and inter-class diversity. Experimental results have shown that the proposed CPM is effective and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on the challenging NTU and PKU-MMD datasets.      
### 76.HaloAE: An HaloNet based Local Transformer Auto-Encoder for Anomaly Detection and Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03486.pdf)
>  Unsupervised anomaly detection and localization is a crucial task as it is impossible to collect and label all possible anomalies. Many studies have emphasized the importance of integrating local and global information to achieve accurate segmentation of anomalies. To this end, there has been a growing interest in Transformer, which allows modeling long-range content interactions. However, global interactions through self attention are generally too expensive for most image scales. In this study, we introduce HaloAE, the first auto-encoder based on a local 2D version of Transformer with HaloNet. With HaloAE, we have created a hybrid model that combines convolution and local 2D block-wise self-attention layers and jointly performs anomaly detection and segmentation through a single model. We achieved competitive results on the MVTec dataset, suggesting that vision models incorporating Transformer could benefit from a local computation of the self-attention operation, and pave the way for other applications.      
### 77.Analysing the Memorability of a Procedural Crime-Drama TV Series, CSI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03479.pdf)
>  We investigate the memorability of a 5-season span of a popular crime-drama TV series, CSI, through the application of a vision transformer fine-tuned on the task of predicting video memorability. By investigating the popular genre of crime-drama TV through the use of a detailed annotated corpus combined with video memorability scores, we show how to extrapolate meaning from the memorability scores generated on video shots. We perform a quantitative analysis to relate video shot memorability to a variety of aspects of the show. The insights we present in this paper illustrate the importance of video memorability in applications which use multimedia in areas like education, marketing, indexing, as well as in the case here namely TV and film production.      
### 78.Learning Human Cognitive Appraisal Through Reinforcement Memory Unit  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03473.pdf)
>  We propose a novel memory-enhancing mechanism for recurrent neural networks that exploits the effect of human cognitive appraisal in sequential assessment tasks. We conceptualize the memory-enhancing mechanism as Reinforcement Memory Unit (RMU) that contains an appraisal state together with two positive and negative reinforcement memories. The two reinforcement memories are decayed or strengthened by stronger stimulus. Thereafter the appraisal state is updated through the competition of positive and negative reinforcement memories. Therefore, RMU can learn the appraisal variation under violent changing of the stimuli for estimating human affective experience. As shown in the experiments of video quality assessment and video quality of experience tasks, the proposed reinforcement memory unit achieves superior performance among recurrent neural networks, that demonstrates the effectiveness of RMU for modeling human cognitive appraisal.      
### 79.Analyzing Deep Learning Based Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing MRI Modalities  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03470.pdf)
>  This technical report presents a comparative analysis of existing deep learning (DL) based approaches for brain tumor segmentation with missing MRI modalities. Approaches evaluated include the Adversarial Co-training Network (ACN) and a combination of mmGAN and DeepMedic. A more stable and easy-to-use version of mmGAN is also open-sourced at a GitHub repository. Using the BraTS2018 dataset, this work demonstrates that the state-of-the-art ACN performs better especially when T1c is missing. While a simple combination of mmGAN and DeepMedic also shows strong potentials when only one MRI modality is missing. Additionally, this work initiated discussions with future research directions for brain tumor segmentation with missing MRI modalities.      
### 80.Class Is Invariant to Context and Vice Versa: On Learning Invariance for Out-Of-Distribution Generalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03462.pdf)
>  Out-Of-Distribution generalization (OOD) is all about learning invariance against environmental changes. If the context in every class is evenly distributed, OOD would be trivial because the context can be easily removed due to an underlying principle: class is invariant to context. However, collecting such a balanced dataset is impractical. Learning on imbalanced data makes the model bias to context and thus hurts OOD. Therefore, the key to OOD is context balance. We argue that the widely adopted assumption in prior work, the context bias can be directly annotated or estimated from biased class prediction, renders the context incomplete or even incorrect. In contrast, we point out the everoverlooked other side of the above principle: context is also invariant to class, which motivates us to consider the classes (which are already labeled) as the varying environments to resolve context bias (without context labels). We implement this idea by minimizing the contrastive loss of intra-class sample similarity while assuring this similarity to be invariant across all classes. On benchmarks with various context biases and domain gaps, we show that a simple re-weighting based classifier equipped with our context estimation achieves state-of-the-art performance. We provide the theoretical justifications in Appendix and codes on <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/simpleshinobu/IRMCon" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 81.AFE-CNN: 3D Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Action Feature Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03444.pdf)
>  Existing 3D skeleton-based action recognition approaches reach impressive performance by encoding handcrafted action features to image format and decoding by CNNs. However, such methods are limited in two ways: a) the handcrafted action features are difficult to handle challenging actions, and b) they generally require complex CNN models to improve action recognition accuracy, which usually occur heavy computational burden. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel AFE-CNN, which devotes to enhance the features of 3D skeleton-based actions to adapt to challenging actions. We propose feature enhance modules from key joint, bone vector, key frame and temporal perspectives, thus the AFE-CNN is more robust to camera views and body sizes variation, and significantly improve the recognition accuracy on challenging actions. Moreover, our AFE-CNN adopts a light-weight CNN model to decode images with action feature enhanced, which ensures a much lower computational burden than the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate the AFE-CNN on three benchmark skeleton-based action datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and UTKinect-Action3D, with extensive experimental results demonstrate our outstanding performance of AFE-CNN.      
### 82.Deep Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo via Inter-Intra Image Feature Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03440.pdf)
>  Uncalibrated photometric stereo is proposed to estimate the detailed surface normal from images under varying and unknown lightings. Recently, deep learning brings powerful data priors to this underdetermined problem. This paper presents a new method for deep uncalibrated photometric stereo, which efficiently utilizes the inter-image representation to guide the normal estimation. Previous methods use optimization-based neural inverse rendering or a single size-independent pooling layer to deal with multiple inputs, which are inefficient for utilizing information among input images. Given multi-images under different lighting, we consider the intra-image and inter-image variations highly correlated. Motivated by the correlated variations, we designed an inter-intra image feature fusion module to introduce the inter-image representation into the per-image feature extraction. The extra representation is used to guide the per-image feature extraction and eliminate the ambiguity in normal estimation. We demonstrate the effect of our design on a wide range of samples, especially on dark materials. Our method produces significantly better results than the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real data.      
### 83.Exploring the Effects of Data Augmentation for Drivable Area Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03437.pdf)
>  The real-time segmentation of drivable areas plays a vital role in accomplishing autonomous perception in cars. Recently there have been some rapid strides in the development of image segmentation models using deep learning. However, most of the advancements have been made in model architecture design. In solving any supervised deep learning problem related to segmentation, the success of the model that one builds depends upon the amount and quality of input training data we use for that model. This data should contain well-annotated varied images for better working of the segmentation model. Issues like this pertaining to annotations in a dataset can lead the model to conclude with overwhelming Type I and II errors in testing and validation, causing malicious issues when trying to tackle real world problems. To address this problem and to make our model more accurate, dynamic, and robust, data augmentation comes into usage as it helps in expanding our sample training data and making it better and more diversified overall. Hence, in our study, we focus on investigating the benefits of data augmentation by analyzing pre-existing image datasets and performing augmentations accordingly. Our results show that the performance and robustness of existing state of the art (or SOTA) models can be increased dramatically without any increase in model complexity or inference time. The augmentations decided on and used in this paper were decided only after thorough research of several other augmentation methodologies and strategies and their corresponding effects that are in widespread usage today. All our results are being reported on the widely used Cityscapes Dataset.      
### 84.IVT: An End-to-End Instance-guided Video Transformer for 3D Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03431.pdf)
>  Video 3D human pose estimation aims to localize the 3D coordinates of human joints from videos. Recent transformer-based approaches focus on capturing the spatiotemporal information from sequential 2D poses, which cannot model the contextual depth feature effectively since the visual depth features are lost in the step of 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we simplify the paradigm into an end-to-end framework, Instance-guided Video Transformer (IVT), which enables learning spatiotemporal contextual depth information from visual features effectively and predicts 3D poses directly from video frames. In particular, we firstly formulate video frames as a series of instance-guided tokens and each token is in charge of predicting the 3D pose of a human instance. These tokens contain body structure information since they are extracted by the guidance of joint offsets from the human center to the corresponding body joints. Then, these tokens are sent into IVT for learning spatiotemporal contextual depth. In addition, we propose a cross-scale instance-guided attention mechanism to handle the variational scales among multiple persons. Finally, the 3D poses of each person are decoded from instance-guided tokens by coordinate regression. Experiments on three widely-used 3D pose estimation benchmarks show that the proposed IVT achieves state-of-the-art performances.      
### 85.Multi-view deep learning for reliable post-disaster damage classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03419.pdf)
>  This study aims to enable more reliable automated post-disaster building damage classification using artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-view imagery. The current practices and research efforts in adopting AI for post-disaster damage assessment are generally (a) qualitative, lacking refined classification of building damage levels based on standard damage scales, and (b) trained based on aerial or satellite imagery with limited views, which, although indicative, are not completely descriptive of the damage scale. To enable more accurate and reliable automated quantification of damage levels, the present study proposes the use of more comprehensive visual data in the form of multiple ground and aerial views of the buildings. To have such a spatially-aware damage prediction model, a Multi-view Convolution Neural Network (MV-CNN) architecture is used that combines the information from different views of a damaged building. This spatial 3D context damage information will result in more accurate identification of damages and reliable quantification of damage levels. The proposed model is trained and validated on reconnaissance visual dataset containing expert-labeled, geotagged images of the inspected buildings following hurricane Harvey. The developed model demonstrates reasonably good accuracy in predicting the damage levels and can be used to support more informed and reliable AI-assisted disaster management practices.      
### 86.A novel deep learning-based approach for sleep apnea detection using single-lead ECG signals  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03408.pdf)
>  Sleep apnea (SA) is a type of sleep disorder characterized by snoring and chronic sleeplessness, which can lead to serious conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy (enlargement of the muscle tissue of the heart). The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a critical role in identifying SA since it might reveal abnormal cardiac activity. Recent research on ECG-based SA detection has focused on feature engineering techniques that extract specific characteristics from multiple-lead ECG signals and use them as classification model inputs. In this study, a novel method of feature extraction based on the detection of S peaks is proposed to enhance the detection of adjacent SA segments using a single-lead ECG. In particular, ECG features collected from a single lead (V2) are used to identify SA episodes. On the extracted features, a CNN model is trained to detect SA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method detects SA from single-lead ECG data is more accurate than existing state-of-the-art methods, with 91.13% classification accuracy, 92.58% sensitivity, and 88.75% specificity. Moreover, the further usage of features associated with the S peaks enhances the classification accuracy by 0.85%. Our findings indicate that the proposed machine learning system has the potential to be an effective method for detecting SA episodes.      
### 87.Slice-level Detection of Intracranial Hemorrhage on CT Using Deep Descriptors of Adjacent Slices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03403.pdf)
>  The rapid development in representation learning techniques and the availability of large-scale medical imaging data have to a rapid increase in the use of machine learning in the 3D medical image analysis. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) have been key players and were adopted by the medical imaging community to assist clinicians and medical experts in disease diagnosis. However, training deep neural networks such as D-CNN on high-resolution 3D volumes of Computed Tomography (CT) scans for diagnostic tasks poses formidable computational challenges. This raises the need of developing deep learning-based approaches that are robust in learning representations in 2D images, instead 3D scans. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to train \emph{slice-level} classifiers on CT scans based on the descriptors of the adjacent slices along the axis. In particular, each of which is extracted through a convolutional neural network (CNN). This method is applicable to CT datasets with per-slice labels such as the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) dataset, which aims to predict the presence of ICH and classify it into 5 different sub-types. We obtain a single model in the top 4\% best-performing solutions of the RSNA ICH challenge, where model ensembles are allowed. Experiments also show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline model on CQ500. The proposed method is general and can be applied for other 3D medical diagnosis tasks such as MRI imaging. To encourage new advances in the field, we will make our codes and pre-trained model available upon acceptance of the paper.      
### 88.Keys to Better Image Inpainting: Structure and Texture Go Hand in Hand  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03382.pdf)
>  Deep image inpainting has made impressive progress with recent advances in image generation and processing algorithms. We claim that the performance of inpainting algorithms can be better judged by the generated structures and textures. Structures refer to the generated object boundary or novel geometric structures within the hole, while texture refers to high-frequency details, especially man-made repeating patterns filled inside the structural regions. We believe that better structures are usually obtained from a coarse-to-fine GAN-based generator network while repeating patterns nowadays can be better modeled using state-of-the-art high-frequency fast fourier convolutional layers. In this paper, we propose a novel inpainting network combining the advantages of the two designs. Therefore, our model achieves a remarkable visual quality to match state-of-the-art performance in both structure generation and repeating texture synthesis using a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, and our conclusions further highlight the two critical factors of image inpainting quality, structures, and textures, as the future design directions of inpainting networks.      
### 89.A Survey on Visual Map Localization Using LiDARs and Cameras  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03376.pdf)
>  As the autonomous driving industry is slowly maturing, visual map localization is quickly becoming the standard approach to localize cars as accurately as possible. Owing to the rich data returned by visual sensors such as cameras or LiDARs, researchers are able to build different types of maps with various levels of details, and use them to achieve high levels of vehicle localization accuracy and stability in urban environments. Contrary to the popular SLAM approaches, visual map localization relies on pre-built maps, and is focused solely on improving the localization accuracy by avoiding error accumulation or drift. We define visual map localization as a two-stage process. At the stage of place recognition, the initial position of the vehicle in the map is determined by comparing the visual sensor output with a set of geo-tagged map regions of interest. Subsequently, at the stage of map metric localization, the vehicle is tracked while it moves across the map by continuously aligning the visual sensors' output with the current area of the map that is being traversed. In this paper, we survey, discuss and compare the latest methods for LiDAR based, camera based and cross-modal visual map localization for both stages, in an effort to highlight the strength and weakness of each approach.      
### 90.GLASS: Global to Local Attention for Scene-Text Spotting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03364.pdf)
>  In recent years, the dominant paradigm for text spotting is to combine the tasks of text detection and recognition into a single end-to-end framework. Under this paradigm, both tasks are accomplished by operating over a shared global feature map extracted from the input image. Among the main challenges that end-to-end approaches face is the performance degradation when recognizing text across scale variations (smaller or larger text), and arbitrary word rotation angles. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a novel global-to-local attention mechanism for text spotting, termed GLASS, that fuses together global and local features. The global features are extracted from the shared backbone, preserving contextual information from the entire image, while the local features are computed individually on resized, high-resolution rotated word crops. The information extracted from the local crops alleviates much of the inherent difficulties with scale and word rotation. We show a performance analysis across scales and angles, highlighting improvement over scale and angle extremities. In addition, we introduce an orientation-aware loss term supervising the detection task, and show its contribution to both detection and recognition performance across all angles. Finally, we show that GLASS is general by incorporating it into other leading text spotting architectures, improving their text spotting performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including the newly released TextOCR.      
### 91.Perceptual Artifacts Localization for Inpainting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03357.pdf)
>  Image inpainting is an essential task for multiple practical applications like object removal and image editing. Deep GAN-based models greatly improve the inpainting performance in structures and textures within the hole, but might also generate unexpected artifacts like broken structures or color blobs. Users perceive these artifacts to judge the effectiveness of inpainting models, and retouch these imperfect areas to inpaint again in a typical retouching workflow. Inspired by this workflow, we propose a new learning task of automatic segmentation of inpainting perceptual artifacts, and apply the model for inpainting model evaluation and iterative refinement. Specifically, we first construct a new inpainting artifacts dataset by manually annotating perceptual artifacts in the results of state-of-the-art inpainting models. Then we train advanced segmentation networks on this dataset to reliably localize inpainting artifacts within inpainted images. Second, we propose a new interpretable evaluation metric called Perceptual Artifact Ratio (PAR), which is the ratio of objectionable inpainted regions to the entire inpainted area. PAR demonstrates a strong correlation with real user preference. Finally, we further apply the generated masks for iterative image inpainting by combining our approach with multiple recent inpainting methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent decrease of artifact regions and inpainting quality improvement across the different methods.      
### 92.A Sketch Is Worth a Thousand Words: Image Retrieval with Text and Sketch  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03354.pdf)
>  We address the problem of retrieving images with both a sketch and a text query. We present TASK-former (Text And SKetch transformer), an end-to-end trainable model for image retrieval using a text description and a sketch as input. We argue that both input modalities complement each other in a manner that cannot be achieved easily by either one alone. TASK-former follows the late-fusion dual-encoder approach, similar to CLIP, which allows efficient and scalable retrieval since the retrieval set can be indexed independently of the queries. We empirically demonstrate that using an input sketch (even a poorly drawn one) in addition to text considerably increases retrieval recall compared to traditional text-based image retrieval. To evaluate our approach, we collect 5,000 hand-drawn sketches for images in the test set of the COCO dataset. The collected sketches are available a <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://janesjanes.github.io/tsbir/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 93.Boosting neural video codecs by exploiting hierarchical redundancy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04303.pdf)
>  In video compression, coding efficiency is improved by reusing pixels from previously decoded frames via motion and residual compensation. We define two levels of hierarchical redundancy in video frames: 1) first-order: redundancy in pixel space, i.e., similarities in pixel values across neighboring frames, which is effectively captured using motion and residual compensation, 2) second-order: redundancy in motion and residual maps due to smooth motion in natural videos. While most of the existing neural video coding literature addresses first-order redundancy, we tackle the problem of capturing second-order redundancy in neural video codecs via predictors. We introduce generic motion and residual predictors that learn to extrapolate from previously decoded data. These predictors are lightweight, and can be employed with most neural video codecs in order to improve their rate-distortion performance. Moreover, while RGB is the dominant colorspace in neural video coding literature, we introduce general modifications for neural video codecs to embrace the YUV420 colorspace and report YUV420 results. Our experiments show that using our predictors with a well-known neural video codec leads to 38% and 34% bitrate savings in RGB and YUV420 colorspaces measured on the UVG dataset.      
### 94.Visual-Inertial Multi-Instance Dynamic SLAM with Object-level Relocalisation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04274.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a tightly-coupled visual-inertial object-level multi-instance dynamic SLAM system. Even in extremely dynamic scenes, it can robustly optimise for the camera pose, velocity, IMU biases and build a dense 3D reconstruction object-level map of the environment. Our system can robustly track and reconstruct the geometries of arbitrary objects, their semantics and motion by incrementally fusing associated colour, depth, semantic, and foreground object probabilities into each object model thanks to its robust sensor and object tracking. In addition, when an object is lost or moved outside the camera field of view, our system can reliably recover its pose upon re-observation. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our method by quantitatively and qualitatively testing it in real-world data sequences.      
### 95.Content-Based Landmark Retrieval Combining Global and Local Features using Siamese Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04201.pdf)
>  In this work, we present a method for landmark retrieval that utilizes global and local features. A Siamese network is used for global feature extraction and metric learning, which gives an initial ranking of the landmark search. We utilize the extracted feature maps from the Siamese architecture as local descriptors, the search results are then further refined using a cosine similarity between local descriptors. We conduct a deeper analysis of the Google Landmark Dataset, which is used for evaluation, and augment the dataset to handle various intra-class variances. Furthermore, we conduct several experiments to compare the effects of transfer learning and metric learning, as well as experiments using other local descriptors. We show that a re-ranking using local features can improve the search results. We believe that the proposed local feature extraction using cosine similarity is a simple approach that can be extended to many other retrieval tasks.      
### 96.Object Detection Using Sim2Real Domain Randomization for Robotic Applications  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04171.pdf)
>  Robots working in unstructured environments must be capable of sensing and interpreting their surroundings. One of the main obstacles of deep learning based models in the field of robotics is the lack of domain-specific labeled data for different industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a sim2real transfer learning method based on domain randomization for object detection with which labeled synthetic datasets of arbitrary size and object types can be automatically generated. Subsequently, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, YOLOv4, is trained to detect the different types of industrial objects. With the proposed domain randomization method, we could shrink the reality gap to a satisfactory level, achieving 86.32% and 97.38% mAP50 scores respectively in the case of zero-shot and one-shot transfers, on our manually annotated dataset containing 190 real images. On a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU, the data generation process takes less than 0.5s per image and the training lasts around 12h which makes it convenient for industrial use. Our solution matches industrial needs as it can reliably differentiate similar classes of objects by using only 1 real image for training. To our best knowledge, this is the only work thus far satisfying these constraints.      
### 97.Computer Vision Methods for the Microstructural Analysis of Materials: The State-of-the-art and Future Perspectives  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04149.pdf)
>  Finding quantitative descriptors representing the microstructural features of a given material is an ongoing research area in the paradigm of Materials-by-Design. Historically, microstructural analysis mostly relies on qualitative descriptions. However, to build a robust and accurate process-structure-properties relationship, which is required for designing new advanced high-performance materials, the extraction of quantitative and meaningful statistical data from the microstructural analysis is a critical step. In recent years, computer vision (CV) methods, especially those which are centered around convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms have shown promising results for this purpose. This review paper focuses on the state-of-the-art CNN-based techniques that have been applied to various multi-scale microstructural image analysis tasks, including classification, object detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and reconstruction. Additionally, we identified the main challenges with regard to the application of these methods to materials science research. Finally, we discussed some possible future directions of research in this area. In particular, we emphasized the application of transformer-based models and their capabilities to improve the microstructural analysis of materials.      
### 98.Style Transfer of Black and White Silhouette Images using CycleGAN and a Randomly Generated Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04140.pdf)
>  CycleGAN can be used to transfer an artistic style to an image. It does not require pairs of source and stylized images to train a model. Taking this advantage, we propose using randomly generated data to train a machine learning model that can transfer traditional art style to a black and white silhouette image. The result is noticeably better than the previous neural style transfer methods. However, there are some areas for improvement, such as removing artifacts and spikes from the transformed image.      
### 99.Image Quality Assessment with Gradient Siamese Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04081.pdf)
>  In this work, we introduce Gradient Siamese Network (GSN) for image quality assessment. The proposed method is skilled in capturing the gradient features between distorted images and reference images in full-reference image quality assessment(IQA) task. We utilize Central Differential Convolution to obtain both semantic features and detail difference hidden in image pair. Furthermore, spatial attention guides the network to concentrate on regions related to image detail. For the low-level, mid-level and high-level features extracted by the network, we innovatively design a multi-level fusion method to improve the efficiency of feature utilization. In addition to the common mean square error supervision, we further consider the relative distance among batch samples and successfully apply KL divergence loss to the image quality assessment task. We experimented the proposed algorithm GSN on several publicly available datasets and proved its superior performance. Our network won the second place in NTIRE 2022 Perceptual Image Quality Assessment Challenge track 1 Full-Reference.      
### 100.Stain-Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning for Histopathology Image Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04017.pdf)
>  It is commonly recognized that color variations caused by differences in stains is a critical issue for histopathology image analysis. Existing methods adopt color matching, stain separation, stain transfer or the combination of them to alleviate the stain variation problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Stain-Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning(SASSL) method for histopathology image analysis. Our SASSL integrates a domain-adversarial training module into the SSL framework to learn distinctive features that are robust to both various transformations and stain variations. The proposed SASSL is regarded as a general method for domain-invariant feature extraction which can be flexibly combined with arbitrary downstream histopathology image analysis modules (e.g. nuclei/tissue segmentation) by fine-tuning the features for specific downstream tasks. We conducted experiments on publicly available pathological image analysis datasets including the PANDA, BreastPathQ, and CAMELYON16 datasets, achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can robustly improve the feature extraction ability of the model, and achieve stable performance improvement in downstream tasks.      
### 101.Ensembled Autoencoder Regularization for Multi-Structure Segmentation for Kidney Cancer Treatment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04007.pdf)
>  The kidney cancer is one of the most common cancer types. The treatment frequently include surgical intervention. However, surgery is in this case particularly challenging due to regional anatomical relations. Organ delineation can significantly improve surgical planning and execution. In this contribution, we propose ensemble of two fully convolutional networks for segmentation of kidney, tumor, veins and arteries. While SegResNet architecture achieved better performance on tumor, the nnU-Net provided more precise segmentation for kidneys, arteries and veins. So in our proposed approach we combine these two networks, and further boost the performance by mixup augmentation.      
### 102.All-optical image classification through unknown random diffusers using a single-pixel diffractive network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03968.pdf)
>  Classification of an object behind a random and unknown scattering medium sets a challenging task for computational imaging and machine vision fields. Recent deep learning-based approaches demonstrated the classification of objects using diffuser-distorted patterns collected by an image sensor. These methods demand relatively large-scale computing using deep neural networks running on digital computers. Here, we present an all-optical processor to directly classify unknown objects through unknown, random phase diffusers using broadband illumination detected with a single pixel. A set of transmissive diffractive layers, optimized using deep learning, forms a physical network that all-optically maps the spatial information of an input object behind a random diffuser into the power spectrum of the output light detected through a single pixel at the output plane of the diffractive network. We numerically demonstrated the accuracy of this framework using broadband radiation to classify unknown handwritten digits through random new diffusers, never used during the training phase, and achieved a blind testing accuracy of 88.53%. This single-pixel all-optical object classification system through random diffusers is based on passive diffractive layers that process broadband input light and can operate at any part of the electromagnetic spectrum by simply scaling the diffractive features proportional to the wavelength range of interest. These results have various potential applications in, e.g., biomedical imaging, security, robotics, and autonomous driving.      
### 103.NPB-REC: Non-parametric Assessment of Uncertainty in Deep-learning-based MRI Reconstruction from Undersampled Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03966.pdf)
>  Uncertainty quantification in deep-learning (DL) based image reconstruction models is critical for reliable clinical decision making based on the reconstructed images. We introduce "NPB-REC", a non-parametric fully Bayesian framework for uncertainty assessment in MRI reconstruction from undersampled "k-space" data. We use Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) during the training phase to characterize the posterior distribution of the network weights. We demonstrated the added-value of our approach on the multi-coil brain MRI dataset, from the fastmri challenge, in comparison to the baseline E2E-VarNet with and without inference-time dropout. Our experiments show that NPB-REC outperforms the baseline by means of reconstruction accuracy (PSNR and SSIM of $34.55$, $0.908$ vs. $33.08$, $0.897$, $p&lt;0.01$) in high acceleration rates ($R=8$). This is also measured in regions of clinical annotations. More significantly, it provides a more accurate estimate of the uncertainty that correlates with the reconstruction error, compared to the Monte-Carlo inference time Dropout method (Pearson correlation coefficient of $R=0.94$ vs. $R=0.91$). The proposed approach has the potential to facilitate safe utilization of DL based methods for MRI reconstruction from undersampled data.

### 104.Inflating 2D Convolution Weights for Efficient Generation of 3D Medical Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03934.pdf)
>  The generation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images can have great application potential since it takes into account the 3D anatomical structure. There are two problems, however, that prevent effective training of a 3D medical generative model: (1) 3D medical images are very expensive to acquire and annotate, resulting in an insufficient number of training images, (2) a large number of parameters are involved in 3D convolution. To address both problems, we propose a novel GAN model called 3D Split&amp;Shuffle-GAN. In order to address the 3D data scarcity issue, we first pre-train a two-dimensional (2D) GAN model using abundant image slices and inflate the 2D convolution weights to improve initialization of the 3D GAN. Novel 3D network architectures are proposed for both the generator and discriminator of the GAN model to significantly reduce the number of parameters while maintaining the quality of image generation. A number of weight inflation strategies and parameter-efficient 3D architectures are investigated. Experiments on both heart (Stanford AIMI Coronary Calcium) and brain (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to improved 3D images generation quality with significantly fewer parameters.      
### 105.Adversarial robustness of $β-$VAE through the lens of local geometry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03923.pdf)
>  Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks. An adversary can find a small perturbation in the input sample to change its latent encoding non-smoothly, thereby compromising the reconstruction. A known reason for such vulnerability is the latent space distortions arising from a mismatch between approximated latent posterior and a prior distribution. Consequently, a slight change in the inputs leads to a significant change in the latent space encodings. This paper demonstrates that the sensitivity around a data point is due to a directional bias of a stochastic pullback metric tensor induced by the encoder network. The pullback metric tensor measures the infinitesimal volume change from input to latent space. Thus, it can be viewed as a lens to analyse the effect of small changes in the input leading to distortions in the latent space. We propose robustness evaluation scores using the eigenspectrum of a pullback metric. Moreover, we empirically show that the scores correlate with the robustness parameter $\beta$ of the $\beta-$VAE.      
### 106.SelfCoLearn: Self-supervised collaborative learning for accelerating dynamic MR imaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03904.pdf)
>  Lately, deep learning has been extensively investigated for accelerating dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, with encouraging progresses achieved. However, without fully sampled reference data for training, current approaches may have limited abilities in recovering fine details or structures. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a self-supervised collaborative learning framework (SelfCoLearn) for accurate dynamic MR image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. The proposed framework is equipped with three important components, namely, dual-network collaborative learning, reunderampling data augmentation and a specially designed co-training loss. The framework is flexible to be integrated with both data-driven networks and model-based iterative un-rolled networks. Our method has been evaluated on in-vivo dataset and compared it to four state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our method possesses strong capabilities in capturing essential and inherent representations for direct reconstructions from the undersampled k-space data and thus enables high-quality and fast dynamic MR imaging.      
### 107.Data-centric AI approach to improve optic nerve head segmentation and localization in OCT en face images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03868.pdf)
>  The automatic detection and localization of anatomical features in retinal imaging data are relevant for many aspects. In this work, we follow a data-centric approach to optimize classifier training for optic nerve head detection and localization in optical coherence tomography en face images of the retina. We examine the effect of domain knowledge driven spatial complexity reduction on the resulting optic nerve head segmentation and localization performance. We present a machine learning approach for segmenting optic nerve head in 2D en face projections of 3D widefield swept source optical coherence tomography scans that enables the automated assessment of large amounts of data. Evaluation on manually annotated 2D en face images of the retina demonstrates that training of a standard U-Net can yield improved optic nerve head segmentation and localization performance when the underlying pixel-level binary classification task is spatially relaxed through domain knowledge.      
### 108.Distributed Contrastive Learning for Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03808.pdf)
>  Supervised deep learning needs a large amount of labeled data to achieve high performance. However, in medical imaging analysis, each site may only have a limited amount of data and labels, which makes learning ineffective. Federated learning (FL) can learn a shared model from decentralized data. But traditional FL requires fully-labeled data for training, which is very expensive to obtain. Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) can learn from unlabeled data for pre-training, followed by fine-tuning with limited annotations. However, when adopting CL in FL, the limited data diversity on each site makes federated contrastive learning (FCL) ineffective. In this work, we propose two federated self-supervised learning frameworks for volumetric medical image segmentation with limited annotations. The first one features high accuracy and fits high-performance servers with high-speed connections. The second one features lower communication costs, suitable for mobile devices. In the first framework, features are exchanged during FCL to provide diverse contrastive data to each site for effective local CL while keeping raw data private. Global structural matching aligns local and remote features for a unified feature space among different sites. In the second framework, to reduce the communication cost for feature exchanging, we propose an optimized method FCLOpt that does not rely on negative samples. To reduce the communications of model download, we propose the predictive target network update (PTNU) that predicts the parameters of the target network. Based on PTNU, we propose the distance prediction (DP) to remove most of the uploads of the target network. Experiments on a cardiac MRI dataset show the proposed two frameworks substantially improve the segmentation and generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art techniques.      
### 109.Exploring Long &amp; Short Range Temporal Information for Learned Video Compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03754.pdf)
>  Learned video compression methods have gained a variety of interest in the video coding community since they have matched or even exceeded the rate-distortion (RD) performance of traditional video codecs. However, many current learning-based methods are dedicated to utilizing short-range temporal information, thus limiting their performance. In this paper, we focus on exploiting the unique characteristics of video content and further exploring temporal information to enhance compression performance. Specifically, for long-range temporal information exploitation, we propose temporal prior that can update continuously within the group of pictures (GOP) during inference. In that case temporal prior contains valuable temporal information of all decoded images within the current GOP. As for short-range temporal information, we propose a progressive guided motion compensation to achieve robust and effective compensation. In detail, we design a hierarchical structure to achieve multi-scale compensation. More importantly, we use optical flow guidance to generate pixel offsets between feature maps at each scale, and the compensation results at each scale will be used to guide the following scale's compensation. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that our method can obtain better RD performance than state-of-the-art video compression approaches.

### 110.Image denoising in acoustic field microscopy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03688.pdf)
>  Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) has been employed since microscopic images are widely used for biomedical or materials research. Acoustic imaging is an important and well-established method used in nondestructive testing (NDT), bio-medical imaging, and structural health monitoring.The imaging is frequently carried out with signals of low amplitude, which might result in leading that are noisy and lacking in details of image information. In this work, we attempted to analyze SAM images acquired from low amplitude signals and employed a block matching filter over time domain signals to obtain a denoised image. We have compared the images with conventional filters applied over time domain signals, such as the gaussian filter, median filter, wiener filter, and total variation filter. The noted outcomes are shown in this article.      
### 111.See What You See: Self-supervised Cross-modal Retrieval of Visual Stimuli from Brain Activity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03666.pdf)
>  Recent studies demonstrate the use of a two-stage supervised framework to generate images that depict human perception to visual stimuli from EEG, referring to EEG-visual reconstruction. They are, however, unable to reproduce the exact visual stimulus, since it is the human-specified annotation of images, not their data, that determines what the synthesized images are. Moreover, synthesized images often suffer from noisy EEG encodings and unstable training of generative models, making them hard to recognize. Instead, we present a single-stage EEG-visual retrieval paradigm where data of two modalities are correlated, as opposed to their annotations, allowing us to recover the exact visual stimulus for an EEG clip. We maximize the mutual information between the EEG encoding and associated visual stimulus through optimization of a contrastive self-supervised objective, leading to two additional benefits. One, it enables EEG encodings to handle visual classes beyond seen ones during training, since learning is not directed at class annotations. In addition, the model is no longer required to generate every detail of the visual stimulus, but rather focuses on cross-modal alignment and retrieves images at the instance level, ensuring distinguishable model output. Empirical studies are conducted on the largest single-subject EEG dataset that measures brain activities evoked by image stimuli. We demonstrate the proposed approach completes an instance-level EEG-visual retrieval task which existing methods cannot. We also examine the implications of a range of EEG and visual encoder structures. Furthermore, for a mostly studied semantic-level EEG-visual classification task, despite not using class annotations, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised EEG-visual reconstruction approaches, particularly on the capability of open class recognition.      
### 112.Improved Point Estimation for the Rayleigh Regression Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03611.pdf)
>  The Rayleigh regression model was recently proposed for modeling amplitude values of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image pixels. However, inferences from such model are based on the maximum likelihood estimators, which can be biased for small signal lengths. The Rayleigh regression model for SAR images often takes into account small pixel windows, which may lead to inaccurate results. In this letter, we introduce bias-adjusted estimators tailored for the Rayleigh regression model based on: (i) the Cox and Snell's method; (ii) the Firth's scheme; and (iii) the parametric bootstrap method. We present numerical experiments considering synthetic and actual SAR data sets. The bias-adjusted estimators yield nearly unbiased estimates and accurate modeling results.      
### 113.Blackbox Attacks via Surrogate Ensemble Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03610.pdf)
>  Blackbox adversarial attacks can be categorized into transfer- and query-based attacks. Transfer methods do not require any feedback from the victim model, but provide lower success rates compared to query-based methods. Query attacks often require a large number of queries for success. To achieve the best of both approaches, recent efforts have tried to combine them, but still require hundreds of queries to achieve high success rates (especially for targeted attacks). In this paper, we propose a novel method for blackbox attacks via surrogate ensemble search (BASES) that can generate highly successful blackbox attacks using an extremely small number of queries. We first define a perturbation machine that generates a perturbed image by minimizing a weighted loss function over a fixed set of surrogate models. To generate an attack for a given victim model, we search over the weights in the loss function using queries generated by the perturbation machine. Since the dimension of the search space is small (same as the number of surrogate models), the search requires a small number of queries. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better success rate with at least 30x fewer queries compared to state-of-the-art methods on different image classifiers trained with ImageNet (including VGG-19, DenseNet-121, and ResNext-50). In particular, our method requires as few as 3 queries per image (on average) to achieve more than a 90% success rate for targeted attacks and 1-2 queries per image for over a 99% success rate for non-targeted attacks. Our method is also effective on Google Cloud Vision API and achieved a 91% non-targeted attack success rate with 2.9 queries per image. We also show that the perturbations generated by our proposed method are highly transferable and can be adopted for hard-label blackbox attacks.      
### 114.Continual Learning for Tumor Classification in Histopathology Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03609.pdf)
>  Recent years have seen great advancements in the development of deep learning models for histopathology image analysis in digital pathology applications, evidenced by the increasingly common deployment of these models in both research and clinical settings. Although such models have shown unprecedented performance in solving fundamental computational tasks in DP applications, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapted to unseen data with transfer learning. With an increasing need for deep learning models to handle ever changing data distributions, including evolving patient population and new diagnosis assays, continual learning models that alleviate model forgetting need to be introduced in DP based analysis. However, to our best knowledge, there is no systematic study of such models for DP-specific applications. Here, we propose CL scenarios in DP settings, where histopathology image data from different sources/distributions arrive sequentially, the knowledge of which is integrated into a single model without training all the data from scratch. We then established an augmented dataset for colorectal cancer H&amp;E classification to simulate shifts of image appearance and evaluated CL model performance in the proposed CL scenarios. We leveraged a breast tumor H&amp;E dataset along with the colorectal cancer to evaluate CL from different tumor types. In addition, we evaluated CL methods in an online few-shot setting under the constraints of annotation and computational resources. We revealed promising results of CL in DP applications, potentially paving the way for application of these methods in clinical practice.      
### 115.Constrained self-supervised method with temporal ensembling for fiber bundle detection on anatomic tracing data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03569.pdf)
>  Anatomic tracing data provides detailed information on brain circuitry essential for addressing some of the common errors in diffusion MRI tractography. However, automated detection of fiber bundles on tracing data is challenging due to sectioning distortions, presence of noise and artifacts and intensity/contrast variations. In this work, we propose a deep learning method with a self-supervised loss function that takes anatomy-based constraints into account for accurate segmentation of fiber bundles on the tracer sections from macaque brains. Also, given the limited availability of manual labels, we use a semi-supervised training technique for efficiently using unlabeled data to improve the performance, and location constraints for further reduction of false positives. Evaluation of our method on unseen sections from a different macaque yields promising results with a true positive rate of ~0.90.

### 116.An Adaptive and Altruistic PSO-based Deep Feature Selection Method for Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03558.pdf)
>  Pneumonia is one of the major reasons for child mortality especially in income-deprived regions of the world. Although it can be detected and treated with very less sophisticated instruments and medication, Pneumonia detection still remains a major concern in developing countries. Computer-aided based diagnosis (CAD) systems can be used in such countries due to their lower operating costs than professional medical experts. In this paper, we propose a CAD system for Pneumonia detection from Chest X-rays, using the concepts of deep learning and a meta-heuristic algorithm. We first extract deep features from the pre-trained ResNet50, fine-tuned on a target Pneumonia dataset. Then, we propose a feature selection technique based on particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is modified using a memory-based adaptation parameter, and enriched by incorporating an altruistic behavior into the agents. We name our feature selection method as adaptive and altruistic PSO (AAPSO). The proposed method successfully eliminates non-informative features obtained from the ResNet50 model, thereby improving the Pneumonia detection ability of the overall framework. Extensive experimentation and thorough analysis on a publicly available Pneumonia dataset establish the superiority of the proposed method over several other frameworks used for Pneumonia detection. Apart from Pneumonia detection, AAPSO is further evaluated on some standard UCI datasets, gene expression datasets for cancer prediction and a COVID-19 prediction dataset. The overall results are satisfactory, thereby confirming the usefulness of AAPSO in dealing with varied real-life problems.

### 117.An Accurate and Explainable Deep Learning System Improves Interobserver Agreement in the Interpretation of Chest Radiograph  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03545.pdf)
>  Recent artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have achieved radiologist-level performance on various medical classification tasks. However, only a few studies addressed the localization of abnormal findings from CXR scans, which is essential in explaining the image-level classification to radiologists. We introduce in this paper an explainable deep learning system called VinDr-CXR that can classify a CXR scan into multiple thoracic diseases and, at the same time, localize most types of critical findings on the image. VinDr-CXR was trained on 51,485 CXR scans with radiologist-provided bounding box annotations. It demonstrated a comparable performance to experienced radiologists in classifying 6 common thoracic diseases on a retrospective validation set of 3,000 CXR scans, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.967 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.958-0.975). The VinDr-CXR was also externally validated in independent patient cohorts and showed its robustness. For the localization task with 14 types of lesions, our free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis showed that the VinDr-CXR achieved a sensitivity of 80.2% at the rate of 1.0 false-positive lesion identified per scan. A prospective study was also conducted to measure the clinical impact of the VinDr-CXR in assisting six experienced radiologists. The results indicated that the proposed system, when used as a diagnosis supporting tool, significantly improved the agreement between radiologists themselves with an increase of 1.5% in mean Fleiss' Kappa. We also observed that, after the radiologists consulted VinDr-CXR's suggestions, the agreement between each of them and the system was remarkably increased by 3.3% in mean Cohen's Kappa.      
### 118.Deep Learning-enabled Spatial Phase Unwrapping for 3D Measurement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03524.pdf)
>  In terms of 3D imaging speed and system cost, the single-camera system projecting single-frequency patterns is the ideal option among all proposed Fringe Projection Profilometry (FPP) systems. This system necessitates a robust spatial phase unwrapping (SPU) algorithm. However, robust SPU remains a challenge in complex scenes. Quality-guided SPU algorithms need more efficient ways to identify the unreliable points in phase maps before unwrapping. End-to-end deep learning SPU methods face generality and interpretability problems. This paper proposes a hybrid method combining deep learning and traditional path-following for robust SPU in FPP. This hybrid SPU scheme demonstrates better robustness than traditional quality-guided SPU methods, better interpretability than end-to-end deep learning scheme, and generality on unseen data. Experiments on the real dataset of multiple illumination conditions and multiple FPP systems differing in image resolution, the number of fringes, fringe direction, and optics wavelength verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.      
### 119.Federated Learning for Medical Applications: A Taxonomy, Current Trends, and Research Challenges  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03392.pdf)
>  With the advent of the IoT, AI, and ML/DL algorithms, the data-driven medical application has emerged as a promising tool for designing reliable and scalable diagnostic and prognostic models from medical data. This has attracted a great deal of attention from academia to industry in recent years. This has undoubtedly improved the quality of healthcare delivery. However, these AI-based medical applications still have poor adoption due to their difficulties in satisfying strict security, privacy, and quality of service standards (such as low latency). Moreover, medical data are usually fragmented and private, making it challenging to generate robust results across populations. Recent developments in federated learning (FL) have made it possible to train complex machine-learned models in a distributed manner. Thus, FL has become an active research domain, particularly processing the medical data at the edge of the network in a decentralized way to preserve privacy and security concerns. To this end, this survey paper highlights the current and future of FL technology in medical applications where data sharing is a significant burden. It also review and discuss the current research trends and their outcomes for designing reliable and scalable FL models. We outline the general FL's statistical problems, device challenges, security, privacy concerns, and its potential in the medical domain. Moreover, our study is also focused on medical applications where we highlight the burden of global cancer and the efficient use of FL for the development of computer-aided diagnosis tools for addressing them. We hope that this review serves as a checkpoint that sets forth the existing state-of-the-art works in a thorough manner and offers open problems and future research directions for this field.      
### 120.Seamless Iterative Semi-Supervised Correction of Imperfect Labels in Microscopy Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03327.pdf)
>  In-vitro tests are an alternative to animal testing for the toxicity of medical devices. Detecting cells as a first step, a cell expert evaluates the growth of cells according to cytotoxicity grade under the microscope. Thus, human fatigue plays a role in error making, making the use of deep learning appealing. Due to the high cost of training data annotation, an approach without manual annotation is needed. We propose Seamless Iterative Semi-Supervised correction of Imperfect labels (SISSI), a new method for training object detection models with noisy and missing annotations in a semi-supervised fashion. Our network learns from noisy labels generated with simple image processing algorithms, which are iteratively corrected during self-training. Due to the nature of missing bounding boxes in the pseudo labels, which would negatively affect the training, we propose to train on dynamically generated synthetic-like images using seamless cloning. Our method successfully provides an adaptive early learning correction technique for object detection. The combination of early learning correction that has been applied in classification and semantic segmentation before and synthetic-like image generation proves to be more effective than the usual semi-supervised approach by &gt; 15% AP and &gt; 20% AR across three different readers.

### 121.Perception-Distortion Balanced ADMM Optimization for Single-Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03324.pdf)
>  In image super-resolution, both pixel-wise accuracy and perceptual fidelity are desirable. However, most deep learning methods only achieve high performance in one aspect due to the perception-distortion trade-off, and works that successfully balance the trade-off rely on fusing results from separately trained models with ad-hoc post-processing. In this paper, we propose a novel super-resolution model with a low-frequency constraint (LFc-SR), which balances the objective and perceptual quality through a single model and yields super-resolved images with high PSNR and perceptual scores. We further introduce an ADMM-based alternating optimization method for the non-trivial learning of the constrained model. Experiments showed that our method, without cumbersome post-processing procedures, achieved the state-of-the-art performance.

### 122.DeepWSD: Projecting Degradations in Perceptual Space to Wasserstein Distance in Deep Feature Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03323.pdf)
>  Existing deep learning-based full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) models usually predict the image quality in a deterministic way by explicitly comparing the features, gauging how severely distorted an image is by how far the corresponding feature lies from the space of the reference images. Herein, we look at this problem from a different viewpoint and propose to model the quality degradation in perceptual space from a statistical distribution perspective. As such, the quality is measured based upon the Wasserstein distance in the deep feature domain. More specifically, the 1DWasserstein distance at each stage of the pre-trained VGG network is measured, based on which the final quality score is performed. The deep Wasserstein distance (DeepWSD) performed on features from neural networks enjoys better interpretability of the quality contamination caused by various types of distortions and presents an advanced quality prediction capability. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis show the superiority of the proposed DeepWSD in terms of both quality prediction and optimization.      
### 123.HPO: We won't get fooled again  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03320.pdf)
>  Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a well-studied research field. However, the effects and interactions of the components in an HPO pipeline are not yet well investigated. Then, we ask ourselves: can the landscape of HPO be biased by the pipeline used to evaluate individual configurations? To address this question, we proposed to analyze the effect of the HPO pipeline on HPO problems using fitness landscape analysis. Particularly, we studied the DS-2019 HPO benchmark data set, looking for patterns that could indicate evaluation pipeline malfunction, and relate them to HPO performance. Our main findings are: (i) In most instances, large groups of diverse hyperparameters (i.e., multiple configurations) yield the same ill performance, most likely associated with majority class prediction models; (ii) in these cases, a worsened correlation between the observed fitness and average fitness in the neighborhood is observed, potentially making harder the deployment of local-search based HPO strategies. Finally, we concluded that the HPO pipeline definition might negatively affect the HPO landscape.      
### 124.Underwater enhancement based on a self-learning strategy and attention mechanism for high-intensity regions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03319.pdf)
>  Images acquired during underwater activities suffer from environmental properties of the water, such as turbidity and light attenuation. These phenomena cause color distortion, blurring, and contrast reduction. In addition, irregular ambient light distribution causes color channel unbalance and regions with high-intensity pixels. Recent works related to underwater image enhancement, and based on deep learning approaches, tackle the lack of paired datasets generating synthetic ground-truth. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning methodology for underwater image enhancement based on deep learning that requires no paired datasets. The proposed method estimates the degradation present in underwater images. Besides, an autoencoder reconstructs this image, and its output image is degraded using the estimated degradation information. Therefore, the strategy replaces the output image with the degraded version in the loss function during the training phase. This procedure \textit{misleads} the neural network that learns to compensate the additional degradation. As a result, the reconstructed image is an enhanced version of the input image. Also, the algorithm presents an attention module to reduce high-intensity areas generated in enhanced images by color channel unbalances and outlier regions. Furthermore, the proposed methodology requires no ground-truth. Besides, only real underwater images were used to train the neural network, and the results indicate the effectiveness of the method in terms of color preservation, color cast reduction, and contrast improvement.      
### 125.Image Quality Assessment: Learning to Rank Image Distortion Level  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03317.pdf)
>  Over the years, various algorithms were developed, attempting to imitate the Human Visual System (HVS), and evaluate the perceptual image quality. However, for certain image distortions, the functionality of the HVS continues to be an enigma, and echoing its behavior remains a challenge (especially for ill-defined distortions). In this paper, we learn to compare the image quality of two registered images, with respect to a chosen distortion. Our method takes advantage of the fact that at times, simulating image distortion and later evaluating its relative image quality, is easier than assessing its absolute value. Thus, given a pair of images, we look for an optimal dimensional reduction function that will map each image to a numerical score, so that the scores will reflect the image quality relation (i.e., a less distorted image will receive a lower score). We look for an optimal dimensional reduction mapping in the form of a Deep Neural Network which minimizes the violation of image quality order. Subsequently, we extend the method to order a set of images by utilizing the predicted level of the chosen distortion. We demonstrate the validity of our method on Latent Chromatic Aberration and Moire distortions, on synthetic and real datasets.
