### 1.Introspective Deep Metric Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04449.pdf)
>  This paper proposes an introspective deep metric learning (IDML) framework for uncertainty-aware comparisons of images. Conventional deep metric learning methods produce confident semantic distances between images regardless of the uncertainty level. However, we argue that a good similarity model should consider the semantic discrepancies with caution to better deal with ambiguous images for more robust training. To achieve this, we propose to represent an image using not only a semantic embedding but also an accompanying uncertainty embedding, which describes the semantic characteristics and ambiguity of an image, respectively. We further propose an introspective similarity metric to make similarity judgments between images considering both their semantic differences and ambiguities. Our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the widely used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets for image retrieval. We further evaluate our framework for image classification on the ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, which shows that equipping existing data mixing methods with the proposed introspective metric consistently achieves better results (e.g., +0.44 for CutMix on ImageNet-1K).

### 2.MixAugment &amp; Mixup: Augmentation Methods for Facial Expression Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04442.pdf)
>  Automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has attracted increasing attention in the last 20 years since facial expressions play a central role in human communication. Most FER methodologies utilize Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that are powerful tools when it comes to data analysis. However, despite their power, these networks are prone to overfitting, as they often tend to memorize the training data. What is more, there are not currently a lot of in-the-wild (i.e. in unconstrained environment) large databases for FER. To alleviate this issue, a number of data augmentation techniques have been proposed. Data augmentation is a way to increase the diversity of available data by applying constrained transformations on the original data. One such technique, which has positively contributed to various classification tasks, is Mixup. According to this, a DNN is trained on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their corresponding labels. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of Mixup for in-the-wild FER in which data have large variations in head poses, illumination conditions, backgrounds and contexts. We then propose a new data augmentation strategy which is based on Mixup, called MixAugment. According to this, the network is trained concurrently on a combination of virtual examples and real examples; all these examples contribute to the overall loss function. We conduct an extensive experimental study that proves the effectiveness of MixAugment over Mixup and various state-of-the-art methods. We further investigate the combination of dropout with Mixup and MixAugment, as well as the combination of other data augmentation techniques with MixAugment.      
### 3.Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Person Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04383.pdf)
>  Unsupervised domain adaptation for person re-identification (Person Re-ID) is the task of transferring the learned knowledge on the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Most of the recent papers that address this problem adopt an offline training setting. More precisely, the training of the Re-ID model is done assuming that we have access to the complete training target domain data set. In this paper, we argue that the target domain generally consists of a stream of data in a practical real-world application, where data is continuously increasing from the different network's cameras. The Re-ID solutions are also constrained by confidentiality regulations stating that the collected data can be stored for only a limited period, hence the model can no longer get access to previously seen target images. Therefore, we present a new yet practical online setting for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for person Re-ID with two main constraints: Online Adaptation and Privacy Protection. We then adapt and evaluate the state-of-the-art UDA algorithms on this new online setting using the well-known Market-1501, Duke, and MSMT17 benchmarks.      
### 4.Beyond a Pre-Trained Object Detector: Cross-Modal Textual and Visual Context for Image Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04363.pdf)
>  Significant progress has been made on visual captioning, largely relying on pre-trained features and later fixed object detectors that serve as rich inputs to auto-regressive models. A key limitation of such methods, however, is that the output of the model is conditioned only on the object detector's outputs. The assumption that such outputs can represent all necessary information is unrealistic, especially when the detector is transferred across datasets. In this work, we reason about the graphical model induced by this assumption, and propose to add an auxiliary input to represent missing information such as object relationships. We specifically propose to mine attributes and relationships from the Visual Genome dataset and condition the captioning model on them. Crucially, we propose (and show to be important) the use of a multi-modal pre-trained model (CLIP) to retrieve such contextual descriptions. Further, object detector models are frozen and do not have sufficient richness to allow the captioning model to properly ground them. As a result, we propose to condition both the detector and description outputs on the image, and show qualitatively and quantitatively that this can improve grounding. We validate our method on image captioning, perform thorough analyses of each component and importance of the pre-trained multi-modal model, and demonstrate significant improvements over the current state of the art, specifically +7.5% in CIDEr and +1.3% in BLEU-4 metrics.      
### 5.A Novel Augmented Reality Ultrasound Framework Using an RGB-D Camera and a 3D-printed Marker  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04350.pdf)
>  Purpose. Ability to locate and track ultrasound images in the 3D operating space is of great benefit for multiple clinical applications. This is often accomplished by tracking the probe using a precise but expensive optical or electromagnetic tracking system. Our goal is to develop a simple and low cost augmented reality echography framework using a standard RGB-D Camera. <br>Methods. A prototype system consisting of an Occipital Structure Core RGB-D camera, a specifically-designed 3D marker, and a fast point cloud registration algorithm FaVoR was developed and evaluated on an Ultrasonix ultrasound system. The probe was calibrated on a 3D-printed N-wire phantom using the software PLUS toolkit. The proposed calibration method is simplified, requiring no additional markers or sensors attached to the phantom. Also, a visualization software based on OpenGL was developed for the augmented reality application. <br>Results. The calibrated probe was used to augment a real-world video in a simulated needle insertion scenario. The ultrasound images were rendered on the video, and visually-coherent results were observed. We evaluated the end-to-end accuracy of our AR US framework on localizing a cube of 5 cm size. From our two experiments, the target pose localization error ranges from 5.6 to 5.9 mm and from -3.9 to 4.2 degrees. <br>Conclusion. We believe that with the potential democratization of RGB-D cameras integrated in mobile devices and AR glasses in the future, our prototype solution may facilitate the use of 3D freehand ultrasound in clinical routine. Future work should include a more rigorous and thorough evaluation, by comparing the calibration accuracy with those obtained by commercial tracking solutions in both simulated and real medical scenarios.      
### 6.Object Detection with Spiking Neural Networks on Automotive Event Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04339.pdf)
>  Automotive embedded algorithms have very high constraints in terms of latency, accuracy and power consumption. In this work, we propose to train spiking neural networks (SNNs) directly on data coming from event cameras to design fast and efficient automotive embedded applications. Indeed, SNNs are more biologically realistic neural networks where neurons communicate using discrete and asynchronous spikes, a naturally energy-efficient and hardware friendly operating mode. Event data, which are binary and sparse in space and time, are therefore the ideal input for spiking neural networks. But to date, their performance was insufficient for automotive real-world problems, such as detecting complex objects in an uncontrolled environment. To address this issue, we took advantage of the latest advancements in matter of spike backpropagation - surrogate gradient learning, parametric LIF, SpikingJelly framework - and of our new \textit{voxel cube} event encoding to train 4 different SNNs based on popular deep learning networks: SqueezeNet, VGG, MobileNet, and DenseNet. As a result, we managed to increase the size and the complexity of SNNs usually considered in the literature. In this paper, we conducted experiments on two automotive event datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art classification results for spiking neural networks. Based on these results, we combined our SNNs with SSD to propose the first spiking neural networks capable of performing object detection on the complex GEN1 Automotive Detection event dataset.      
### 7.Panoptic Neural Fields: A Semantic Object-Aware Neural Scene Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04334.pdf)
>  We present Panoptic Neural Fields (PNF), an object-aware neural scene representation that decomposes a scene into a set of objects (things) and background (stuff). Each object is represented by an oriented 3D bounding box and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes position, direction, and time and outputs density and radiance. The background stuff is represented by a similar MLP that additionally outputs semantic labels. Each object MLPs are instance-specific and thus can be smaller and faster than previous object-aware approaches, while still leveraging category-specific priors incorporated via meta-learned initialization. Our model builds a panoptic radiance field representation of any scene from just color images. We use off-the-shelf algorithms to predict camera poses, object tracks, and 2D image semantic segmentations. Then we jointly optimize the MLP weights and bounding box parameters using analysis-by-synthesis with self-supervision from color images and pseudo-supervision from predicted semantic segmentations. During experiments with real-world dynamic scenes, we find that our model can be used effectively for several tasks like novel view synthesis, 2D panoptic segmentation, 3D scene editing, and multiview depth prediction.      
### 8.HierAttn: Effectively Learn Representations from Stage Attention and Branch Attention for Skin Lesions Diagnosis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04326.pdf)
>  An accurate and unbiased examination of skin lesions is critical for the early diagnosis and treatment of skin cancers. The visual feature of the skin lesions varies significantly because skin images are collected from patients with different skin colours by using various devices. Recent studies have developed ensembled convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify the images for early diagnosis. However, the practical use of CNNs is limited because their network structures are heavyweight and neglect contextual information. Vision transformers (ViTs) learn the global features by self-attention mechanisms, but they also have comparatively large model sizes (more than 100M). To address these limitations, we introduce HierAttn, a lite and effective neural network with hierarchical and self attention. HierAttn applies a novel strategy based on learning local and global features by a multi-stage and hierarchical network. The efficacy of HierAttn was evaluated by using the dermoscopy images dataset ISIC2019 and smartphone photos dataset PAD-UFES-20. The experimental results show that HierAttn achieves the best top-1 accuracy and AUC among state-of-the-art mobile networks, including MobileNetV3 and MobileViT.

### 9.A modular software framework for the design and implementation of ptychography algorithms  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04295.pdf)
>  Computational methods are driving high impact microscopy techniques such as ptychography. However, the design and implementation of new algorithms is often a laborious process, as many parts of the code are written in close-to-the-hardware programming constructs to speed up the reconstruction. In this paper, we present SciComPty, a new ptychography software framework aiming at simulating ptychography datasets and testing state-of-the-art and new reconstruction algorithms. Despite its simplicity, the software leverages GPU accelerated processing through the PyTorch CUDA interface. This is essential to design new methods that can readily be employed. As an example, we present an improved position refinement method based on Adam and a new version of the rPIE algorithm, adapted for partial coherence setups. Results are shown on both synthetic and real datasets. The software is released as open-source.      
### 10.Anatomy-aware Self-supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection in Chest Radiographs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04282.pdf)
>  Large numbers of labeled medical images are essential for the accurate detection of anomalies, but manual annotation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a training method to learn data-specific features without manual annotation. Several SSL-based models have been employed in medical image anomaly detection. These SSL methods effectively learn representations in several field-specific images, such as natural and industrial product images. However, owing to the requirement of medical expertise, typical SSL-based models are inefficient in medical image anomaly detection. We present an SSL-based model that enables anatomical structure-based unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). The model employs the anatomy-aware pasting (AnatPaste) augmentation tool. AnatPaste employs a threshold-based lung segmentation pretext task to create anomalies in normal chest radiographs, which are used for model pretraining. These anomalies are similar to real anomalies and help the model recognize them. We evaluate our model on three opensource chest radiograph datasets. Our model exhibit area under curves (AUC) of 92.1%, 78.7%, and 81.9%, which are the highest among existing UAD models. This is the first SSL model to employ anatomical information as a pretext task. AnatPaste can be applied in various deep learning models and downstream tasks. It can be employed for other modalities by fixing appropriate segmentation.

### 11.Siamese Object Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: A Review and Comprehensive Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04281.pdf)
>  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based visual object tracking has enabled a wide range of applications and attracted increasing attention in the field of remote sensing because of its versatility and effectiveness. As a new force in the revolutionary trend of deep learning, Siamese networks shine in visual object tracking with their promising balance of accuracy, robustness, and speed. Thanks to the development of embedded processors and the gradual optimization of deep neural networks, Siamese trackers receive extensive research and realize preliminary combinations with UAVs. However, due to the UAV's limited onboard computational resources and the complex real-world circumstances, aerial tracking with Siamese networks still faces severe obstacles in many aspects. To further explore the deployment of Siamese networks in UAV tracking, this work presents a comprehensive review of leading-edge Siamese trackers, along with an exhaustive UAV-specific analysis based on the evaluation using a typical UAV onboard processor. Then, the onboard tests are conducted to validate the feasibility and efficacy of representative Siamese trackers in real-world UAV deployment. Furthermore, to better promote the development of the tracking community, this work analyzes the limitations of existing Siamese trackers and conducts additional experiments represented by low-illumination evaluations. In the end, prospects for the development of Siamese UAV tracking in the remote sensing field are discussed. The unified framework of leading-edge Siamese trackers, i.e., code library, and the results of their experimental evaluations are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/vision4robotics/SiameseTracking4UAV" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> .      
### 12.SwinIQA: Learned Swin Distance for Compressed Image Quality Assessment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04264.pdf)
>  Image compression has raised widespread interest recently due to its significant importance for multimedia storage and transmission. Meanwhile, a reliable image quality assessment (IQA) for compressed images can not only help to verify the performance of various compression algorithms but also help to guide the compression optimization in turn. In this paper, we design a full-reference image quality assessment metric SwinIQA to measure the perceptual quality of compressed images in a learned Swin distance space. It is known that the compression artifacts are usually non-uniformly distributed with diverse distortion types and degrees. To warp the compressed images into the shared representation space while maintaining the complex distortion information, we extract the hierarchical feature representations from each stage of the Swin Transformer. Besides, we utilize cross attention operation to map the extracted feature representations into a learned Swin distance space. Experimental results show that the proposed metric achieves higher consistency with human's perceptual judgment compared with both traditional methods and learning-based methods on CLIC datasets.      
### 13.CoCoLoT: Combining Complementary Trackers in Long-Term Visual Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04261.pdf)
>  How to combine the complementary capabilities of an ensemble of different algorithms has been of central interest in visual object tracking. A significant progress on such a problem has been achieved, but considering short-term tracking scenarios. Instead, long-term tracking settings have been substantially ignored by the solutions. In this paper, we explicitly consider long-term tracking scenarios and provide a framework, named CoCoLoT, that combines the characteristics of complementary visual trackers to achieve enhanced long-term tracking performance. CoCoLoT perceives whether the trackers are following the target object through an online learned deep verification model, and accordingly activates a decision policy which selects the best performing tracker as well as it corrects the performance of the failing one. The proposed methodology is evaluated extensively and the comparison with several other solutions reveals that it competes favourably with the state-of-the-art on the most popular long-term visual tracking benchmarks.      
### 14.Improved Evaluation and Generation of Grid Layouts using Distance Preservation Quality and Linear Assignment Sorting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04255.pdf)
>  Images sorted by similarity enables more images to be viewed simultaneously, and can be very useful for stock photo agencies or e-commerce applications. Visually sorted grid layouts attempt to arrange images so that their proximity on the grid corresponds as closely as possible to their similarity. Various metrics exist for evaluating such arrangements, but there is low experimental evidence on correlation between human perceived quality and metric value. We propose Distance Preservation Quality (DPQ) as a new metric to evaluate the quality of an arrangement. Extensive user testing revealed stronger correlation of DPQ with user-perceived quality and performance in image retrieval tasks compared to other metrics. In addition, we introduce Fast Linear Assignment Sorting (FLAS) as a new algorithm for creating visually sorted grid layouts. FLAS achieves very good sorting qualities while improving run time and computational resources.      
### 15.An Effective Scheme for Maize Disease Recognition based on Deep Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04234.pdf)
>  In the last decades, the area under cultivation of maize products has increased because of its essential role in the food cycle for humans, livestock, and poultry. Moreover, the diseases of plants impact food safety and can significantly reduce both the quality and quantity of agricultural products. There are many challenges to accurate and timely diagnosis of the disease. This research presents a novel scheme based on a deep neural network to overcome the mentioned challenges. Due to the limited number of data, the transfer learning technique is employed with the help of two well-known architectures. In this way, a new effective model is adopted by a combination of pre-trained MobileNetV2 and Inception Networks due to their effective performance on object detection problems. The convolution layers of MoblieNetV2 and Inception modules are parallelly arranged as earlier layers to extract crucial features. In addition, the imbalance problem of classes has been solved by an augmentation strategy. The proposed scheme has a superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art models published in recent years. The accuracy of the model reaches 97%, approximately. In summary, experimental results prove the method's validity and significant performance in diagnosing disease in plant leaves.      
### 16.Alternative Data Augmentation for Industrial Monitoring using Adversarial Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04222.pdf)
>  Visual inspection software has become a key factor in the manufacturing industry for quality control and process monitoring. Semantic segmentation models have gained importance since they allow for more precise examination. These models, however, require large image datasets in order to achieve a fair accuracy level. In some cases, training data is sparse or lacks of sufficient annotation, a fact that especially applies to highly specialized production environments. Data augmentation represents a common strategy to extend the dataset. Still, it only varies the image within a narrow range. In this article, a novel strategy is proposed to augment small image datasets. The approach is applied to surface monitoring of carbon fibers, a specific industry use case. We apply two different methods to create binary labels: a problem-tailored trigonometric function and a WGAN model. Afterwards, the labels are translated into color images using pix2pix and used to train a U-Net. The results suggest that the trigonometric function is superior to the WGAN model. However, a precise examination of the resulting images indicate that WGAN and image-to-image translation achieve good segmentation results and only deviate to a small degree from traditional data augmentation. In summary, this study examines an industry application of data synthesization using generative adversarial networks and explores its potential for monitoring systems of production environments. \keywords{Image-to-Image Translation, Carbon Fiber, Data Augmentation, Computer Vision, Industrial Monitoring, Adversarial Learning.      
### 17.Joint learning of object graph and relation graph for visual question answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04188.pdf)
>  Modeling visual question answering(VQA) through scene graphs can significantly improve the reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, existing models answer poorly for complex reasoning questions with attributes or relations, which causes false attribute selection or missing relation in Figure 1(a). It is because these models cannot balance all kinds of information in scene graphs, neglecting relation and attribute information. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dual Message-passing enhanced Graph Neural Network (DM-GNN), which can obtain a balanced representation by properly encoding multi-scale scene graph information. Specifically, we (i)transform the scene graph into two graphs with diversified focuses on objects and relations; Then we design a dual structure to encode them, which increases the weights from relations (ii)fuse the encoder output with attribute features, which increases the weights from attributes; (iii)propose a message-passing mechanism to enhance the information transfer between objects, relations and attributes. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets including GQA, VG, motif-VG and achieve new state of the art.      
### 18.Paired Image-to-Image Translation Quality Assessment Using Multi-Method Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04186.pdf)
>  How best to evaluate synthesized images has been a longstanding problem in image-to-image translation, and to date remains largely unresolved. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines signals of image quality between paired source and transformation to predict the latter's similarity with a hypothetical ground truth. We trained a Multi-Method Fusion (MMF) model via an ensemble of gradient-boosted regressors using Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics to predict Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS), enabling models to be ranked without the need for ground truth data. Analysis revealed the task to be feature-constrained, introducing a trade-off at inference between metric computation time and prediction accuracy. The MMF model we present offers an efficient way to automate the evaluation of synthesized images, and by extension the image-to-image translation models that generated them.      
### 19.Local Prediction Aggregation: A Frustratingly Easy Source-free Domain Adaptation Method  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04183.pdf)
>  We propose a simple but effective source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) method. Treating SFDA as an unsupervised clustering problem and following the intuition that local neighbors in feature space should have more similar predictions than other features, we propose to optimize an objective of prediction consistency. This objective encourages local neighborhood features in feature space to have similar predictions while features farther away in feature space have dissimilar predictions, leading to efficient feature clustering and cluster assignment simultaneously. For efficient training, we seek to optimize an upper-bound of the objective which contains two simple terms. Furthermore, we relate popular existing methods in domain adaptation, source-free domain adaptation and contrastive learning via the perspective of discriminability and diversity. The experimental results prove the superiority of our method, and our method can be adopted as a simple but strong baseline for future research in SFDA.

### 20.Improved-Flow Warp Module for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04160.pdf)
>  Remote sensing semantic segmentation aims to assign automatically each pixel on aerial images with specific label. In this letter, we proposed a new module, called improved-flow warp module (IFWM), to adjust semantic feature maps across different scales for remote sensing semantic segmentation. The improved-flow warp module is applied along with the feature extraction process in the convolutional neural network. First, IFWM computes the offsets of pixels by a learnable way, which can alleviate the misalignment of the multi-scale features. Second, the offsets help with the low-resolution deep feature up-sampling process to improve the feature accordance, which boosts the accuracy of semantic segmentation. We validate our method on several remote sensing datasets, and the results prove the effectiveness of our method..      
### 21.Scaling up sign spotting through sign language dictionaries  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04152.pdf)
>  The focus of this work is $\textit{sign spotting}$ - given a video of an isolated sign, our task is to identify $\textit{whether}$ and $\textit{where}$ it has been signed in a continuous, co-articulated sign language video. To achieve this sign spotting task, we train a model using multiple types of available supervision by: (1) $\textit{watching}$ existing footage which is sparsely labelled using mouthing cues; (2) $\textit{reading}$ associated subtitles (readily available translations of the signed content) which provide additional $\textit{weak-supervision}$; (3) $\textit{looking up}$ words (for which no co-articulated labelled examples are available) in visual sign language dictionaries to enable novel sign spotting. These three tasks are integrated into a unified learning framework using the principles of Noise Contrastive Estimation and Multiple Instance Learning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on low-shot sign spotting benchmarks. In addition, we contribute a machine-readable British Sign Language (BSL) dictionary dataset of isolated signs, BSLDict, to facilitate study of this task. The dataset, models and code are available at our project page.      
### 22.Single-Image 3D Face Reconstruction under Perspective Projection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04126.pdf)
>  In 3D face reconstruction, orthogonal projection has been widely employed to substitute perspective projection to simplify the fitting process. This approximation performs well when the distance between camera and face is far enough. However, in some scenarios that the face is very close to camera or moving along the camera axis, the methods suffer from the inaccurate reconstruction and unstable temporal fitting due to the distortion under the perspective projection. In this paper, we aim to address the problem of single-image 3D face reconstruction under perspective projection. Specifically, a deep neural network, Perspective Network (PerspNet), is proposed to simultaneously reconstruct 3D face shape in canonical space and learn the correspondence between 2D pixels and 3D points, by which the 6DoF (6 Degrees of Freedom) face pose can be estimated to represent perspective projection. Besides, we contribute a large ARKitFace dataset to enable the training and evaluation of 3D face reconstruction solutions under the scenarios of perspective projection, which has 902,724 2D facial images with ground-truth 3D face mesh and annotated 6DoF pose parameters. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.      
### 23.Identifying Fixation and Saccades in Virtual Reality  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04121.pdf)
>  Gaze recognition can significantly reduce the amount of eye movement data for a better understanding of cognitive and visual processing. Gaze recognition is an essential precondition for eye-based interaction applications in virtual reality. However, the three-dimensional characteristics of virtual reality environments also pose new challenges to existing recognition algorithms. Based on seven evaluation metrics and the Overall score (the mean of the seven normalized metric values), we obtain optimal parameters of three existing recognition algorithms (Velocity-Threshold Identification, Dispersion-Threshold Identification, and Velocity &amp; Dispersion-Threshold Identification) and our modified Velocity &amp; Dispersion-Threshold Identification algorithm. We compare the performance of these four algorithms with optimal parameters. The results show that our modified Velocity &amp; Dispersion-Threshold Identification performs the best. The impact of interface complexity on classification results is also preliminarily explored. The results show that the algorithms are not sensitive to interface complexity.      
### 24.SmoothNets: Optimizing CNN architecture design for differentially private deep learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04095.pdf)
>  The arguably most widely employed algorithm to train deep neural networks with Differential Privacy is DPSGD, which requires clipping and noising of per-sample gradients. This introduces a reduction in model utility compared to non-private training. Empirically, it can be observed that this accuracy degradation is strongly dependent on the model architecture. We investigated this phenomenon and, by combining components which exhibit good individual performance, distilled a new model architecture termed SmoothNet, which is characterised by increased robustness to the challenges of DP-SGD training. Experimentally, we benchmark SmoothNet against standard architectures on two benchmark datasets and observe that our architecture outperforms others, reaching an accuracy of 73.5\% on CIFAR-10 at $\varepsilon=7.0$ and 69.2\% at $\varepsilon=7.0$ on ImageNette, a state-of-the-art result compared to prior architectural modifications for DP.      
### 25.Single-view 3D Body and Cloth Reconstruction under Complex Poses  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04087.pdf)
>  Recent advances in 3D human shape reconstruction from single images have shown impressive results, leveraging on deep networks that model the so-called implicit function to learn the occupancy status of arbitrarily dense 3D points in space. However, while current algorithms based on this paradigm, like PiFuHD, are able to estimate accurate geometry of the human shape and clothes, they require high-resolution input images and are not able to capture complex body poses. Most training and evaluation is performed on 1k-resolution images of humans standing in front of the camera under neutral body poses. In this paper, we leverage publicly available data to extend existing implicit function-based models to deal with images of humans that can have arbitrary poses and self-occluded limbs. We argue that the representation power of the implicit function is not sufficient to simultaneously model details of the geometry and of the body pose. We, therefore, propose a coarse-to-fine approach in which we first learn an implicit function that maps the input image to a 3D body shape with a low level of detail, but which correctly fits the underlying human pose, despite its complexity. We then learn a displacement map, conditioned on the smoothed surface and on the input image, which encodes the high-frequency details of the clothes and body. In the experimental section, we show that this coarse-to-fine strategy represents a very good trade-off between shape detail and pose correctness, comparing favorably to the most recent state-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be made publicly available.      
### 26.Beyond Bounding Box: Multimodal Knowledge Learning for Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04072.pdf)
>  Multimodal supervision has achieved promising results in many visual language understanding tasks, where the language plays an essential role as a hint or context for recognizing and locating instances. However, due to the defects of the human-annotated language corpus, multimodal supervision remains unexplored in fully supervised object detection scenarios. In this paper, we take advantage of language prompt to introduce effective and unbiased linguistic supervision into object detection, and propose a new mechanism called multimodal knowledge learning (\textbf{MKL}), which is required to learn knowledge from language supervision. Specifically, we design prompts and fill them with the bounding box annotations to generate descriptions containing extensive hints and context for instances recognition and localization. The knowledge from language is then distilled into the detection model via maximizing cross-modal mutual information in both image- and object-level. Moreover, the generated descriptions are manipulated to produce hard negatives to further boost the detector performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields a consistent performance gain by 1.6\% $\sim$ 2.1\% and achieves state-of-the-art on MS-COCO and OpenImages datasets.      
### 27.Multi-level Consistency Learning for Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04066.pdf)
>  Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims to apply knowledge learned from a fully labeled source domain to a scarcely labeled target domain. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Consistency Learning (MCL) framework for SSDA. Specifically, our MCL regularizes the consistency of different views of target domain samples at three levels: (i) at inter-domain level, we robustly and accurately align the source and target domains using a prototype-based optimal transport method that utilizes the pros and cons of different views of target samples; (ii) at intra-domain level, we facilitate the learning of both discriminative and compact target feature representations by proposing a novel class-wise contrastive clustering loss; (iii) at sample level, we follow standard practice and improve the prediction accuracy by conducting a consistency-based self-training. Empirically, we verified the effectiveness of our MCL framework on three popular SSDA benchmarks, i.e., VisDA2017, DomainNet, and Office-Home datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our MCL framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance.      
### 28.Multilevel Hierarchical Network with Multiscale Sampling for Video Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04061.pdf)
>  Video question answering (VideoQA) is challenging given its multimodal combination of visual understanding and natural language processing. While most existing approaches ignore the visual appearance-motion information at different temporal scales, it is unknown how to incorporate the multilevel processing capacity of a deep learning model with such multiscale information. Targeting these issues, this paper proposes a novel Multilevel Hierarchical Network (MHN) with multiscale sampling for VideoQA. MHN comprises two modules, namely Recurrent Multimodal Interaction (RMI) and Parallel Visual Reasoning (PVR). With a multiscale sampling, RMI iterates the interaction of appearance-motion information at each scale and the question embeddings to build the multilevel question-guided visual representations. Thereon, with a shared transformer encoder, PVR infers the visual cues at each level in parallel to fit with answering different question types that may rely on the visual information at relevant levels. Through extensive experiments on three VideoQA datasets, we demonstrate improved performances than previous state-of-the-arts and justify the effectiveness of each part of our method.      
### 29.Exploiting Digital Surface Models for Inferring Super-Resolution for Remotely Sensed Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04056.pdf)
>  Despite the plethora of successful Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) models applied to natural images, their application to remote sensing imagery tends to produce poor results. Remote sensing imagery is often more complicated than natural images and has its peculiarities such as being of lower resolution, it contains noise, and often depicting large textured surfaces. As a result, applying non-specialized SRR models on remote sensing imagery results in artifacts and poor reconstructions. To address these problems, this paper proposes an architecture inspired by previous research work, introducing a novel approach for forcing an SRR model to output realistic remote sensing images: instead of relying on feature-space similarities as a perceptual loss, the model considers pixel-level information inferred from the normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) of the image. This strategy allows the application of better-informed updates during the training of the model which sources from a task (elevation map inference) that is closely related to remote sensing. Nonetheless, the nDSM auxiliary information is not required during production and thus the model infers a super-resolution image without any additional data besides its low-resolution pairs. We assess our model on two remotely sensed datasets of different spatial resolutions that also contain the DSM pairs of the images: the DFC2018 dataset and the dataset containing the national Lidar fly-by of Luxembourg. Based on visual inspection, the inferred super-resolution images exhibit particularly superior quality. In particular, the results for the high-resolution DFC2018 dataset are realistic and almost indistinguishable from the ground truth images.      
### 30.Incremental-DETR: Incremental Few-Shot Object Detection via Self-Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04042.pdf)
>  Incremental few-shot object detection aims at detecting novel classes without forgetting knowledge of the base classes with only a few labeled training data from the novel classes. Most related prior works are on incremental object detection that rely on the availability of abundant training samples per novel class that substantially limits the scalability to real-world setting where novel data can be scarce. In this paper, we propose the Incremental-DETR that does incremental few-shot object detection via fine-tuning and self-supervised learning on the DETR object detector. To alleviate severe over-fitting with few novel class data, we first fine-tune the class-specific components of DETR with self-supervision from additional object proposals generated using Selective Search as pseudo labels. We further introduce a incremental few-shot fine-tuning strategy with knowledge distillation on the class-specific components of DETR to encourage the network in detecting novel classes without catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on standard incremental object detection and incremental few-shot object detection settings show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.      
### 31.Towards Racially Unbiased Skin Tone Estimation via Scene Disambiguation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03962.pdf)
>  Virtual facial avatars will play an increasingly important role in immersive communication, games and the metaverse, and it is therefore critical that they be inclusive. This requires accurate recovery of the appearance, represented by albedo, regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity. While significant progress has been made on estimating 3D facial geometry, albedo estimation has received less attention. The task is fundamentally ambiguous because the observed color is a function of albedo and lighting, both of which are unknown. We find that current methods are biased towards light skin tones due to (1) strongly biased priors that prefer lighter pigmentation and (2) algorithmic solutions that disregard the light/albedo ambiguity. To address this, we propose a new evaluation dataset (FAIR) and an algorithm (TRUST) to improve albedo estimation and, hence, fairness. Specifically, we create the first facial albedo evaluation benchmark where subjects are balanced in terms of skin color, and measure accuracy using the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) metric. We then address the light/albedo ambiguity by building on a key observation: the image of the full scene -- as opposed to a cropped image of the face -- contains important information about lighting that can be used for disambiguation. TRUST regresses facial albedo by conditioning both on the face region and a global illumination signal obtained from the scene image. Our experimental results show significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods on albedo estimation, both in terms of accuracy and fairness. The evaluation benchmark and code will be made available for research purposes at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://trust.is.tue.mpg.de" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 32.High-Resolution UAV Image Generation for Sorghum Panicle Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03947.pdf)
>  The number of panicles (or heads) of Sorghum plants is an important phenotypic trait for plant development and grain yield estimation. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) enables the capability of collecting and analyzing Sorghum images on a large scale. Deep learning can provide methods for estimating phenotypic traits from UAV images but requires a large amount of labeled data. The lack of training data due to the labor-intensive ground truthing of UAV images causes a major bottleneck in developing methods for Sorghum panicle detection and counting. In this paper, we present an approach that uses synthetic training images from generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data augmentation to enhance the performance of Sorghum panicle detection and counting. Our method can generate synthetic high-resolution UAV RGB images with panicle labels by using image-to-image translation GANs with a limited ground truth dataset of real UAV RGB images. The results show the improvements in panicle detection and counting using our data augmentation approach.      
### 33.Unsupervised Discovery and Composition of Object Light Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03923.pdf)
>  Neural scene representations, both continuous and discrete, have recently emerged as a powerful new paradigm for 3D scene understanding. Recent efforts have tackled unsupervised discovery of object-centric neural scene representations. However, the high cost of ray-marching, exacerbated by the fact that each object representation has to be ray-marched separately, leads to insufficiently sampled radiance fields and thus, noisy renderings, poor framerates, and high memory and time complexity during training and rendering. Here, we propose to represent objects in an object-centric, compositional scene representation as light fields. We propose a novel light field compositor module that enables reconstructing the global light field from a set of object-centric light fields. Dubbed Compositional Object Light Fields (COLF), our method enables unsupervised learning of object-centric neural scene representations, state-of-the-art reconstruction and novel view synthesis performance on standard datasets, and rendering and training speeds at orders of magnitude faster than existing 3D approaches.      
### 34.SoftPool++: An Encoder-Decoder Network for Point Cloud Completion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03899.pdf)
>  We propose a novel convolutional operator for the task of point cloud completion. One striking characteristic of our approach is that, conversely to related work it does not require any max-pooling or voxelization operation. Instead, the proposed operator used to learn the point cloud embedding in the encoder extracts permutation-invariant features from the point cloud via a soft-pooling of feature activations, which are able to preserve fine-grained geometric details. These features are then passed on to a decoder architecture. Due to the compression in the encoder, a typical limitation of this type of architectures is that they tend to lose parts of the input shape structure. We propose to overcome this limitation by using skip connections specifically devised for point clouds, where links between corresponding layers in the encoder and the decoder are established. As part of these connections, we introduce a transformation matrix that projects the features from the encoder to the decoder and vice-versa. The quantitative and qualitative results on the task of object completion from partial scans on the ShapeNet dataset show that incorporating our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in shape completion both at low and high resolutions.      
### 35.ConvMAE: Masked Convolution Meets Masked Autoencoders  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03892.pdf)
>  Vision Transformers (ViT) become widely-adopted architectures for various vision tasks. Masked auto-encoding for feature pretraining and multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer architectures can further unleash the potentials of ViT, leading to state-of-the-art performances on image classification, detection and semantic segmentation. In this paper, our ConvMAE framework demonstrates that multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer can learn more discriminative representations via the mask auto-encoding scheme. However, directly using the original masking strategy leads to the heavy computational cost and pretraining-finetuning discrepancy. To tackle the issue, we adopt the masked convolution to prevent information leakage in the convolution blocks. A simple block-wise masking strategy is proposed to ensure computational efficiency. We also propose to more directly supervise the multi-scale features of the encoder to boost multi-scale features. Based on our pretrained ConvMAE models, ConvMAE-Base improves ImageNet-1K finetuning accuracy by 1.4% compared with MAE-Base. On object detection, ConvMAE-Base finetuned for only 25 epochs surpasses MAE-Base fined-tuned for 100 epochs by 2.9% box AP and 2.2% mask AP respectively.

### 36.Cross-lingual Adaptation for Recipe Retrieval with Mixup  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03891.pdf)
>  Cross-modal recipe retrieval has attracted research attention in recent years, thanks to the availability of large-scale paired data for training. Nevertheless, obtaining adequate recipe-image pairs covering the majority of cuisines for supervised learning is difficult if not impossible. By transferring knowledge learnt from a data-rich cuisine to a data-scarce cuisine, domain adaptation sheds light on this practical problem. Nevertheless, existing works assume recipes in source and target domains are mostly originated from the same cuisine and written in the same language. This paper studies unsupervised domain adaptation for image-to-recipe retrieval, where recipes in source and target domains are in different languages. Moreover, only recipes are available for training in the target domain. A novel recipe mixup method is proposed to learn transferable embedding features between the two domains. Specifically, recipe mixup produces mixed recipes to form an intermediate domain by discretely exchanging the section(s) between source and target recipes. To bridge the domain gap, recipe mixup loss is proposed to enforce the intermediate domain to locate in the shortest geodesic path between source and target domains in the recipe embedding space. By using Recipe 1M dataset as source domain (English) and Vireo-FoodTransfer dataset as target domain (Chinese), empirical experiments verify the effectiveness of recipe mixup for cross-lingual adaptation in the context of image-to-recipe retrieval.      
### 37.Multimodal Semi-Supervised Learning for Text Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03873.pdf)
>  Until recently, the number of public real-world text images was insufficient for training scene text recognizers. Therefore, most modern training methods rely on synthetic data and operate in a fully supervised manner. Nevertheless, the amount of public real-world text images has increased significantly lately, including a great deal of unlabeled data. Leveraging these resources requires semi-supervised approaches; however, the few existing methods do not account for vision-language multimodality structure and therefore suboptimal for state-of-the-art multimodal architectures. To bridge this gap, we present semi-supervised learning for multimodal text recognizers (SemiMTR) that leverages unlabeled data at each modality training phase. Notably, our method refrains from extra training stages and maintains the current three-stage multimodal training procedure. Our algorithm starts by pretraining the vision model through a single-stage training that unifies self-supervised learning with supervised training. More specifically, we extend an existing visual representation learning algorithm and propose the first contrastive-based method for scene text recognition. After pretraining the language model on a text corpus, we fine-tune the entire network via a sequential, character-level, consistency regularization between weakly and strongly augmented views of text images. In a novel setup, consistency is enforced on each modality separately. Extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms the current training schemes and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple scene text recognition benchmarks.      
### 38.Adversarial Learning of Hard Positives for Place Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03871.pdf)
>  Image retrieval methods for place recognition learn global image descriptors that are used for fetching geo-tagged images at inference time. Recent works have suggested employing weak and self-supervision for mining hard positives and hard negatives in order to improve localization accuracy and robustness to visibility changes (e.g. in illumination or view point). However, generating hard positives, which is essential for obtaining robustness, is still limited to hard-coded or global augmentations. In this work we propose an adversarial method to guide the creation of hard positives for training image retrieval networks. Our method learns local and global augmentation policies which will increase the training loss, while the image retrieval network is forced to learn more powerful features for discriminating increasingly difficult examples. This approach allows the image retrieval network to generalize beyond the hard examples presented in the data and learn features that are robust to a wide range of variations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art recalls on the Pitts250 and Tokyo 24/7 benchmarks and outperforms recent image retrieval methods on the rOxford and rParis datasets by a noticeable margin.      
### 39.Zero and R2D2: A Large-scale Chinese Cross-modal Benchmark and A Vision-Language Framework  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03860.pdf)
>  Vision-language pre-training (VLP) relying on large-scale pre-training datasets has shown premier performance on various downstream tasks. In this sense, a complete and fair benchmark (i.e., including large-scale pre-training datasets and a variety of downstream datasets) is essential for VLP. But how to construct such a benchmark in Chinese remains a critical problem. To this end, we develop a large-scale Chinese cross-modal benchmark called Zero for AI researchers to fairly compare VLP models. We release two pre-training datasets and five fine-tuning datasets for downstream tasks. Furthermore, we propose a novel pre-training framework of pre-Ranking + Ranking for cross-modal learning. Specifically, we apply global contrastive pre-ranking to learn the individual representations of images and Chinese texts, respectively. We then fuse the representations in a fine-grained ranking manner via an image-text cross encoder and a text-image cross encoder. To further enhance the capability of the model, we propose a two-way distillation strategy consisting of target-guided Distillation and feature-guided Distillation. For simplicity, we call our model R2D2. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on four public cross-modal datasets and our five downstream datasets. The datasets, models and codes will be made available.      
### 40.On Conditioning the Input Noise for Controlled Image Generation with Diffusion Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03859.pdf)
>  Conditional image generation has paved the way for several breakthroughs in image editing, generating stock photos and 3-D object generation. This continues to be a significant area of interest with the rise of new state-of-the-art methods that are based on diffusion models. However, diffusion models provide very little control over the generated image, which led to subsequent works exploring techniques like classifier guidance, that provides a way to trade off diversity with fidelity. In this work, we explore techniques to condition diffusion models with carefully crafted input noise artifacts. This allows generation of images conditioned on semantic attributes. This is different from existing approaches that input Gaussian noise and further introduce conditioning at the diffusion model's inference step. Our experiments over several examples and conditional settings show the potential of our approach.      
### 41.Fully Automated Binary Pattern Extraction For Finger Vein Identification using Double Optimization Stages-Based Unsupervised Learning Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03840.pdf)
>  Today, finger vein identification is gaining popularity as a potential biometric identification framework solution. Machine learning-based unsupervised, supervised, and deep learning algorithms have had a significant influence on finger vein detection and recognition at the moment. Deep learning, on the other hand, necessitates a large number of training datasets that must be manually produced and labeled. In this research, we offer a completely automated unsupervised learning strategy for training dataset creation. Our method is intended to extract and build a decent binary mask training dataset completely automated. In this technique, two optimization steps are devised and employed. The initial stage of optimization is to create a completely automated unsupervised image clustering based on finger vein image localization. Worldwide finger vein pattern orientation estimation is employed in the second optimization to optimize the retrieved finger vein lines. Finally, the proposed system achieves 99.6 - percent pattern extraction accuracy, which is significantly higher than other common unsupervised learning methods like k-means and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM).      
### 42.Iterative Geometry-Aware Cross Guidance Network for Stereo Image Inpainting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03825.pdf)
>  Currently, single image inpainting has achieved promising results based on deep convolutional neural networks. However, inpainting on stereo images with missing regions has not been explored thoroughly, which is also a significant but different problem. One crucial requirement for stereo image inpainting is stereo consistency. To achieve it, we propose an Iterative Geometry-Aware Cross Guidance Network (IGGNet). The IGGNet contains two key ingredients, i.e., a Geometry-Aware Attention (GAA) module and an Iterative Cross Guidance (ICG) strategy. The GAA module relies on the epipolar geometry cues and learns the geometry-aware guidance from one view to another, which is beneficial to make the corresponding regions in two views consistent. However, learning guidance from co-existing missing regions is challenging. To address this issue, the ICG strategy is proposed, which can alternately narrow down the missing regions of the two views in an iterative manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed network outperforms the latest stereo image inpainting model and state-of-the-art single image inpainting models.      
### 43.Unsupervised Homography Estimation with Coplanarity-Aware GAN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03821.pdf)
>  Estimating homography from an image pair is a fundamental problem in image alignment. Unsupervised learning methods have received increasing attention in this field due to their promising performance and label-free training. However, existing methods do not explicitly consider the problem of plane-induced parallax, which will make the predicted homography compromised on multiple planes. In this work, we propose a novel method HomoGAN to guide unsupervised homography estimation to focus on the dominant plane. First, a multi-scale transformer network is designed to predict homography from the feature pyramids of input images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised GAN to impose coplanarity constraint on the predicted homography, which is realized by using a generator to predict a mask of aligned regions, and then a discriminator to check if two masked feature maps are induced by a single homography. To validate the effectiveness of HomoGAN and its components, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset, and the results show that our matching error is 22% lower than the previous SOTA method.

### 44.PGADA: Perturbation-Guided Adversarial Alignment for Few-shot Learning Under the Support-Query Shift  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03817.pdf)
>  Few-shot learning methods aim to embed the data to a low-dimensional embedding space and then classify the unseen query data to the seen support set. While these works assume that the support set and the query set lie in the same embedding space, a distribution shift usually occurs between the support set and the query set, i.e., the Support-Query Shift, in the real world. Though optimal transportation has shown convincing results in aligning different distributions, we find that the small perturbations in the images would significantly misguide the optimal transportation and thus degrade the model performance. To relieve the misalignment, we first propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method, namely Perturbation-Guided Adversarial Alignment (PGADA), which generates the hard examples in a self-supervised manner. In addition, we introduce Regularized Optimal Transportation to derive a smooth optimal transportation plan. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets manifest that our framework significantly outperforms the eleven state-of-the-art methods on three datasets.      
### 45.Fingerprint Template Invertibility: Minutiae vs. Deep Templates  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03809.pdf)
>  Much of the success of fingerprint recognition is attributed to minutiae-based fingerprint representation. It was believed that minutiae templates could not be inverted to obtain a high fidelity fingerprint image, but this assumption has been shown to be false. The success of deep learning has resulted in alternative fingerprint representations (embeddings), in the hope that they might offer better recognition accuracy as well as non-invertibility of deep network-based templates. We evaluate whether deep fingerprint templates suffer from the same reconstruction attacks as the minutiae templates. We show that while a deep template can be inverted to produce a fingerprint image that could be matched to its source image, deep templates are more resistant to reconstruction attacks than minutiae templates. In particular, reconstructed fingerprint images from minutiae templates yield a TAR of about 100.0% (98.3%) @ FAR of 0.01% for type-I (type-II) attacks using a state-of-the-art commercial fingerprint matcher, when tested on NIST SD4. The corresponding attack performance for reconstructed fingerprint images from deep templates using the same commercial matcher yields a TAR of less than 1% for both type-I and type-II attacks; however, when the reconstructed images are matched using the same deep network, they achieve a TAR of 85.95% (68.10%) for type-I (type-II) attacks. Furthermore, what is missing from previous fingerprint template inversion studies is an evaluation of the black-box attack performance, which we perform using 3 different state-of-the-art fingerprint matchers. We conclude that fingerprint images generated by inverting minutiae templates are highly susceptible to both white-box and black-box attack evaluations, while fingerprint images generated by deep templates are resistant to black-box evaluations and comparatively less susceptible to white-box evaluations.      
### 46.Transformer Tracking with Cyclic Shifting Window Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03806.pdf)
>  Transformer architecture has been showing its great strength in visual object tracking, for its effective attention mechanism. Existing transformer-based approaches adopt the pixel-to-pixel attention strategy on flattened image features and unavoidably ignore the integrity of objects. In this paper, we propose a new transformer architecture with multi-scale cyclic shifting window attention for visual object tracking, elevating the attention from pixel to window level. The cross-window multi-scale attention has the advantage of aggregating attention at different scales and generates the best fine-scale match for the target object. Furthermore, the cyclic shifting strategy brings greater accuracy by expanding the window samples with positional information, and at the same time saves huge amounts of computational power by removing redundant calculations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which also sets the new state-of-the-art records on five challenging datasets, along with the VOT2020, UAV123, LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k benchmarks.      
### 47.A Closer Look at Few-shot Image Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03805.pdf)
>  Modern GANs excel at generating high quality and diverse images. However, when transferring the pretrained GANs on small target data (e.g., 10-shot), the generator tends to replicate the training samples. <br>Several methods have been proposed to address this few-shot image generation task, but there is a lack of effort to analyze them under a unified framework. <br>As our first contribution, we propose a framework to analyze existing methods during the adaptation. Our analysis discovers that while some methods have disproportionate focus on diversity preserving which impede quality improvement, all methods achieve similar quality after convergence. <br>Therefore, the better methods are those that can slow down diversity degradation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that there is still plenty of room to further slow down diversity degradation. <br>Informed by our analysis and to slow down the diversity degradation of the target generator during adaptation, our second contribution proposes to apply mutual information (MI) maximization to retain the source domain's rich multi-level diversity information in the target domain generator. <br>We propose to perform MI maximization by contrastive loss (CL), leverage the generator and discriminator as two feature encoders to extract different multi-level features for computing CL. We refer to our method as Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL). <br>Extensive experiments on several public datasets show that, while leading to a slower diversity-degrading generator during adaptation, our proposed DCL brings visually pleasant quality and state-of-the-art quantitative performance.      
### 48.Past and Future Motion Guided Network for Audio Visual Event Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03802.pdf)
>  In recent years, audio-visual event localization has attracted much attention. It's purpose is to detect the segment containing audio-visual events and recognize the event category from untrimmed videos. Existing methods use audio-guided visual attention to lead the model pay attention to the spatial area of the ongoing event, devoting to the correlation between audio and visual information but ignoring the correlation between audio and spatial motion. We propose a past and future motion extraction (pf-ME) module to mine the visual motion from videos ,embedded into the past and future motion guided network (PFAGN), and motion guided audio attention (MGAA) module to achieve focusing on the information related to interesting events in audio modality through the past and future visual motion. We choose AVE as the experimental verification dataset and the experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in both supervised and weakly-supervised settings.      
### 49.One-Class Knowledge Distillation for Face Presentation Attack Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03792.pdf)
>  Face presentation attack detection (PAD) has been extensively studied by research communities to enhance the security of face recognition systems. Although existing methods have achieved good performance on testing data with similar distribution as the training data, their performance degrades severely in application scenarios with data of unseen distributions. In situations where the training and testing data are drawn from different domains, a typical approach is to apply domain adaptation techniques to improve face PAD performance with the help of target domain data. However, it has always been a non-trivial challenge to collect sufficient data samples in the target domain, especially for attack samples. This paper introduces a teacher-student framework to improve the cross-domain performance of face PAD with one-class domain adaptation. In addition to the source domain data, the framework utilizes only a few genuine face samples of the target domain. Under this framework, a teacher network is trained with source domain samples to provide discriminative feature representations for face PAD. Student networks are trained to mimic the teacher network and learn similar representations for genuine face samples of the target domain. In the test phase, the similarity score between the representations of the teacher and student networks is used to distinguish attacks from genuine ones. To evaluate the proposed framework under one-class domain adaptation settings, we devised two new protocols and conducted extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines under one-class domain adaptation settings and even state-of-the-art methods with unsupervised domain adaptation.      
### 50.Non-parametric Depth Distribution Modelling based Depth Inference for Multi-view Stereo  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03783.pdf)
>  Recent cost volume pyramid based deep neural networks have unlocked the potential of efficiently leveraging high-resolution images for depth inference from multi-view stereo. In general, those approaches assume that the depth of each pixel follows a unimodal distribution. Boundary pixels usually follow a multi-modal distribution as they represent different depths; Therefore, the assumption results in an erroneous depth prediction at the coarser level of the cost volume pyramid and can not be corrected in the refinement levels leading to wrong depth predictions. In contrast, we propose constructing the cost volume by non-parametric depth distribution modeling to handle pixels with unimodal and multi-modal distributions. Our approach outputs multiple depth hypotheses at the coarser level to avoid errors in the early stage. As we perform local search around these multiple hypotheses in subsequent levels, our approach does not maintain the rigid depth spatial ordering and, therefore, we introduce a sparse cost aggregation network to derive information within each volume. We evaluate our approach extensively on two benchmark datasets: DTU and Tanks &amp; Temples. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin and achieves superior performance on boundary regions.

### 51.Semi-Cycled Generative Adversarial Networks for Real-World Face Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03777.pdf)
>  Real-world face super-resolution (SR) is a highly ill-posed image restoration task. The fully-cycled Cycle-GAN architecture is widely employed to achieve promising performance on face SR, but prone to produce artifacts upon challenging cases in real-world scenarios, since joint participation in the same degradation branch will impact final performance due to huge domain gap between real-world and synthetic LR ones obtained by generators. To better exploit the powerful generative capability of GAN for real-world face SR, in this paper, we establish two independent degradation branches in the forward and backward cycle-consistent reconstruction processes, respectively, while the two processes share the same restoration branch. Our Semi-Cycled Generative Adversarial Networks (SCGAN) is able to alleviate the adverse effects of the domain gap between the real-world LR face images and the synthetic LR ones, and to achieve accurate and robust face SR performance by the shared restoration branch regularized by both the forward and backward cycle-consistent learning processes.

### 52.SparseTT: Visual Tracking with Sparse Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03776.pdf)
>  Transformers have been successfully applied to the visual tracking task and significantly promote tracking performance. The self-attention mechanism designed to model long-range dependencies is the key to the success of Transformers. However, self-attention lacks focusing on the most relevant information in the search regions, making it easy to be distracted by background. In this paper, we relieve this issue with a sparse attention mechanism by focusing the most relevant information in the search regions, which enables a much accurate tracking. Furthermore, we introduce a double-head predictor to boost the accuracy of foreground-background classification and regression of target bounding boxes, which further improve the tracking performance. Extensive experiments show that, without bells and whistles, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on LaSOT, GOT-10k, TrackingNet, and UAV123, while running at 40 FPS. Notably, the training time of our method is reduced by 75% compared to that of TransT.

### 53.RoViST:Learning Robust Metrics for Visual Storytelling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03774.pdf)
>  Visual storytelling (VST) is the task of generating a story paragraph that describes a given image sequence. Most existing storytelling approaches have evaluated their models using traditional natural language generation metrics like BLEU or CIDEr. However, such metrics based on n-gram matching tend to have poor correlation with human evaluation scores and do not explicitly consider other criteria necessary for storytelling such as sentence structure or topic coherence. Moreover, a single score is not enough to assess a story as it does not inform us about what specific errors were made by the model. In this paper, we propose 3 evaluation metrics sets that analyses which aspects we would look for in a good story: 1) visual grounding, 2) coherence, and 3) non-redundancy. We measure the reliability of our metric sets by analysing its correlation with human judgement scores on a sample of machine stories obtained from 4 state-of-the-arts models trained on the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST). Our metric sets outperforms other metrics on human correlation, and could be served as a learning based evaluation metric set that is complementary to existing rule-based metrics.      
### 54.Recurrent Dynamic Embedding for Video Object Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03761.pdf)
>  Space-time memory (STM) based video object segmentation (VOS) networks usually keep increasing memory bank every several frames, which shows excellent performance. However, 1) the hardware cannot withstand the ever-increasing memory requirements as the video length increases. 2) Storing lots of information inevitably introduces lots of noise, which is not conducive to reading the most important information from the memory bank. In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Dynamic Embedding (RDE) to build a memory bank of constant size. Specifically, we explicitly generate and update RDE by the proposed Spatio-temporal Aggregation Module (SAM), which exploits the cue of historical information. To avoid error accumulation owing to the recurrent usage of SAM, we propose an unbiased guidance loss during the training stage, which makes SAM more robust in long videos. Moreover, the predicted masks in the memory bank are inaccurate due to the inaccurate network inference, which affects the segmentation of the query frame. To address this problem, we design a novel self-correction strategy so that the network can repair the embeddings of masks with different qualities in the memory bank. Extensive experiments show our method achieves the best tradeoff between performance and speed.

### 55.End-to-End Rubbing Restoration Using Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03743.pdf)
>  Rubbing restorations are significant for preserving world cultural history. In this paper, we propose the RubbingGAN model for restoring incomplete rubbing characters. Specifically, we collect characters from the Zhang Menglong Bei and build up the first rubbing restoration dataset. We design the first generative adversarial network for rubbing restoration. Based on the dataset we collect, we apply the RubbingGAN to learn the Zhang Menglong Bei font style and restore the characters. The results of experiments show that RubbingGAN can repair both slightly and severely incomplete rubbing characters fast and effectively.      
### 56.Synthetic Point Cloud Generation for Class Segmentation Applications  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03738.pdf)
>  Maintenance of industrial facilities is a growing hazard due to the cumbersome process needed to identify infrastructure degradation. Digital Twins have the potential to improve maintenance by monitoring the continuous digital representation of infrastructure. However, the time needed to map the existing geometry makes their use prohibitive. We previously developed class segmentation algorithms to automate digital twinning, however a vast amount of annotated point clouds is needed. Currently, synthetic data generation for automated segmentation is non-existent. We used Helios++ to automatically segment point clouds from 3D models. Our research has the potential to pave the ground for efficient industrial class segmentation.      
### 57.A Review on Viewpoints and Path-planning for UAV-based 3D Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03716.pdf)
>  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used platforms to carry data capturing sensors for various applications. The reason for this success can be found in many aspects: the high maneuverability of the UAVs, the capability of performing autonomous data acquisition, flying at different heights, and the possibility to reach almost any vantage point. The selection of appropriate viewpoints and planning the optimum trajectories of UAVs is an emerging topic that aims at increasing the automation, efficiency and reliability of the data capturing process to achieve a dataset with desired quality. On the other hand, 3D reconstruction using the data captured by UAVs is also attracting attention in research and industry. This review paper investigates a wide range of model-free and model-based algorithms for viewpoint and path planning for 3D reconstruction of large-scale objects. The analyzed approaches are limited to those that employ a single-UAV as a data capturing platform for outdoor 3D reconstruction purposes. In addition to discussing the evaluation strategies, this paper also highlights the innovations and limitations of the investigated approaches. It concludes with a critical analysis of the existing challenges and future research perspectives.      
### 58.Keratoconus Classifier for Smartphone-based Corneal Topographer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03702.pdf)
>  Keratoconus is a severe eye disease that leads to deformation of the cornea. It impacts people aged 10-25 years and is the leading cause of blindness in that demography. Corneal topography is the gold standard for keratoconus diagnosis. It is a non-invasive process performed using expensive and bulky medical devices called corneal topographers. This makes it inaccessible to large populations, especially in the Global South. Low-cost smartphone-based corneal topographers, such as SmartKC, have been proposed to make keratoconus diagnosis accessible. Similar to medical-grade topographers, SmartKC outputs curvature heatmaps and quantitative metrics that need to be evaluated by doctors for keratoconus diagnosis. An automatic scheme for evaluation of these heatmaps and quantitative values can play a crucial role in screening keratoconus in areas where doctors are not available. In this work, we propose a dual-head convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying keratoconus on the heatmaps generated by SmartKC. Since SmartKC is a new device and only had a small dataset (114 samples), we developed a 2-stage transfer learning strategy -- using historical data collected from a medical-grade topographer and a subset of SmartKC data -- to satisfactorily train our network. This, combined with our domain-specific data augmentations, achieved a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 94.2%.      
### 59.GenISP: Neural ISP for Low-Light Machine Cognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03688.pdf)
>  Object detection in low-light conditions remains a challenging but important problem with many practical implications. Some recent works show that, in low-light conditions, object detectors using raw image data are more robust than detectors using image data processed by a traditional ISP pipeline. To improve detection performance in low-light conditions, one can fine-tune the detector to use raw image data or use a dedicated low-light neural pipeline trained with paired low- and normal-light data to restore and enhance the image. However, different camera sensors have different spectral sensitivity and learning-based models using raw images process data in the sensor-specific color space. Thus, once trained, they do not guarantee generalization to other camera sensors. We propose to improve generalization to unseen camera sensors by implementing a minimal neural ISP pipeline for machine cognition, named GenISP, that explicitly incorporates Color Space Transformation to a device-independent color space. We also propose a two-stage color processing implemented by two image-to-parameter modules that take down-sized image as input and regress global color correction parameters. Moreover, we propose to train our proposed GenISP under the guidance of a pre-trained object detector and avoid making assumptions about perceptual quality of the image, but rather optimize the image representation for machine cognition. At the inference stage, GenISP can be paired with any object detector. We perform extensive experiments to compare our method to other low-light image restoration and enhancement methods in an extrinsic task-based evaluation and validate that GenISP can generalize to unseen sensors and object detectors. Finally, we contribute a low-light dataset of 7K raw images annotated with 46K bounding boxes for task-based benchmarking of future low-light image restoration and object detection.      
### 60.Playing Tic-Tac-Toe Games with Intelligent Single-pixel Imaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03663.pdf)
>  Single-pixel imaging (SPI) is a novel optical imaging technique by replacing a two-dimensional pixelated sensor with a single-pixel detector and pattern illuminations. SPI have been extensively used for various tasks related to image acquisition and processing. In this work, a novel non-image-based task of playing Tic-Tac-Toe games interactively is merged into the framework of SPI. An optoelectronic artificial intelligent (AI) player with minimal digital computation can detect the game states, generate optimal moves and display output results mainly by pattern illumination and single-pixel detection. Simulated and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of proposed scheme and its unbeatable performance against human players.      
### 61.Arrhythmia Classifier using Binarized Convolutional Neural Network for Resource-Constrained Devices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03661.pdf)
>  Monitoring electrocardiogram signals is of great significance for the diagnosis of arrhythmias. In recent years, deep learning and convolutional neural networks have been widely used in the classification of cardiac arrhythmias. However, the existing neural network applied to ECG signal detection usually requires a lot of computing resources, which is not friendlyF to resource-constrained equipment, and it is difficult to realize real-time monitoring. In this paper, a binarized convolutional neural network suitable for ECG monitoring is proposed, which is hardware-friendly and more suitable for use in resource-constrained wearable devices. Targeting the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the classifier based on this network reached an accuracy of 95.67% in the five-class test. Compared with the proposed baseline full-precision network with an accuracy of 96.45%, it is only 0.78% lower. Importantly, it achieves 12.65 times the computing speedup, 24.8 times the storage compression ratio, and only requires a quarter of the memory overhead.      
### 62.Distilling Inter-Class Distance for Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03650.pdf)
>  Knowledge distillation is widely adopted in semantic segmentation to reduce the computation cost.The previous knowledge distillation methods for semantic segmentation focus on pixel-wise feature alignment and intra-class feature variation distillation, neglecting to transfer the knowledge of the inter-class distance in the feature space, which is important for semantic segmentation. To address this issue, we propose an Inter-class Distance Distillation (IDD) method to transfer the inter-class distance in the feature space from the teacher network to the student network. Furthermore, semantic segmentation is a position-dependent task,thus we exploit a position information distillation module to help the student network encode more position information. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets: Cityscapes, Pascal VOC and ADE20K show that our method is helpful to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation models and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. E.g. it boosts the benchmark model("PSPNet+ResNet18") by 7.50% in accuracy on the Cityscapes dataset.      
### 63.Automatic Velocity Picking Using a Multi-Information Fusion Deep Semantic Segmentation Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03645.pdf)
>  Velocity picking, a critical step in seismic data processing, has been studied for decades. Although manual picking can produce accurate normal moveout (NMO) velocities from the velocity spectra of prestack gathers, it is time-consuming and becomes infeasible with the emergence of large amount of seismic data. Numerous automatic velocity picking methods have thus been developed. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have produced good results on the seismic data with medium and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Unfortunately, it still lacks a picking method to automatically generate accurate velocities in the situations of low SNR. In this paper, we propose a multi-information fusion network (MIFN) to estimate stacking velocity from the fusion information of velocity spectra and stack gather segments (SGS). In particular, we transform the velocity picking problem into a semantic segmentation problem based on the velocity spectrum images. Meanwhile, the information provided by SGS is used as a prior in the network to assist segmentation. The experimental results on two field datasets show that the picking results of MIFN are stable and accurate for the scenarios with medium and high SNR, and it also performs well in low SNR scenarios.      
### 64.Calibrating Label Distribution for Class-Imbalanced Barely-Supervised Knee Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03644.pdf)
>  Segmentation of 3D knee MR images is important for the assessment of osteoarthritis. Like other medical data, the volume-wise labeling of knee MR images is expertise-demanded and time-consuming; hence semi-supervised learning (SSL), particularly barely-supervised learning, is highly desirable for training with insufficient labeled data. We observed that the class imbalance problem is severe in the knee MR images as the cartilages only occupy 6% of foreground volumes, and the situation becomes worse without sufficient labeled data. To address the above problem, we present a novel framework for barely-supervised knee segmentation with noisy and imbalanced labels. Our framework leverages label distribution to encourage the network to put more effort into learning cartilage parts. Specifically, we utilize 1.) label quantity distribution for modifying the objective loss function to a class-aware weighted form and 2.) label position distribution for constructing a cropping probability mask to crop more sub-volumes in cartilage areas from both labeled and unlabeled inputs. In addition, we design dual uncertainty-aware sampling supervision to enhance the supervision of low-confident categories for efficient unsupervised learning. Experiments show that our proposed framework brings significant improvements by incorporating the unlabeled data and alleviating the problem of class imbalance. More importantly, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art SSL methods, demonstrating the potential of our framework for the more challenging SSL setting.      
### 65.Comparison Knowledge Translation for Generalizable Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03633.pdf)
>  Deep learning has recently achieved remarkable performance in image classification tasks, which depends heavily on massive annotation. However, the classification mechanism of existing deep learning models seems to contrast to humans' recognition mechanism. With only a glance at an image of the object even unknown type, humans can quickly and precisely find other same category objects from massive images, which benefits from daily recognition of various objects. In this paper, we attempt to build a generalizable framework that emulates the humans' recognition mechanism in the image classification task, hoping to improve the classification performance on unseen categories with the support of annotations of other categories. Specifically, we investigate a new task termed Comparison Knowledge Translation (CKT). Given a set of fully labeled categories, CKT aims to translate the comparison knowledge learned from the labeled categories to a set of novel categories. To this end, we put forward a Comparison Classification Translation Network (CCT-Net), which comprises a comparison classifier and a matching discriminator. The comparison classifier is devised to classify whether two images belong to the same category or not, while the matching discriminator works together in an adversarial manner to ensure whether classified results match the truth. Exhaustive experiments show that CCT-Net achieves surprising generalization ability on unseen categories and SOTA performance on target categories.      
### 66.Sparse Regularized Correlation Filter for UAV Object Tracking with adaptive Contextual Learning and Keyfilter Selection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03627.pdf)
>  Recently, correlation filter has been widely applied in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking due to its high frame rates, robustness and low calculation resources. However, it is fragile because of two inherent defects, i.e, boundary effect and filter corruption. Some methods by enlarging the search area can mitigate the boundary effect, yet introducing the undesired background distractors. Another approaches can alleviate the temporal degeneration of learned filters by introducing the temporal regularizer, which depends on the assumption that the filers between consecutive frames should be coherent. In fact, sometimes the filers at the ($t-1$)th frame is vulnerable to heavy occlusion from backgrounds, which causes that the assumption does not hold. To handle them, in this work, we propose a novel $\ell_{1}$ regularization correlation filter with adaptive contextual learning and keyfilter selection for UAV tracking. Firstly, we adaptively detect the positions of effective contextual distractors by the aid of the distribution of local maximum values on the response map of current frame which is generated by using the previous correlation filter model. Next, we eliminate inconsistent labels for the tracked target by removing one on each distractor and develop a new score scheme for each distractor. Then, we can select the keyfilter from the filters pool by finding the maximal similarity between the target at the current frame and the target template corresponding to each filter in the filters pool. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments on three authoritative UAV datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art tracking methods based on correlation filter framework.      
### 67.Automatic Block-wise Pruning with Auxiliary Gating Structures for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03602.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks are prevailing in deep learning tasks. However, they suffer from massive cost issues when working on mobile devices. Network pruning is an effective method of model compression to handle such problems. This paper presents a novel structured network pruning method with auxiliary gating structures which assigns importance marks to blocks in backbone network as a criterion when pruning. Block-wise pruning is then realized by proposed voting strategy, which is different from prevailing methods who prune a model in small granularity like channel-wise. We further develop a three-stage training scheduling for the proposed architecture incorporating knowledge distillation for better performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-arts compression performance for the classification tasks. In addition, our approach can integrate synergistically with other pruning methods by providing pretrained models, thus achieving a better performance than the unpruned model with over 93\% FLOPs reduced.      
### 68.Unified Chinese License Plate Detection and Recognition with High Efficiency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03582.pdf)
>  Recently, deep learning-based methods have reached an excellent performance on License Plate (LP) detection and recognition tasks. However, it is still challenging to build a robust model for Chinese LPs since there are not enough large and representative datasets. In this work, we propose a new dataset named Chinese Road Plate Dataset (CRPD) that contains multi-objective Chinese LP images as a supplement to the existing public benchmarks. The images are mainly captured with electronic monitoring systems with detailed annotations. To our knowledge, CRPD is the largest public multi-objective Chinese LP dataset with annotations of vertices. With CRPD, a unified detection and recognition network with high efficiency is presented as the baseline. The network is end-to-end trainable with totally real-time inference efficiency (30 fps with 640p). The experiments on several public benchmarks demonstrate that our method has reached competitive performance. The code and dataset will be publicly available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/yxgong0/CRPD" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 69.Utility-Oriented Underwater Image Quality Assessment Based on Transfer Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03574.pdf)
>  The widespread image applications have greatly promoted the vision-based tasks, in which the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) technique has become an increasingly significant issue. For user enjoyment in multimedia systems, the IQA exploits image fidelity and aesthetics to characterize user experience; while for other tasks such as popular object recognition, there exists a low correlation between utilities and perceptions. In such cases, the fidelity-based and aesthetics-based IQA methods cannot be directly applied. To address this issue, this paper proposes a utility-oriented IQA in object recognition. In particular, we initialize our research in the scenario of underwater fish detection, which is a critical task that has not yet been perfectly addressed. Based on this task, we build an Underwater Image Utility Database (UIUD) and a learning-based Underwater Image Utility Measure (UIUM). Inspired by the top-down design of fidelity-based IQA, we exploit the deep models of object recognition and transfer their features to our UIUM. Experiments validate that the proposed transfer-learning-based UIUM achieves promising performance in the recognition task. We envision our research provides insights to bridge the researches of IQA and computer vision.      
### 70.Representation Learning for Compressed Video Action Recognition via Attentive Cross-modal Interaction with Motion Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03569.pdf)
>  Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention, since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g., motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.      
### 71.Graph Fusion Network for Multi-Oriented Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03562.pdf)
>  In object detection, non-maximum suppression (NMS) methods are extensively adopted to remove horizontal duplicates of detected dense boxes for generating final object instances. However, due to the degraded quality of dense detection boxes and not explicit exploration of the context information, existing NMS methods via simple intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics tend to underperform on multi-oriented and long-size objects detection. Distinguishing with general NMS methods via duplicate removal, we propose a novel graph fusion network, named GFNet, for multi-oriented object detection. Our GFNet is extensible and adaptively fuse dense detection boxes to detect more accurate and holistic multi-oriented object instances. Specifically, we first adopt a locality-aware clustering algorithm to group dense detection boxes into different clusters. We will construct an instance sub-graph for the detection boxes belonging to one cluster. Then, we propose a graph-based fusion network via Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn to reason and fuse the detection boxes for generating final instance boxes. Extensive experiments both on public available multi-oriented text datasets (including MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015, ICDAR2017-MLT) and multi-oriented object datasets (DOTA) verify the effectiveness and robustness of our method against general NMS methods in multi-oriented object detection.      
### 72.Multi-Target Active Object Tracking with Monte Carlo Tree Search and Target Motion Modeling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03555.pdf)
>  In this work, we are dedicated to multi-target active object tracking (AOT), where there are multiple targets as well as multiple cameras in the environment. The goal is maximize the overall target coverage of all cameras. Previous work makes a strong assumption that each camera is fixed in a location and only allowed to rotate, which limits its application. In this work, we relax the setting by allowing all cameras to both move along the boundary lines and rotate. In our setting, the action space becomes much larger, which leads to much higher computational complexity to identify the optimal action. To this end, we propose to leverage the action selection from multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) network to prune the search tree of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method, so as to find the optimal action more efficiently. Besides, we model the motion of the targets to predict the future position of the targets, which makes a better estimation of the future environment state in the MCTS process. We establish a multi-target 2D environment to simulate the sports games, and experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the target coverage.      
### 73.From Heavy Rain Removal to Detail Restoration: A Faster and Better Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03553.pdf)
>  The dense rain accumulation in heavy rain can significantly wash out images and thus destroy the background details of images. Although existing deep rain removal models lead to improved performance for heavy rain removal, we find that most of them ignore the detail reconstruction accuracy of rain-free images. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage progressive enhancement network (DPENet) to achieve effective deraining with structure-accurate rain-free images. Two main modules are included in our framework, namely a rain streaks removal network (R$^2$Net) and a detail reconstruction network (DRNet). The former aims to achieve accurate rain removal, and the latter is designed to recover the details of rain-free images. We introduce two main strategies within our networks to achieve trade-off between the effectiveness of deraining and the detail restoration of rain-free images. Firstly, a dilated dense residual block (DDRB) within the rain streaks removal network is presented to aggregate high/low level features of heavy rain. Secondly, an enhanced residual pixel-wise attention block (ERPAB) within the detail reconstruction network is designed for context information aggregation. We also propose a comprehensive loss function to highlight the marginal and regional accuracy of rain-free images. Extensive experiments on benchmark public datasets show both efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving structure-preserving rain-free images for heavy rain removal.

### 74.Deep Learning-enabled Detection and Classification of Bacterial Colonies using a Thin Film Transistor (TFT) Image Sensor  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03549.pdf)
>  Early detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an essential task for public health. The conventional culture-based methods for bacterial colony detection usually take &gt;24 hours to get the final read-out. Here, we demonstrate a bacterial colony-forming-unit (CFU) detection system exploiting a thin-film-transistor (TFT)-based image sensor array that saves ~12 hours compared to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of this CFU detection system, a lensfree imaging modality was built using the TFT image sensor with a sample field-of-view of ~10 cm^2. Time-lapse images of bacterial colonies cultured on chromogenic agar plates were automatically collected at 5-minute intervals. Two deep neural networks were used to detect and count the growing colonies and identify their species. When blindly tested with 265 colonies of E. coli and other coliform bacteria (i.e., Citrobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae), our system reached an average CFU detection rate of 97.3% at 9 hours of incubation and an average recovery rate of 91.6% at ~12 hours. This TFT-based sensor can be applied to various microbiological detection methods. Due to the large scalability, ultra-large field-of-view, and low cost of the TFT-based image sensors, this platform can be integrated with each agar plate to be tested and disposed of after the automated CFU count. The imaging field-of-view of this platform can be cost-effectively increased to &gt;100 cm^2 to provide a massive throughput for CFU detection using, e.g., roll-to-roll manufacturing of TFTs as used in the flexible display industry.      
### 75.BiCo-Net: Regress Globally, Match Locally for Robust 6D Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03536.pdf)
>  The challenges of learning a robust 6D pose function lie in 1) severe occlusion and 2) systematic noises in depth images. Inspired by the success of point-pair features, the goal of this paper is to recover the 6D pose of an object instance segmented from RGB-D images by locally matching pairs of oriented points between the model and camera space. To this end, we propose a novel Bi-directional Correspondence Mapping Network (BiCo-Net) to first generate point clouds guided by a typical pose regression, which can thus incorporate pose-sensitive information to optimize generation of local coordinates and their normal vectors. As pose predictions via geometric computation only rely on one single pair of local oriented points, our BiCo-Net can achieve robustness against sparse and occluded point clouds. An ensemble of redundant pose predictions from locally matching and direct pose regression further refines final pose output against noisy observations. Experimental results on three popularly benchmarking datasets can verify that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance, especially for the more challenging severe occluded scenes.

### 76.Automatic segmentation of meniscus based on MAE self-supervision and point-line weak supervision paradigm  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03525.pdf)
>  Medical image segmentation based on deep learning is often faced with the problems of insufficient datasets and long time-consuming labeling. In this paper, we introduce the self-supervised method MAE(Masked Autoencoders) into knee joint images to provide a good initial weight for the segmentation model and improve the adaptability of the model to small datasets. Secondly, we propose a weakly supervised paradigm for meniscus segmentation based on the combination of point and line to reduce the time of labeling. Based on the weak label ,we design a region growing algorithm to generate pseudo-label. Finally we train the segmentation network based on pseudo-labels with weight transfer from self-supervision. Sufficient experimental results show that our proposed method combining self-supervision and weak supervision can almost approach the performance of purely fully supervised models while greatly reducing the required labeling time and dataset size.      
### 77.EVIMO2: An Event Camera Dataset for Motion Segmentation, Optical Flow, Structure from Motion, and Visual Inertial Odometry in Indoor Scenes with Monocular or Stereo Algorithms  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03467.pdf)
>  A new event camera dataset, EVIMO2, is introduced that improves on the popular EVIMO dataset by providing more data, from better cameras, in more complex scenarios. As with its predecessor, EVIMO2 provides labels in the form of per-pixel ground truth depth and segmentation as well as camera and object poses. All sequences use data from physical cameras and many sequences feature multiple independently moving objects. Typically, such labeled data is unavailable in physical event camera datasets. Thus, EVIMO2 will serve as a challenging benchmark for existing algorithms and rich training set for the development of new algorithms. In particular, EVIMO2 is suited for supporting research in motion and object segmentation, optical flow, structure from motion, and visual (inertial) odometry in both monocular or stereo configurations. <br>EVIMO2 consists of 41 minutes of data from three 640$\times$480 event cameras, one 2080$\times$1552 classical color camera, inertial measurements from two six axis inertial measurement units, and millimeter accurate object poses from a Vicon motion capture system. The dataset's 173 sequences are arranged into three categories. 3.75 minutes of independently moving household objects, 22.55 minutes of static scenes, and 14.85 minutes of basic motions in shallow scenes. Some sequences were recorded in low-light conditions where conventional cameras fail. Depth and segmentation are provided at 60 Hz for the event cameras and 30 Hz for the classical camera. The masks can be regenerated using open-source code up to rates as high as 200 Hz. <br>This technical report briefly describes EVIMO2. The full documentation is available online.

### 78.Comparative Analysis of Non-Blind Deblurring Methods for Noisy Blurred Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03464.pdf)
>  Image blurring refers to the degradation of an image wherein the image's overall sharpness decreases. Image blurring is caused by several factors. Additionally, during the image acquisition process, noise may get added to the image. Such a noisy and blurred image can be represented as the image resulting from the convolution of the original image with the associated point spread function, along with additive noise. However, the blurred image often contains inadequate information to uniquely determine the plausible original image. Based on the availability of blurring information, image deblurring methods can be classified as blind and non-blind. In non-blind image deblurring, some prior information is known regarding the corresponding point spread function and the added noise. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of non-blind image deblurring methods with respect to the identification and elimination of noise present in blurred images. In this study, three non-blind image deblurring methods, namely Wiener deconvolution, Lucy-Richardson deconvolution, and regularized deconvolution were comparatively analyzed for noisy images featuring salt-and-pepper noise. Two types of blurring effects were simulated, namely motion blurring and Gaussian blurring. The said three non-blind deblurring methods were applied under two scenarios: direct deblurring of noisy blurred images and deblurring of images after denoising through the application of the adaptive median filter. The obtained results were then compared for each scenario to determine the best approach for deblurring noisy images.      
### 79.LatentKeypointGAN: Controlling Images via Latent Keypoints -- Extended Abstract  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03448.pdf)
>  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can now generate photo-realistic images. However, how to best control the image content remains an open challenge. We introduce LatentKeypointGAN, a two-stage GAN internally conditioned on a set of keypoints and associated appearance embeddings providing control of the position and style of the generated objects and their respective parts. A major difficulty that we address is disentangling the image into spatial and appearance factors with little domain knowledge and supervision signals. We demonstrate in a user study and quantitative experiments that LatentKeypointGAN provides an interpretable latent space that can be used to re-arrange the generated images by re-positioning and exchanging keypoint embeddings, such as generating portraits by combining the eyes, and mouth from different images. Notably, our method does not require labels as it is self-supervised and thereby applies to diverse application domains, such as editing portraits, indoor rooms, and full-body human poses.      
### 80.EdgeViTs: Competing Light-weight CNNs on Mobile Devices with Vision Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03436.pdf)
>  Self-attention based models such as vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a very competitive architecture alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision. Despite increasingly stronger variants with ever-higher recognition accuracies, due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, existing ViTs are typically demanding in computation and model size. Although several successful design choices (e.g., the convolutions and hierarchical multi-stage structure) of prior CNNs have been reintroduced into recent ViTs, they are still not sufficient to meet the limited resource requirements of mobile devices. This motivates a very recent attempt to develop light ViTs based on the state-of-the-art MobileNet-v2, but still leaves a performance gap behind. In this work, pushing further along this under-studied direction we introduce EdgeViTs, a new family of light-weight ViTs that, for the first time, enable attention-based vision models to compete with the best light-weight CNNs in the tradeoff between accuracy and on-device efficiency. This is realized by introducing a highly cost-effective local-global-local (LGL) information exchange bottleneck based on optimal integration of self-attention and convolutions. For device-dedicated evaluation, rather than relying on inaccurate proxies like the number of FLOPs or parameters, we adopt a practical approach of focusing directly on on-device latency and, for the first time, energy efficiency. Specifically, we show that our models are Pareto-optimal when both accuracy-latency and accuracy-energy trade-offs are considered, achieving strict dominance over other ViTs in almost all cases and competing with the most efficient CNNs.      
### 81.OpenPodcar: an Open Source Vehicle for Self-Driving Car Research  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04454.pdf)
>  OpenPodcar is a low-cost, open source hardware and software, autonomous vehicle research platform based on an off-the-shelf, hard-canopy, mobility scooter donor vehicle. Hardware and software build instructions are provided to convert the donor vehicle into a low-cost and fully autonomous platform. The open platform consists of (a) hardware components: CAD designs, bill of materials, and build instructions; (b) Arduino, ROS and Gazebo control and simulation software files which provide standard ROS interfaces and simulation of the vehicle; and (c) higher-level ROS software implementations and configurations of standard robot autonomous planning and control, including the move_base interface with Timed-Elastic-Band planner which enacts commands to drive the vehicle from a current to a desired pose around obstacles. The vehicle is large enough to transport a human passenger or similar load at speeds up to 15km/h, for example for use as a last-mile autonomous taxi service or to transport delivery containers similarly around a city center. It is small and safe enough to be parked in a standard research lab and be used for realistic human-vehicle interaction studies. System build cost from new components is around USD7,000 in total in 2022. OpenPodcar thus provides a good balance between real world utility, safety, cost and research convenience.      
### 82.Activating More Pixels in Image Super-Resolution Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04437.pdf)
>  Transformer-based methods have shown impressive performance in low-level vision tasks, such as image super-resolution. However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for reconstruction, we propose a novel Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines channel attention and self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally propose a same-task pre-training strategy to bring further improvement. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed modules, and the overall method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by more than 1dB. Codes and models will be available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/chxy95/HAT" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 83.TeamX@DravidianLangTech-ACL2022: A Comparative Analysis for Troll-Based Meme Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04404.pdf)
>  The spread of fake news, propaganda, misinformation, disinformation, and harmful content online raised concerns among social media platforms, government agencies, policymakers, and society as a whole. This is because such harmful or abusive content leads to several consequences to people such as physical, emotional, relational, and financial. Among different harmful content \textit{trolling-based} online content is one of them, where the idea is to post a message that is provocative, offensive, or menacing with an intent to mislead the audience. The content can be textual, visual, a combination of both, or a meme. In this study, we provide a comparative analysis of troll-based memes classification using the textual, visual, and multimodal content. We report several interesting findings in terms of code-mixed text, multimodal setting, and combining an additional dataset, which shows improvements over the majority baseline.      
### 84.Detecting the Role of an Entity in Harmful Memes: Techniques and Their Limitations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04402.pdf)
>  Harmful or abusive online content has been increasing over time, raising concerns for social media platforms, government agencies, and policymakers. Such harmful or abusive content can have major negative impact on society, e.g., cyberbullying can lead to suicides, rumors about COVID-19 can cause vaccine hesitance, promotion of fake cures for COVID-19 can cause health harms and deaths. The content that is posted and shared online can be textual, visual, or a combination of both, e.g., in a meme. Here, we describe our experiments in detecting the roles of the entities (hero, villain, victim) in harmful memes, which is part of the CONSTRAINT-2022 shared task, as well as our system for the task. We further provide a comparative analysis of different experimental settings (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, attention, and augmentation). For reproducibility, we make our experimental code publicly available. \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/robi56/harmful_memes_block_fusion" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}      
### 85.FlowBot3D: Learning 3D Articulation Flow to Manipulate Articulated Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04382.pdf)
>  We explore a novel method to perceive and manipulate 3D articulated objects that generalizes to enable a robot to articulate unseen classes of objects. We propose a vision-based system that learns to predict the potential motions of the parts of a variety of articulated objects to guide downstream motion planning of the system to articulate the objects. To predict the object motions, we train a neural network to output a dense vector field representing the point-wise motion direction of the points in the point cloud under articulation. We then deploy an analytical motion planner based on this vector field to achieve a policy that yields maximum articulation. We train the vision system entirely in simulation, and we demonstrate the capability of our system to generalize to unseen object instances and novel categories in both simulation and the real world, deploying our policy on a Sawyer robot with no finetuning. Results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated and real-world experiments.      
### 86.Towards Measuring Domain Shift in Histopathological Stain Translation in an Unsupervised Manner  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04368.pdf)
>  Domain shift in digital histopathology can occur when different stains or scanners are used, during stain translation, etc. A deep neural network trained on source data may not generalise well to data that has undergone some domain shift. An important step towards being robust to domain shift is the ability to detect and measure it. This article demonstrates that the PixelCNN and domain shift metric can be used to detect and quantify domain shift in digital histopathology, and they demonstrate a strong correlation with generalisation performance. These findings pave the way for a mechanism to infer the average performance of a model (trained on source data) on unseen and unlabelled target data.      
### 87.Site Generalization: Stroke Lesion Segmentation on Magnetic Resonance Images from Unseen Sites  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04329.pdf)
>  There are considerable interests in automatic stroke lesion segmentation on magnetic resonance (MR) images in the medical imaging field, as strokes are the main cause of various cerebrovascular diseases. Although deep learning-based models have been proposed for this task, generalizing these models to unseen sites is difficult due to not only the large intersite discrepancy among different scanners, imaging protocols, and populations but also the variations in stroke lesion shape, size, and location. Thus, we propose a U-net--based segmentation network termed SG-Net to improve unseen site generalization for stroke lesion segmentation on MR images. Specifically, we first propose masked adaptive instance normalization (MAIN) to minimize intersite discrepancies, standardizing input MR images from different sites into a site-unrelated style by dynamically learning affine parameters from the input. Then, we leverage a gradient reversal layer to force the U-net encoder to learn site-invariant representation, which further improves the model generalization in conjunction with MAIN. Finally, inspired by the "pseudosymmetry" of the human brain, we introduce a simple, yet effective data augmentation technique that can be embedded within SG-Net to double the sample size while halving memory consumption. As a result, stroke lesions from the whole brain can be easily identified within a hemisphere, improving the simplicity of training. Experimental results on the benchmark Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) dataset, which includes MR images from 9 different sites, demonstrate that under the "leave-one-site-out" setting, the proposed SG-Net substantially outperforms recently published methods in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons.      
### 88.TGANet: Text-guided attention for improved polyp segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04280.pdf)
>  Colonoscopy is a gold standard procedure but is highly operator-dependent. Automated polyp segmentation, a precancerous precursor, can minimize missed rates and timely treatment of colon cancer at an early stage. Even though there are deep learning methods developed for this task, variability in polyp size can impact model training, thereby limiting it to the size attribute of the majority of samples in the training dataset that may provide sub-optimal results to differently sized polyps. In this work, we exploit size-related and polyp number-related features in the form of text attention during training. We introduce an auxiliary classification task to weight the text-based embedding that allows network to learn additional feature representations that can distinctly adapt to differently sized polyps and can adapt to cases with multiple polyps. Our experimental results demonstrate that these added text embeddings improve the overall performance of the model compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods. We explore four different datasets and provide insights for size-specific improvements. Our proposed text-guided attention network (TGANet) can generalize well to variable-sized polyps in different datasets.      
### 89.Detecting and Understanding Harmful Memes: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04274.pdf)
>  The automatic identification of harmful content online is of major concern for social media platforms, policymakers, and society. Researchers have studied textual, visual, and audio content, but typically in isolation. Yet, harmful content often combines multiple modalities, as in the case of memes, which are of particular interest due to their viral nature. With this in mind, here we offer a comprehensive survey with a focus on harmful memes. Based on a systematic analysis of recent literature, we first propose a new typology of harmful memes, and then we highlight and summarize the relevant state of the art. One interesting finding is that many types of harmful memes are not really studied, e.g., such featuring self-harm and extremism, partly due to the lack of suitable datasets. We further find that existing datasets mostly capture multi-class scenarios, which are not inclusive of the affective spectrum that memes can represent. Another observation is that memes can propagate globally through repackaging in different languages and that they can also be multilingual, blending different cultures. We conclude by highlighting several challenges related to multimodal semiotics, technological constraints and non-trivial social engagement, and we present several open-ended aspects such as delineating online harm and empirically examining related frameworks and assistive interventions, which we believe will motivate and drive future research.      
### 90.RCMNet: A deep learning model assists CAR-T therapy for leukemia  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04230.pdf)
>  Acute leukemia is a type of blood cancer with a high mortality rate. Current therapeutic methods include bone marrow transplantation, supportive therapy, and chemotherapy. Although a satisfactory remission of the disease can be achieved, the risk of recurrence is still high. Therefore, novel treatments are demanding. Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a promising approach to treat and cure acute leukemia. To harness the therapeutic potential of CAR-T cell therapy for blood diseases, reliable cell morphological identification is crucial. Nevertheless, the identification of CAR-T cells is a big challenge posed by their phenotypic similarity with other blood cells. To address this substantial clinical challenge, herein we first construct a CAR-T dataset with 500 original microscopy images after staining. Following that, we create a novel integrated model called RCMNet (ResNet18 with CBAM and MHSA) that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer. The model shows 99.63% top-1 accuracy on the public dataset. Compared with previous reports, our model obtains satisfactory results for image classification. Although testing on the CAR-T cells dataset, a decent performance is observed, which is attributed to the limited size of the dataset. Transfer learning is adapted for RCMNet and a maximum of 83.36% accuracy has been achieved, which is higher than other SOTA models. The study evaluates the effectiveness of RCMNet on a big public dataset and translates it to a clinical dataset for diagnostic applications.      
### 91.Mixed-UNet: Refined Class Activation Mapping for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Multi-scale Inference  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04227.pdf)
>  Deep learning techniques have shown great potential in medical image processing, particularly through accurate and reliable image segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or computed tomography (CT) scans, which allow the localization and diagnosis of lesions. However, training these segmentation models requires a large number of manually annotated pixel-level labels, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, in contrast to image-level labels that are easier to obtain. It is imperative to resolve this problem through weakly-supervised semantic segmentation models using image-level labels as supervision since it can significantly reduce human annotation efforts. Most of the advanced solutions exploit class activation mapping (CAM). However, the original CAMs rarely capture the precise boundaries of lesions. In this study, we propose the strategy of multi-scale inference to refine CAMs by reducing the detail loss in single-scale reasoning. For segmentation, we develop a novel model named Mixed-UNet, which has two parallel branches in the decoding phase. The results can be obtained after fusing the extracted features from two branches. We evaluate the designed Mixed-UNet against several prevalent deep learning-based segmentation approaches on our dataset collected from the local hospital and public datasets. The validation results demonstrate that our model surpasses available methods under the same supervision level in the segmentation of various lesions from brain imaging.      
### 92.NeuralHDHair: Automatic High-fidelity Hair Modeling from a Single Image Using Implicit Neural Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04175.pdf)
>  Undoubtedly, high-fidelity 3D hair plays an indispensable role in digital humans. However, existing monocular hair modeling methods are either tricky to deploy in digital systems (e.g., due to their dependence on complex user interactions or large databases) or can produce only a coarse geometry. In this paper, we introduce NeuralHDHair, a flexible, fully automatic system for modeling high-fidelity hair from a single image. The key enablers of our system are two carefully designed neural networks: an IRHairNet (Implicit representation for hair using neural network) for inferring high-fidelity 3D hair geometric features (3D orientation field and 3D occupancy field) hierarchically and a GrowingNet(Growing hair strands using neural network) to efficiently generate 3D hair strands in parallel. Specifically, we perform a coarse-to-fine manner and propose a novel voxel-aligned implicit function (VIFu) to represent the global hair feature, which is further enhanced by the local details extracted from a hair luminance map. To improve the efficiency of a traditional hair growth algorithm, we adopt a local neural implicit function to grow strands based on the estimated 3D hair geometric features. Extensive experiments show that our method is capable of constructing a high-fidelity 3D hair model from a single image, both efficiently and effectively, and achieves the-state-of-the-art performance.      
### 93.PS-Net: Deep Partially Separable Modelling for Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04073.pdf)
>  Deep learning methods driven by the low-rank regularization have achieved attractive performance in dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, most of these methods represent low-rank prior by hand-crafted nuclear norm, which cannot accurately approximate the low-rank prior over the entire dataset through a fixed regularization parameter. In this paper, we propose a learned low-rank method for dynamic MR imaging. In particular, we unrolled the semi-quadratic splitting method (HQS) algorithm for the partially separable (PS) model to a network, in which the low-rank is adaptively characterized by a learnable null-space transform. Experiments on the cardiac cine dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS) methods and existing deep learning methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.      
### 94.Augmentations: An Insight into their Effectiveness on Convolution Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04064.pdf)
>  Augmentations are the key factor in determining the performance of any neural network as they provide a model with a critical edge in boosting its performance. Their ability to boost a model's robustness depends on two factors, viz-a-viz, the model architecture, and the type of augmentations. Augmentations are very specific to a dataset, and it is not imperative that all kinds of augmentation would necessarily produce a positive effect on a model's performance. Hence there is a need to identify augmentations that perform consistently well across a variety of datasets and also remain invariant to the type of architecture, convolutions, and the number of parameters used. Hence there is a need to identify augmentations that perform consistently well across a variety of datasets and also remain invariant to the type of architecture, convolutions, and the number of parameters used. This paper evaluates the effect of parameters using 3x3 and depth-wise separable convolutions on different augmentation techniques on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. Statistical Evidence shows that techniques such as Cutouts and Random horizontal flip were consistent on both parametrically low and high architectures. Depth-wise separable convolutions outperformed 3x3 convolutions at higher parameters due to their ability to create deeper networks. Augmentations resulted in bridging the accuracy gap between the 3x3 and depth-wise separable convolutions, thus establishing their role in model generalization. At higher number augmentations did not produce a significant change in performance. The synergistic effect of multiple augmentations at higher parameters, with antagonistic effect at lower parameters, was also evaluated. The work proves that a delicate balance between architectural supremacy and augmentations needs to be achieved to enhance a model's performance in any given deep learning task.      
### 95.Masked Co-attentional Transformer reconstructs 100x ultra-fast/low-dose whole-body PET from longitudinal images and anatomically guided MRI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04044.pdf)
>  Despite its tremendous value for the diagnosis, treatment monitoring and surveillance of children with cancer, whole body staging with positron emission tomography (PET) is time consuming and associated with considerable radiation exposure. 100x (1% of the standard clinical dosage) ultra-low-dose/ultra-fast whole-body PET reconstruction has the potential for cancer imaging with unprecedented speed and improved safety, but it cannot be achieved by the naive use of machine learning techniques. In this study, we utilize the global similarity between baseline and follow-up PET and magnetic resonance (MR) images to develop Masked-LMCTrans, a longitudinal multi-modality co-attentional CNN-Transformer that provides interaction and joint reasoning between serial PET/MRs of the same patient. We mask the tumor area in the referenced baseline PET and reconstruct the follow-up PET scans. In this manner, Masked-LMCTrans reconstructs 100x almost-zero radio-exposure whole-body PET that was not possible before. The technique also opens a new pathway for longitudinal radiology imaging reconstruction, a significantly under-explored area to date. Our model was trained and tested with Stanford PET/MRI scans of pediatric lymphoma patients and evaluated externally on PET/MRI images from Tübingen University. The high image quality of the reconstructed 100x whole-body PET images resulting from the application of Masked-LMCTrans will substantially advance the development of safer imaging approaches and shorter exam-durations for pediatric patients, as well as expand the possibilities for frequent longitudinal monitoring of these patients by PET.      
### 96.Learning 6-DoF Object Poses to Grasp Category-level Objects by Language Instructions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04028.pdf)
>  This paper studies the task of any objects grasping from the known categories by free-form language instructions. This task demands the technique in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. We bring these disciplines together on this open challenge, which is essential to human-robot interaction. Critically, the key challenge lies in inferring the category of objects from linguistic instructions and accurately estimating the 6-DoF information of unseen objects from the known classes. In contrast, previous works focus on inferring the pose of object candidates at the instance level. This significantly limits its applications in real-world <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://scenarios.In" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> this paper, we propose a language-guided 6-DoF category-level object localization model to achieve robotic grasping by comprehending human intention. To this end, we propose a novel two-stage method. Particularly, the first stage grounds the target in the RGB image through language description of names, attributes, and spatial relations of objects. The second stage extracts and segments point clouds from the cropped depth image and estimates the full 6-DoF object pose at category-level. Under such a manner, our approach can locate the specific object by following human instructions, and estimate the full 6-DoF pose of a category-known but unseen instance which is not utilized for training the model. Extensive experimental results show that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art language-conditioned grasp method. Importantly, we deploy our approach on a physical robot to validate the usability of our framework in real-world applications. Please refer to the supplementary for the demo videos of our robot experiments.      
### 97.I Know What You Draw: Learning Grasp Detection Conditioned on a Few Freehand Sketches  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04026.pdf)
>  In this paper, we are interested in the problem of generating target grasps by understanding freehand sketches. The sketch is useful for the persons who cannot formulate language and the cases where a textual description is not available on the fly. However, very few works are aware of the usability of this novel interactive way between humans and robots. To this end, we propose a method to generate a potential grasp configuration relevant to the sketch-depicted objects. Due to the inherent ambiguity of sketches with abstract details, we take the advantage of the graph by incorporating the structure of the sketch to enhance the representation ability. This graph-represented sketch is further validated to improve the generalization of the network, capable of learning the sketch-queried grasp detection by using a small collection (around 100 samples) of hand-drawn sketches. Additionally, our model is trained and tested in an end-to-end manner which is easy to be implemented in real-world applications. Experiments on the multi-object VMRD and GraspNet-1Billion datasets demonstrate the good generalization of the proposed method. The physical robot experiments confirm the utility of our method in object-cluttered scenes.      
### 98.Photo-to-Shape Material Transfer for Diverse Structures  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04018.pdf)
>  We introduce a method for assigning photorealistic relightable materials to 3D shapes in an automatic manner. Our method takes as input a photo exemplar of a real object and a 3D object with segmentation, and uses the exemplar to guide the assignment of materials to the parts of the shape, so that the appearance of the resulting shape is as similar as possible to the exemplar. To accomplish this goal, our method combines an image translation neural network with a material assignment neural network. The image translation network translates the color from the exemplar to a projection of the 3D shape and the part segmentation from the projection to the exemplar. Then, the material prediction network assigns materials from a collection of realistic materials to the projected parts, based on the translated images and perceptual similarity of the materials. One key idea of our method is to use the translation network to establish a correspondence between the exemplar and shape projection, which allows us to transfer materials between objects with diverse structures. Another key idea of our method is to use the two pairs of (color, segmentation) images provided by the image translation to guide the material assignment, which enables us to ensure the consistency in the assignment. We demonstrate that our method allows us to assign materials to shapes so that their appearances better resemble the input exemplars, improving the quality of the results over the state-of-the-art method, and allowing us to automatically create thousands of shapes with high-quality photorealistic materials.

### 99.Row-wise Accelerator for Vision Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03998.pdf)
>  Following the success of the natural language processing, the transformer for vision applications has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its excellent performance. However, existing deep learning hardware accelerators for vision cannot execute this structure efficiently due to significant model architecture differences. As a result, this paper proposes the hardware accelerator for vision transformers with row-wise scheduling, which decomposes major operations in vision transformers as a single dot product primitive for a unified and efficient execution. Furthermore, by sharing weights in columns, we can reuse the data and reduce the usage of memory. The implementation with TSMC 40nm CMOS technology only requires 262K gate count and 149KB SRAM buffer for 403.2 GOPS throughput at 600MHz clock frequency.      
### 100.Hardware-Robust In-RRAM-Computing for Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03996.pdf)
>  In-memory computing is becoming a popular architecture for deep-learning hardware accelerators recently due to its highly parallel computing, low power, and low area cost. However, in-RRAM computing (IRC) suffered from large device variation and numerous nonideal effects in hardware. Although previous approaches including these effects in model training successfully improved variation tolerance, they only considered part of the nonideal effects and relatively simple classification tasks. This paper proposes a joint hardware and software optimization strategy to design a hardware-robust IRC macro for object detection. We lower the cell current by using a low word-line voltage to enable a complete convolution calculation in one operation that minimizes the impact of nonlinear addition. We also implement ternary weight mapping and remove batch normalization for better tolerance against device variation, sense amplifier variation, and IR drop problem. An extra bias is included to overcome the limitation of the current sensing range. The proposed approach has been successfully applied to a complex object detection task with only 3.85\% mAP drop, whereas a naive design suffers catastrophic failure under these nonideal effects.      
### 101.A Nonlocal Graph-PDE and Higher-Order Geometric Integration for Image Labeling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03991.pdf)
>  This paper introduces a novel nonlocal partial difference equation (PDE) for labeling metric data on graphs. The PDE is derived as nonlocal reparametrization of the assignment flow approach that was introduced in \textit{J.~Math.~Imaging \&amp; Vision} 58(2), 2017. Due to this parameterization, solving the PDE numerically is shown to be equivalent to computing the Riemannian gradient flow with respect to a nonconvex potential. We devise an entropy-regularized difference-of-convex-functions (DC) decomposition of this potential and show that the basic geometric Euler scheme for integrating the assignment flow is equivalent to solving the PDE by an established DC programming scheme. Moreover, the viewpoint of geometric integration reveals a basic way to exploit higher-order information of the vector field that drives the assignment flow, in order to devise a novel accelerated DC programming scheme. A detailed convergence analysis of both numerical schemes is provided and illustrated by numerical experiments.      
### 102.Private Eye: On the Limits of Textual Screen Peeking via Eyeglass Reflections in Video Conferencing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03971.pdf)
>  Personal video conferencing has become the new norm after COVID-19 caused a seismic shift from in-person meetings and phone calls to video conferencing for daily communications and sensitive business. Video leaks participants' on-screen information because eyeglasses and other reflective objects unwittingly expose partial screen contents. Using mathematical modeling and human subjects experiments, this research explores the extent to which emerging webcams might leak recognizable textual information gleamed from eyeglass reflections captured by webcams. The primary goal of our work is to measure, compute, and predict the factors, limits, and thresholds of recognizability as webcam technology evolves in the future. Our work explores and characterizes the viable threat models based on optical attacks using multi-frame super resolution techniques on sequences of video frames. Our experimental results and models show it is possible to reconstruct and recognize on-screen text with a height as small as 10 mm with a 720p webcam. We further apply this threat model to web textual content with varying attacker capabilities to find thresholds at which text becomes recognizable. Our user study with 20 participants suggests present-day 720p webcams are sufficient for adversaries to reconstruct textual content on big-font websites. Our models further show that the evolution toward 4K cameras will tip the threshold of text leakage to reconstruction of most header texts on popular websites. Our research proposes near-term mitigations, and justifies the importance of following the principle of least privilege for long-term defense against this attack. For privacy-sensitive scenarios, it's further recommended to develop technologies that blur all objects by default, then only unblur what is absolutely necessary to facilitate natural-looking conversations.      
### 103.Preservation of High Frequency Content for Deep Learning-Based Medical Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03898.pdf)
>  Chest radiographs are used for the diagnosis of multiple critical illnesses (e.g., Pneumonia, heart failure, lung cancer), for this reason, systems for the automatic or semi-automatic analysis of these data are of particular interest. An efficient analysis of large amounts of chest radiographs can aid physicians and radiologists, ultimately allowing for better medical care of lung-, heart- and chest-related conditions. We propose a novel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)-based method for the efficient identification and encoding of visual information that is typically lost in the down-sampling of high-resolution radiographs, a common step in computer-aided diagnostic pipelines. Our proposed approach requires only slight modifications to the input of existing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), making it easily applicable to existing image classification frameworks. We show that the extra high-frequency components offered by our method increased the classification performance of several CNNs in benchmarks employing the NIH Chest-8 and ImageNet-2017 datasets. Based on our results we hypothesize that providing frequency-specific coefficients allows the CNNs to specialize in the identification of structures that are particular to a frequency band, ultimately increasing classification performance, without an increase in computational load.

### 104.WKGM: Weight-K-space Generative Model for Parallel Imaging Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03883.pdf)
>  Parallel Imaging (PI) is one of the most im-portant and successful developments in accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently deep learning PI has emerged as an effective technique to accelerate MRI. Nevertheless, most approaches have so far been based image domain. In this work, we propose to explore the k-space domain via robust generative modeling for flexible PI reconstruction, coined weight-k-space generative model (WKGM). Specifically, WKGM is a generalized k-space domain model, where the k-space weighting technology and high-dimensional space strategy are efficiently incorporated for score-based generative model training, resulting in good and robust reconstruction. In addition, WKGM is flexible and thus can synergistically combine various traditional k-space PI models, generating learning-based priors to produce high-fidelity reconstructions. Experimental results on datasets with varying sampling patterns and acceleration factors demonstrate that WKGM can attain state-of-the-art reconstruction results under the well-learned k-space generative prior.      
### 105.Fast and Structured Block-Term Tensor Decomposition For Hyperspectral Unmixing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03798.pdf)
>  The block-term tensor decomposition model with multilinear rank-$(L_r,L_r,1)$ terms (or, the "LL1 tensor decomposition" in short) offers a valuable alternative for hyperspectral unmixing (HU) under the linear mixture model. Particularly, the LL1 decomposition ensures the endmember/abundance identifiability in scenarios where such guarantees are not supported by the classic matrix factorization (MF) approaches. However, existing LL1-based HU algorithms use a three-factor parameterization of the tensor (i.e., the hyperspectral image cube), which leads to a number of challenges including high per-iteration complexity, slow convergence, and difficulties in incorporating structural prior information. This work puts forth an LL1 tensor decomposition-based HU algorithm that uses a constrained two-factor re-parameterization of the tensor data. As a consequence, a two-block alternating gradient projection (GP)-based LL1 algorithm is proposed for HU. With carefully designed projection solvers, the GP algorithm enjoys a relatively low per-iteration complexity. Like in MF-based HU, the factors under our parameterization correspond to the endmembers and abundances. Thus, the proposed framework is natural to incorporate physics-motivated priors that arise in HU. The proposed algorithm often attains orders-of-magnitude speedup and substantial HU performance gains compared to the existing three-factor parameterization-based HU algorithms.      
### 106.Select and Calibrate the Low-confidence: Dual-Channel Consistency based Graph Convolutional Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03753.pdf)
>  The Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved excellent results in node classification tasks, but the model's performance at low label rates is still unsatisfactory. Previous studies in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) for graph have focused on using network predictions to generate soft pseudo-labels or instructing message propagation, which inevitably contains the incorrect prediction due to the over-confident in the predictions. Our proposed Dual-Channel Consistency based Graph Convolutional Networks (DCC-GCN) uses dual-channel to extract embeddings from node features and topological structures, and then achieves reliable low-confidence and high-confidence samples selection based on dual-channel consistency. We further confirmed that the low-confidence samples obtained based on dual-channel consistency were low in accuracy, constraining the model's performance. Unlike previous studies ignoring low-confidence samples, we calibrate the feature embeddings of the low-confidence samples by using the neighborhood's high-confidence samples. Our experiments have shown that the DCC-GCN can more accurately distinguish between low-confidence and high-confidence samples, and can also significantly improve the accuracy of low-confidence samples. We conducted extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets and demonstrated that DCC-GCN is significantly better than state-of-the-art baselines at different label rates.      
### 107.Decoupled-and-Coupled Networks: Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Subpixel Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03742.pdf)
>  Enormous efforts have been recently made to super-resolve hyperspectral (HS) images with the aid of high spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images. Most prior works usually perform the fusion task by means of multifarious pixel-level priors. Yet the intrinsic effects of a large distribution gap between HS-MS data due to differences in the spatial and spectral resolution are less investigated. The gap might be caused by unknown sensor-specific properties or highly-mixed spectral information within one pixel (due to low spatial resolution). To this end, we propose a subpixel-level HS super-resolution framework by devising a novel decoupled-and-coupled network, called DC-Net, to progressively fuse HS-MS information from the pixel- to subpixel-level, from the image- to feature-level. As the name suggests, DC-Net first decouples the input into common (or cross-sensor) and sensor-specific components to eliminate the gap between HS-MS images before further fusion, and then fully blends them by a model-guided coupled spectral unmixing (CSU) net. More significantly, we append a self-supervised learning module behind the CSU net by guaranteeing the material consistency to enhance the detailed appearances of the restored HS product. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method both visually and quantitatively and achieve a significant improvement in comparison with the state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, the codes and datasets will be available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://sites.google.com/view/danfeng-hong" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> for the sake of reproducibility.      
### 108.Category-Independent Articulated Object Tracking with Factor Graphs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03721.pdf)
>  Robots deployed in human-centric environments may need to manipulate a diverse range of articulated objects, such as doors, dishwashers, and cabinets. Articulated objects often come with unexpected articulation mechanisms that are inconsistent with categorical priors: for example, a drawer might rotate about a hinge joint instead of sliding open. We propose a category-independent framework for predicting the articulation models of unknown objects from sequences of RGB-D images. The prediction is performed by a two-step process: first, a visual perception module tracks object part poses from raw images, and second, a factor graph takes these poses and infers the articulation model including the current configuration between the parts as a 6D twist. We also propose a manipulation-oriented metric to evaluate predicted joint twists in terms of how well a compliant robot controller would be able to manipulate the articulated object given the predicted twist. We demonstrate that our visual perception and factor graph modules outperform baselines on simulated data and show the applicability of our factor graph on real world data.      
### 109.Block Modulating Video Compression: An Ultra Low Complexity Image Compression Encoder for Resource Limited Platforms  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03677.pdf)
>  We consider the image and video compression on resource limited platforms. An ultra low-cost image encoder, named Block Modulating Video Compression (BMVC) with an encoding complexity ${\cal O}(1)$ is proposed to be implemented on mobile platforms with low consumption of power and computation resources. We also develop two types of BMVC decoders, implemented by deep neural networks. The first BMVC decoder is based on the Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm, which is flexible to different compression ratios. And the second decoder is a memory efficient end-to-end convolutional neural network, which aims for real-time decoding. Extensive results on the high definition images and videos demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed codec and the robustness against bit quantization.      
### 110.Towards Robust 3D Object Recognition with Dense-to-Sparse Deep Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03654.pdf)
>  Three-dimensional (3D) object recognition is crucial for intelligent autonomous agents such as autonomous vehicles and robots alike to operate effectively in unstructured environments. Most state-of-art approaches rely on relatively dense point clouds and performance drops significantly for sparse point clouds. Unsupervised domain adaption allows to minimise the discrepancy between dense and sparse point clouds with minimal unlabelled sparse point clouds, thereby saving additional sparse data collection, annotation and retraining costs. In this work, we propose a novel method for point cloud based object recognition with competitive performance with state-of-art methods on dense and sparse point clouds while being trained only with dense point clouds.      
### 111.Label Adversarial Learning for Skeleton-level to Pixel-level Adjustable Vessel Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03646.pdf)
>  You can have your cake and eat it too. Microvessel segmentation in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images remains challenging. Skeleton-level segmentation shows clear topology but without diameter information, while pixel-level segmentation shows a clear caliber but low topology. To close this gap, we propose a novel label adversarial learning (LAL) for skeleton-level to pixel-level adjustable vessel segmentation. LAL mainly consists of two designs: a label adversarial loss and an embeddable adjustment layer. The label adversarial loss establishes an adversarial relationship between the two label supervisions, while the adjustment layer adjusts the network parameters to match the different adversarial weights. Such a design can efficiently capture the variation between the two supervisions, making the segmentation continuous and tunable. This continuous process allows us to recommend high-quality vessel segmentation with clear caliber and topology. Experimental results show that our results outperform manual annotations of current public datasets and conventional filtering effects. Furthermore, such a continuous process can also be used to generate an uncertainty map representing weak vessel boundaries and noise.      
### 112.Ultra-fast image categorization in vivo and in silico  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03635.pdf)
>  Humans are able to robustly categorize images and can, for instance, detect the presence of an animal in a briefly flashed image in as little as 120 ms. Initially inspired by neuroscience, deep-learning algorithms literally bloomed up in the last decade such that the accuracy of machines is at present superior to humans for visual recognition tasks. However, these artificial networks are usually trained and evaluated on very specific tasks, for instance on the 1000 separate categories of ImageNet. In that regard, biological visual systems are more flexible and efficient compared to artificial systems on generic ecological tasks. In order to deepen this comparison, we re-trained the standard VGG Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on two independent tasks which are ecologically relevant for humans: one task defined as detecting the presence of an animal and the other as detecting the presence of an artifact. We show that retraining the network achieves human-like performance level which is reported in psychophysical tasks. We also compare the accuracy of the detection on an image-by-image basis. This showed in particular that the two models perform better when combining their outputs. Indeed, animals (e.g. lions) tend to be less present in photographs containing artifacts (e.g. buildings). These re-trained models could reproduce some unexpected behavioral observations from humans psychophysics such as the robustness to rotations (e.g. upside-down or slanted image) or to a grayscale transformation.      
### 113.Deep Quality Assessment of Compressed Videos: A Subjective and Objective Study  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03630.pdf)
>  In the video coding process, the perceived quality of a compressed video is evaluated by full-reference quality evaluation metrics. However, it is difficult to obtain reference videos with perfect quality. To solve this problem, it is critical to design no-reference compressed video quality assessment algorithms, which assists in measuring the quality of experience on the server side and resource allocation on the network side. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown its advantage in Video Quality Assessment (VQA) with promising successes in recent years. A large-scale quality database is very important for learning accurate and powerful compressed video quality metrics. In this work, a semi-automatic labeling method is adopted to build a large-scale compressed video quality database, which allows us to label a large number of compressed videos with manageable human workload. The resulting Compressed Video quality database with Semi-Automatic Ratings (CVSAR), so far the largest of compressed video quality database. We train a no-reference compressed video quality assessment model with a 3D CNN for SpatioTemporal Feature Extraction and Evaluation (STFEE). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art metrics and achieves promising generalization performance in cross-database tests. The CVSAR database and STFEE model will be made publicly available to facilitate reproducible research.      
### 114.Multi-View Video Coding with GAN Latent Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03599.pdf)
>  The introduction of multiple viewpoints inevitably increases the bitrates to store and transmit video scenes. To reduce the compressed bitrates, researchers have developed to skip intermediate viewpoints during compression and delivery, and finally reconstruct them with Side Information (SI). Generally, the depth maps can be utilized to construct SI; however, it shows inferior performance with inaccurate reconstruction or high bitrates. In this paper, we propose a multi-view video coding based on SI of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). At the encoder, we construct a spatio-temporal Epipolar Plane Image (EPI) and further utilize convolutional network to extract the latent code of GAN as SI; while at the decoder side, we combine the SI and adjacent viewpoints to reconstruct intermediate views by the generator of GAN. In particular, we set a joint encoder constraint of reconstruction cost and SI entropy, in order to achieve an optimal tradeoff between reconstruction quality and bitrate overhead. Experiments show a significantly improved Rate-Distortion (RD) performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 115.Efficient VVC Intra Prediction Based on Deep Feature Fusion and Probability Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03587.pdf)
>  The ever-growing multimedia traffic has underscored the importance of effective multimedia codecs. Among them, the up-to-date lossy video coding standard, Versatile Video Coding (VVC), has been attracting attentions of video coding community. However, the gain of VVC is achieved at the cost of significant encoding complexity, which brings the need to realize fast encoder with comparable Rate Distortion (RD) performance. In this paper, we propose to optimize the VVC complexity at intra-frame prediction, with a two-stage framework of deep feature fusion and probability estimation. At the first stage, we employ the deep convolutional network to extract the spatialtemporal neighboring coding features. Then we fuse all reference features obtained by different convolutional kernels to determine an optimal intra coding depth. At the second stage, we employ a probability-based model and the spatial-temporal coherence to select the candidate partition modes within the optimal coding depth. Finally, these selected depths and partitions are executed whilst unnecessary computations are excluded. Experimental results on standard database demonstrate the superiority of proposed method, especially for High Definition (HD) and Ultra-HD (UHD) video sequences.      
### 116.SPQE: Structure-and-Perception-Based Quality Evaluation for Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03584.pdf)
>  The image Super-Resolution (SR) technique has greatly improved the visual quality of images by enhancing their resolutions. It also calls for an efficient SR Image Quality Assessment (SR-IQA) to evaluate those algorithms or their generated images. In this paper, we focus on the SR-IQA under deep learning and propose a Structure-and-Perception-based Quality Evaluation (SPQE). In emerging deep-learning-based SR, a generated high-quality, visually pleasing image may have different structures from its corresponding low-quality image. In such case, how to balance the quality scores between no-reference perceptual quality and referenced structural similarity is a critical issue. To help ease this problem, we give a theoretical analysis on this tradeoff and further calculate adaptive weights for the two types of quality scores. We also propose two deep-learning-based regressors to model the no-reference and referenced scores. By combining the quality scores and their weights, we propose a unified SPQE metric for SR-IQA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in different datasets.      
### 117.Bandits for Structure Perturbation-based Black-box Attacks to Graph Neural Networks with Theoretical Guarantees  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03546.pdf)
>  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many graph-based tasks such as node classification and graph classification. However, many recent works have demonstrated that an attacker can mislead GNN models by slightly perturbing the graph structure. Existing attacks to GNNs are either under the less practical threat model where the attacker is assumed to access the GNN model parameters, or under the practical black-box threat model but consider perturbing node features that are shown to be not enough effective. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and consider black-box attacks to GNNs with structure perturbation as well as with theoretical guarantees. We propose to address this challenge through bandit techniques. Specifically, we formulate our attack as an online optimization with bandit feedback. This original problem is essentially NP-hard due to the fact that perturbing the graph structure is a binary optimization problem. We then propose an online attack based on bandit optimization which is proven to be {sublinear} to the query number $T$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}T^{3/4})$ where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph. Finally, we evaluate our proposed attack by conducting experiments over multiple datasets and GNN models. The experimental results on various citation graphs and image graphs show that our attack is both effective and efficient.

### 118.Attract me to Buy: Advertisement Copywriting Generation with Multimodal Multi-structured Information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03534.pdf)
>  Recently, online shopping has gradually become a common way of shopping for people all over the world. Wonderful merchandise advertisements often attract more people to buy. These advertisements properly integrate multimodal multi-structured information of commodities, such as visual spatial information and fine-grained structure information. However, traditional multimodal text generation focuses on the conventional description of what existed and happened, which does not match the requirement of advertisement copywriting in the real world. Because advertisement copywriting has a vivid language style and higher requirements of faithfulness. Unfortunately, there is a lack of reusable evaluation frameworks and a scarcity of datasets. Therefore, we present a dataset, E-MMAD (e-commercial multimodal multi-structured advertisement copywriting), which requires, and supports much more detailed information in text generation. Noticeably, it is one of the largest video captioning datasets in this field. Accordingly, we propose a baseline method and faithfulness evaluation metric on the strength of structured information reasoning to solve the demand in reality on this dataset. It surpasses the previous methods by a large margin on all metrics. The dataset and method are coming soon on \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://e-mmad.github.io/e-mmad.net/index.html" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 119.Dual Adversarial Adaptation for Cross-Device Real-World Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03524.pdf)
>  Due to the sophisticated imaging process, an identical scene captured by different cameras could exhibit distinct imaging patterns, introducing distinct proficiency among the super-resolution (SR) models trained on images from different devices. In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical task coded cross-device SR, which strives to adapt a real-world SR model trained on the paired images captured by one camera to low-resolution (LR) images captured by arbitrary target devices. The proposed task is highly challenging due to the absence of paired data from various imaging devices. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation mechanism for real-world SR, named Dual ADversarial Adaptation (DADA), which only requires LR images in the target domain with available real paired data from a source camera. DADA employs the Domain-Invariant Attention (DIA) module to establish the basis of target model training even without HR supervision. Furthermore, the dual framework of DADA facilitates an Inter-domain Adversarial Adaptation (InterAA) in one branch for two LR input images from two domains, and an Intra-domain Adversarial Adaptation (IntraAA) in two branches for an LR input image. InterAA and IntraAA together improve the model transferability from the source domain to the target. We empirically conduct experiments under six Real to Real adaptation settings among three different cameras, and achieve superior performance compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also evaluate the proposed DADA to address the adaptation to the video camera, which presents a promising research topic to promote the wide applications of real-world super-resolution.

### 120.Optimizing Terrain Mapping and Landing Site Detection for Autonomous UAVs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03522.pdf)
>  The next generation of Mars rotorcrafts requires on-board autonomous hazard avoidance landing. To this end, this work proposes a system that performs continuous multi-resolution height map reconstruction and safe landing spot detection. Structure-from-Motion measurements are aggregated in a pyramid structure using a novel Optimal Mixture of Gaussians formulation that provides a comprehensive uncertainty model. Our multiresolution pyramid is built more efficiently and accurately than past work by decoupling pyramid filling from the measurement updates of different resolutions. To detect the safest landing location, after an optimized hazard segmentation, we use a mean shift algorithm on multiple distance transform peaks to account for terrain roughness and uncertainty. The benefits of our contributions are evaluated on real and synthetic flight data.      
### 121.Good Visual Guidance Makes A Better Extractor: Hierarchical Visual Prefix for Multimodal Entity and Relation Extraction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03521.pdf)
>  Multimodal named entity recognition and relation extraction (MNER and MRE) is a fundamental and crucial branch in information extraction. However, existing approaches for MNER and MRE usually suffer from error sensitivity when irrelevant object images incorporated in texts. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Prefix fusion NeTwork (HVPNeT) for visual-enhanced entity and relation extraction, aiming to achieve more effective and robust performance. Specifically, we regard visual representation as pluggable visual prefix to guide the textual representation for error insensitive forecasting decision. We further propose a dynamic gated aggregation strategy to achieve hierarchical multi-scaled visual features as visual prefix for fusion. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

### 122.Unsupervised Deep Unrolled Reconstruction Using Regularization by Denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03519.pdf)
>  Deep learning methods have been successfully used in various computer vision tasks. Inspired by that success, deep learning has been explored in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. In particular, integrating deep learning and model-based optimization methods has shown considerable advantages. However, a large amount of labeled training data is typically needed for high reconstruction quality, which is challenging for some MRI applications. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction method, named DURED-Net, that enables interpretable unsupervised learning for MR image reconstruction by combining an unsupervised denoising network and a plug-and-play method. We aim to boost the reconstruction performance of unsupervised learning by adding an explicit prior that utilizes imaging physics. Specifically, the leverage of a denoising network for MRI reconstruction is achieved using Regularization by Denoising (RED). Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method requires a reduced amount of training data to achieve high reconstruction quality.      
### 123.Norm-Scaling for Out-of-Distribution Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03493.pdf)
>  Out-of-Distribution (OoD) inputs are examples that do not belong to the true underlying distribution of the dataset. Research has shown that deep neural nets make confident mispredictions on OoD inputs. Therefore, it is critical to identify OoD inputs for safe and reliable deployment of deep neural nets. Often a threshold is applied on a similarity score to detect OoD inputs. One such similarity is angular similarity which is the dot product of latent representation with the mean class representation. Angular similarity encodes uncertainty, for example, if the angular similarity is less, it is less certain that the input belongs to that class. However, we observe that, different classes have different distributions of angular similarity. Therefore, applying a single threshold for all classes is not ideal since the same similarity score represents different uncertainties for different classes. In this paper, we propose norm-scaling which normalizes the logits separately for each class. This ensures that a single value consistently represents similar uncertainty for various classes. We show that norm-scaling, when used with maximum softmax probability detector, achieves 9.78% improvement in AUROC, 5.99% improvement in AUPR and 33.19% reduction in FPR95 metrics over previous state-of-the-art methods.      
### 124.Global Multi-modal 2D/3D Registration via Local Descriptors Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03439.pdf)
>  Multi-modal registration is a required step for many image-guided procedures, especially ultrasound-guided interventions that require anatomical context. While a number of such registration algorithms are already available, they all require a good initialization to succeed due to the challenging appearance of ultrasound images and the arbitrary coordinate system they are acquired in. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the problem of registration of an ultrasound sweep to a pre-operative image. We learn dense keypoint descriptors from which we then estimate the registration. We show that our method overcomes the challenges inherent to registration tasks with freehand ultrasound sweeps, namely, the multi-modality and multidimensionality of the data in addition to lack of precise ground truth and low amounts of training examples. We derive a registration method that is fast, generic, fully automatic, does not require any initialization and can naturally generate visualizations aiding interpretability and explainability. Our approach is evaluated on a clinical dataset of paired MR volumes and ultrasound sequences.      
### 125.VFHQ: A High-Quality Dataset and Benchmark for Video Face Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03409.pdf)
>  Most of the existing video face super-resolution (VFSR) methods are trained and evaluated on VoxCeleb1, which is designed specifically for speaker identification and the frames in this dataset are of low quality. As a consequence, the VFSR models trained on this dataset can not output visual-pleasing results. In this paper, we develop an automatic and scalable pipeline to collect a high-quality video face dataset (VFHQ), which contains over $16,000$ high-fidelity clips of diverse interview scenarios. To verify the necessity of VFHQ, we further conduct experiments and demonstrate that VFSR models trained on our VFHQ dataset can generate results with sharper edges and finer textures than those trained on VoxCeleb1. In addition, we show that the temporal information plays a pivotal role in eliminating video consistency issues as well as further improving visual performance. Based on VFHQ, by analyzing the benchmarking study of several state-of-the-art algorithms under bicubic and blind settings.

### 126.A High-Resolution Chest CT-Scan Image Dataset for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Differentiation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03408.pdf)
>  During the COVID-19 pandemic, computed tomography (CT) is a good way to diagnose COVID-19 patients. HRCT (High-Resolution Computed Tomography) is a form of computed tomography that uses advanced methods to improve image resolution. Publicly accessible COVID-19 CT image datasets are very difficult to come by due to privacy concerns, which impedes the study and development of AI-powered COVID-19 diagnostic algorithms based on CT images. To address this problem, we have introduced HRCTv1-COVID-19, a new COVID-19 high resolution chest CT Scan image dataset that includes not only COVID-19 cases of Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), Crazy Paving, and Air Space Consolidation, but also CT images of cases with negative COVID-19. The HRCTv1-COVID-19 dataset, which includes slice-level, and patient-level labels, has the potential to aid COVID-19 research, especially for diagnosis and differentiation using artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning and deep learning methods. This dataset is accessible through web at: <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://databiox.com" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> and includes 181,106 chest HRCT images from 395 patients with four labels: GGO, Crazy Paving, Air Space Consolidation and Negative. <br>Keywords- Dataset, COVID-19, CT-Scan, Computed Tomography, Medical Imaging, Chest Image.
