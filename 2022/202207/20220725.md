### 1.Panoptic Scene Graph Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11247.pdf)
>  Existing research addresses scene graph generation (SGG) -- a critical technology for scene understanding in images -- from a detection perspective, i.e., objects are detected using bounding boxes followed by prediction of their pairwise relationships. We argue that such a paradigm causes several problems that impede the progress of the field. For instance, bounding box-based labels in current datasets usually contain redundant classes like hairs, and leave out background information that is crucial to the understanding of context. In this work, we introduce panoptic scene graph generation (PSG), a new problem task that requires the model to generate a more comprehensive scene graph representation based on panoptic segmentations rather than rigid bounding boxes. A high-quality PSG dataset, which contains 49k well-annotated overlapping images from COCO and Visual Genome, is created for the community to keep track of its progress. For benchmarking, we build four two-stage baselines, which are modified from classic methods in SGG, and two one-stage baselines called PSGTR and PSGFormer, which are based on the efficient Transformer-based detector, i.e., DETR. While PSGTR uses a set of queries to directly learn triplets, PSGFormer separately models the objects and relations in the form of queries from two Transformer decoders, followed by a prompting-like relation-object matching mechanism. In the end, we share insights on open challenges and future directions.      
### 2.Deep Learning Hyperparameter Optimization for Breast Mass Detection in Mammograms  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11244.pdf)
>  Accurate breast cancer diagnosis through mammography has the potential to save millions of lives around the world. Deep learning (DL) methods have shown to be very effective for mass detection in mammograms. Additional improvements of current DL models will further improve the effectiveness of these methods. A critical issue in this context is how to pick the right hyperparameters for DL models. In this paper, we present GA-E2E, a new approach for tuning the hyperparameters of DL models for brest cancer detection using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Our findings reveal that differences in parameter values can considerably alter the area under the curve (AUC), which is used to determine a classifier's performance.      
### 3.Multiface: A Dataset for Neural Face Rendering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11243.pdf)
>  Photorealistic avatars of human faces have come a long way in recent years, yet research along this area is limited by a lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets covering both, dense multi-view camera captures, and rich facial expressions of the captured subjects. In this work, we present Multiface, a new multi-view, high-resolution human face dataset collected from 13 identities at Reality Labs Research for neural face rendering. We introduce Mugsy, a large scale multi-camera apparatus to capture high-resolution synchronized videos of a facial performance. The goal of Multiface is to close the gap in accessibility to high quality data in the academic community and to enable research in VR telepresence. Along with the release of the dataset, we conduct ablation studies on the influence of different model architectures toward the model's interpolation capacity of novel viewpoint and expressions. With a conditional VAE model serving as our baseline, we found that adding spatial bias, texture warp field, and residual connections improves performance on novel view synthesis.

### 4.Improved lightweight identification of agricultural diseases based on MobileNetV3  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11238.pdf)
>  At present, the identification of agricultural pests and diseases has the problem that the model is not lightweight enough and difficult to apply. Based on MobileNetV3, this paper introduces the Coordinate Attention block. The parameters of MobileNetV3-large are reduced by 22%, the model size is reduced by 19.7%, and the accuracy is improved by 0.92%. The parameters of MobileNetV3-small are reduced by 23.4%, the model size is reduced by 18.3%, and the accuracy is increased by 0.40%. In addition, the improved MobileNetV3-small was migrated to Jetson Nano for testing. The accuracy increased by 2.48% to 98.31%, and the inference speed increased by 7.5%. It provides a reference for deploying the agricultural pest identification model to embedded devices.      
### 5.A System-driven Automatic Ground Truth Generation Method for DL Inner-City Driving Corridor Detectors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11234.pdf)
>  Data-driven perception approaches are well-established in automated driving systems. In many fields even super-human performance is reached. Unlike prediction and planning approaches, mainly supervised learning algorithms are used for the perception domain. Therefore, a major remaining challenge is the efficient generation of ground truth data. As perception modules are positioned close to the sensor, they typically run on raw sensor data of high bandwidth. Due to that, the generation of ground truth labels typically causes a significant manual effort, which leads to high costs for the labelling itself and the necessary quality control. In this contribution, we propose an automatic labeling approach for semantic segmentation of the drivable ego corridor that reduces the manual effort by a factor of 150 and more. The proposed holistic approach could be used in an automated data loop, allowing a continuous improvement of the depending perception modules.      
### 6.Seeing 3D Objects in a Single Image via Self-Supervised Static-Dynamic Disentanglement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11232.pdf)
>  Human perception reliably identifies movable and immovable parts of 3D scenes, and completes the 3D structure of objects and background from incomplete observations. We learn this skill not via labeled examples, but simply by observing objects move. In this work, we propose an approach that observes unlabeled multi-view videos at training time and learns to map a single image observation of a complex scene, such as a street with cars, to a 3D neural scene representation that is disentangled into movable and immovable parts while plausibly completing its 3D structure. We separately parameterize movable and immovable scene parts via 2D neural ground plans. These ground plans are 2D grids of features aligned with the ground plane that can be locally decoded into 3D neural radiance fields. Our model is trained self-supervised via neural rendering. We demonstrate that the structure inherent to our disentangled 3D representation enables a variety of downstream tasks in street-scale 3D scenes using simple heuristics, such as extraction of object-centric 3D representations, novel view synthesis, instance segmentation, and 3D bounding box prediction, highlighting its value as a backbone for data-efficient 3D scene understanding models. This disentanglement further enables scene editing via object manipulation such as deletion, insertion, and rigid-body motion.      
### 7.You Actually Look Twice At it (YALTAi): using an object detection approach instead of region segmentation within the Kraken engine  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11230.pdf)
>  Layout Analysis (the identification of zones and their classification) is the first step along line segmentation in Optical Character Recognition and similar tasks. The ability of identifying main body of text from marginal text or running titles makes the difference between extracting the work full text of a digitized book and noisy outputs. We show that most segmenters focus on pixel classification and that polygonization of this output has not been used as a target for the latest competition on historical document (ICDAR 2017 and onwards), despite being the focus in the early 2010s. We propose to shift, for efficiency, the task from a pixel classification-based polygonization to an object detection using isothetic rectangles. We compare the output of Kraken and YOLOv5 in terms of segmentation and show that the later severely outperforms the first on small datasets (1110 samples and below). We release two datasets for training and evaluation on historical documents as well as a new package, YALTAi, which injects YOLOv5 in the segmentation pipeline of Kraken 4.1.      
### 8.Classifying Crop Types using Gaussian Bayesian Models and Neural Networks on GHISACONUS USGS data from NASA Hyperspectral Satellite Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11228.pdf)
>  Hyperspectral Imagining is a type of digital imaging in which each pixel contains typically hundreds of wavelengths of light providing spectroscopic information about the materials present in the pixel. In this paper we provide classification methods for determining crop type in the USGS GHISACONUS data, which contains around 7,000 pixel spectra from the five major U.S. agricultural crops (winter wheat, rice, corn, soybeans, and cotton) collected by the NASA Hyperion satellite, and includes the spectrum, geolocation, crop type, and stage of growth for each pixel. We apply standard LDA and QDA as well as Bayesian custom versions that compute the joint probability of crop type and stage, and then the marginal probability for crop type, outperforming the non-Bayesian methods. We also test a single layer neural network with dropout on the data, which performs comparable to LDA and QDA but not as well as the Bayesian methods.      
### 9.Face editing with GAN -- A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11227.pdf)
>  In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a hot topic among researchers and engineers that work with deep learning. It has been a ground-breaking technique which can generate new pieces of content of data in a consistent way. The topic of GANs has exploded in popularity due to its applicability in fields like image generation and synthesis, and music production and composition. GANs have two competing neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is used to produce new samples or pieces of content, while the discriminator is used to recognize whether the piece of content is real or generated. What makes it different from other generative models is its ability to learn unlabeled samples. In this review paper, we will discuss the evolution of GANs, several improvements proposed by the authors and a brief comparison between the different models. Index Terms generative adversarial networks, unsupervised learning, deep learning.      
### 10.FewGAN: Generating from the Joint Distribution of a Few Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11226.pdf)
>  We introduce FewGAN, a generative model for generating novel, high-quality and diverse images whose patch distribution lies in the joint patch distribution of a small number of N&gt;1 training samples. The method is, in essence, a hierarchical patch-GAN that applies quantization at the first coarse scale, in a similar fashion to VQ-GAN, followed by a pyramid of residual fully convolutional GANs at finer scales. Our key idea is to first use quantization to learn a fixed set of patch embeddings for training images. We then use a separate set of side images to model the structure of generated images using an autoregressive model trained on the learned patch embeddings of training images. Using quantization at the coarsest scale allows the model to generate both conditional and unconditional novel images. Subsequently, a patch-GAN renders the fine details, resulting in high-quality images. In an extensive set of experiments, it is shown that FewGAN outperforms baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively.      
### 11.Forest and Water Bodies Segmentation Through Satellite Images Using U-Net  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11222.pdf)
>  Global environment monitoring is a task that requires additional attention in the contemporary rapid climate change environment. This includes monitoring the rate of deforestation and areas affected by flooding. Satellite imaging has greatly helped monitor the earth, and deep learning techniques have helped to automate this monitoring process. This paper proposes a solution for observing the area covered by the forest and water. To achieve this task UNet model has been proposed, which is an image segmentation model. The model achieved a validation accuracy of 82.55% and 82.92% for the segmentation of areas covered by forest and water, respectively.      
### 12.Domain Generalization for Activity Recognition via Adaptive Feature Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11221.pdf)
>  Human activity recognition requires the efforts to build a generalizable model using the training datasets with the hope to achieve good performance in test datasets. However, in real applications, the training and testing datasets may have totally different distributions due to various reasons such as different body shapes, acting styles, and habits, damaging the model's generalization performance. While such a distribution gap can be reduced by existing domain adaptation approaches, they typically assume that the test data can be accessed in the training stage, which is not realistic. In this paper, we consider a more practical and challenging scenario: domain-generalized activity recognition (DGAR) where the test dataset \emph{cannot} be accessed during training. To this end, we propose \emph{Adaptive Feature Fusion for Activity Recognition~(AFFAR)}, a domain generalization approach that learns to fuse the domain-invariant and domain-specific representations to improve the model's generalization performance. AFFAR takes the best of both worlds where domain-invariant representations enhance the transferability across domains and domain-specific representations leverage the model discrimination power from each domain. Extensive experiments on three public HAR datasets show its effectiveness. Furthermore, we apply AFFAR to a real application, i.e., the diagnosis of Children's Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder~(ADHD), which also demonstrates the superiority of our approach.      
### 13.Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Entropy-Regularized Data-Free Replay  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11213.pdf)
>  Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) has been proposed aiming to enable a deep learning system to incrementally learn new classes with limited data. Recently, a pioneer claims that the commonly used replay-based method in class-incremental learning (CIL) is ineffective and thus not preferred for FSCIL. This has, if truth, a significant influence on the fields of FSCIL. In this paper, we show through empirical results that adopting the data replay is surprisingly favorable. However, storing and replaying old data can lead to a privacy concern. To address this issue, we alternatively propose using data-free replay that can synthesize data by a generator without accessing real data. In observing the the effectiveness of uncertain data for knowledge distillation, we impose entropy regularization in the generator training to encourage more uncertain examples. Moreover, we propose to relabel the generated data with one-hot-like labels. This modification allows the network to learn by solely minimizing the cross-entropy loss, which mitigates the problem of balancing different objectives in the conventional knowledge distillation approach. Finally, we show extensive experimental results and analysis on CIFAR-100, miniImageNet and CUB-200 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed one.      
### 14.Target Identification and Bayesian Model Averaging with Probabilistic Hierarchical Factor Probabilities  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11212.pdf)
>  Target detection in hyperspectral imagery is the process of locating pixels from an image which are likely to contain target, typically done by comparing one or more spectra for the desired target material to each pixel in the image. Target identification is the process of target detection incorporating an additional process to identify more specifically the material that is present in each pixel that scored high in detection. Detection is generally a 2-class problem of target vs. background, and identification is a many class problem including target, background, and additional know materials. The identification process we present is probabilistic and hierarchical which provides transparency to the process and produces trustworthy output. In this paper we show that target identification has a much lower false alarm rate than detection alone, and provide a detailed explanation of a robust identification method using probabilistic hierarchical classification that handles the vague categories of materials that depend on users which are different than the specific physical categories of chemical constituents. Identification is often done by comparing mixtures of materials including the target spectra to mixtures of materials that do not include the target spectra, possibly with other steps. (band combinations, feature checking, background removal, etc.) Standard linear regression does not handle these problems well because the number of regressors (identification spectra) is greater than the number of feature variables (bands), and there are multiple correlated spectra. Our proposed method handles these challenges efficiently and provides additional important practical information in the form of hierarchical probabilities computed from Bayesian model averaging.      
### 15.Improving Predictive Performance and Calibration by Weight Fusion in Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11211.pdf)
>  Averaging predictions of a deep ensemble of networks is apopular and effective method to improve predictive performance andcalibration in various benchmarks and Kaggle competitions. However, theruntime and training cost of deep ensembles grow linearly with the size ofthe ensemble, making them unsuitable for many applications. Averagingensemble weights instead of predictions circumvents this disadvantageduring inference and is typically applied to intermediate checkpoints ofa model to reduce training cost. Albeit effective, only few works haveimproved the understanding and the performance of weight averaging.Here, we revisit this approach and show that a simple weight fusion (WF)strategy can lead to a significantly improved predictive performance andcalibration. We describe what prerequisites the weights must meet interms of weight space, functional space and loss. Furthermore, we presenta new test method (called oracle test) to measure the functional spacebetween weights. We demonstrate the versatility of our WF strategy acrossstate of the art segmentation CNNs and Transformers as well as real worlddatasets such as BDD100K and Cityscapes. We compare WF with similarapproaches and show our superiority for in- and out-of-distribution datain terms of predictive performance and calibration.      
### 16.Divide and Conquer: 3D Point Cloud Instance Segmentation With Point-Wise Binarization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11209.pdf)
>  Instance segmentation on point clouds is crucially important for 3D scene understanding. Distance clustering is commonly used in state-of-the-art methods (SOTAs), which is typically effective but does not perform well in segmenting adjacent objects with the same semantic label (especially when they share neighboring points). Due to the uneven distribution of offset points, these existing methods can hardly cluster all instance points. To this end, we design a novel divide and conquer strategy and propose an end-to-end network named PBNet that binarizes each point and clusters them separately to segment instances. PBNet divides offset instance points into two categories: high and low density points (HPs vs.LPs), which are then conquered separately. Adjacent objects can be clearly separated by removing LPs, and then be completed and refined by assigning LPs via a neighbor voting method. To further reduce clustering errors, we develop an iterative merging algorithm based on mean size to aggregate fragment instances. Experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets indicate the superiority of our model. In particular, PBNet achieves so far the best AP50 and AP25 on the ScanNetV2 official benchmark challenge (Validation Set) while demonstrating high efficiency.      
### 17.Target-Driven Structured Transformer Planner for Vision-Language Navigation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11201.pdf)
>  Vision-language navigation is the task of directing an embodied agent to navigate in 3D scenes with natural language instructions. For the agent, inferring the long-term navigation target from visual-linguistic clues is crucial for reliable path planning, which, however, has rarely been studied before in literature. In this article, we propose a Target-Driven Structured Transformer Planner (TD-STP) for long-horizon goal-guided and room layout-aware navigation. Specifically, we devise an Imaginary Scene Tokenization mechanism for explicit estimation of the long-term target (even located in unexplored environments). In addition, we design a Structured Transformer Planner which elegantly incorporates the explored room layout into a neural attention architecture for structured and global planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our TD-STP substantially improves previous best methods' success rate by 2% and 5% on the test set of R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, respectively.

### 18.Progressive Deblurring of Diffusion Models for Coarse-to-Fine Image Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11192.pdf)
>  Recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable results in image synthesis by gradually removing noise and amplifying signals. Although the simple generative process surprisingly works well, is this the best way to generate image data? For instance, despite the fact that human perception is more sensitive to the low frequencies of an image, diffusion models themselves do not consider any relative importance of each frequency component. Therefore, to incorporate the inductive bias for image data, we propose a novel generative process that synthesizes images in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, we generalize the standard diffusion models by enabling diffusion in a rotated coordinate system with different velocities for each component of the vector. We further propose a blur diffusion as a special case, where each frequency component of an image is diffused at different speeds. Specifically, the proposed blur diffusion consists of a forward process that blurs an image and adds noise gradually, after which a corresponding reverse process deblurs an image and removes noise progressively. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the previous method in FID on LSUN bedroom and church datasets.

### 19.Self-Supervised-RCNN for Medical Image Segmentation with Limited Data Annotation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11191.pdf)
>  Many successful methods developed for medical image analysis that are based on machine learning use supervised learning approaches, which often require large datasets annotated by experts to achieve high accuracy. However, medical data annotation is time-consuming and expensive, especially for segmentation tasks. To solve the problem of learning with limited labeled medical image data, an alternative deep learning training strategy based on self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled MRI scans is proposed in this work. Our pretraining approach first, randomly applies different distortions to random areas of unlabeled images and then predicts the type of distortions and loss of information. To this aim, an improved version of Mask-RCNN architecture has been adapted to localize the distortion location and recover the original image pixels. The effectiveness of the proposed method for segmentation tasks in different pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios is evaluated based on the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset. Using this self-supervised pretraining method improved the Dice score by 20% compared to training from scratch. The proposed self-supervised learning is simple, effective, and suitable for different ranges of medical image analysis tasks including anomaly detection, segmentation, and classification.      
### 20.Learning to identify cracks on wind turbine blade surfaces using drone-based inspection images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11186.pdf)
>  Wind energy is expected to be one of the leading ways to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement but it in turn heavily depends on effective management of its operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. Blade failures account for one-third of all O&amp;M costs thus making accurate detection of blade damages, especially cracks, very important for sustained operations and cost savings. Traditionally, damage inspection has been a completely manual process thus making it subjective, error-prone, and time-consuming. Hence in this work, we bring more objectivity, scalability, and repeatability in our damage inspection process, using deep learning, to miss fewer cracks. We build a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of blade damages, collected by our drone-based inspection, to correctly detect cracks. Our model is already in production and has processed more than a million damages with a recall of 0.96. We also focus on model interpretability using class activation maps to get a peek into the model workings. The model not only performs as good as human experts but also better in certain tricky cases. Thus, in this work, we aim to increase wind energy adoption by decreasing one of its major hurdles - the O\&amp;M costs resulting from missing blade failures like cracks.      
### 21.Multi-Faceted Distillation of Base-Novel Commonality for Few-shot Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11184.pdf)
>  Most of existing methods for few-shot object detection follow the fine-tuning paradigm, which potentially assumes that the class-agnostic generalizable knowledge can be learned and transferred implicitly from base classes with abundant samples to novel classes with limited samples via such a two-stage training strategy. However, it is not necessarily true since the object detector can hardly distinguish between class-agnostic knowledge and class-specific knowledge automatically without explicit modeling. In this work we propose to learn three types of class-agnostic commonalities between base and novel classes explicitly: recognition-related semantic commonalities, localization-related semantic commonalities and distribution commonalities. We design a unified distillation framework based on a memory bank, which is able to perform distillation of all three types of commonalities jointly and efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can be readily integrated into most of existing fine-tuning based methods and consistently improve the performance by a large margin.      
### 22.Training Certifiably Robust Neural Networks Against Semantic Perturbations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11177.pdf)
>  Semantic image perturbations, such as scaling and rotation, have been shown to easily deceive deep neural networks (DNNs). Hence, training DNNs to be certifiably robust to these perturbations is critical. However, no prior work has been able to incorporate the objective of deterministic semantic robustness into the training procedure, as existing deterministic semantic verifiers are exceedingly slow. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Semantic Training (CST), the first training framework for deterministic certified robustness against semantic image perturbations. Our framework leverages a novel GPU-optimized verifier that, unlike existing works, is fast enough for use in training. Our results show that networks trained via CST consistently achieve both better provable semantic robustness and clean accuracy, compared to networks trained via baselines based on existing works.      
### 23.Rethinking Few-Shot Object Detection on a Multi-Domain Benchmark  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11169.pdf)
>  Most existing works on few-shot object detection (FSOD) focus on a setting where both pre-training and few-shot learning datasets are from a similar domain. However, few-shot algorithms are important in multiple domains; hence evaluation needs to reflect the broad applications. We propose a Multi-dOmain Few-Shot Object Detection (MoFSOD) benchmark consisting of 10 datasets from a wide range of domains to evaluate FSOD algorithms. We comprehensively analyze the impacts of freezing layers, different architectures, and different pre-training datasets on FSOD performance. Our empirical results show several key factors that have not been explored in previous works: 1) contrary to previous belief, on a multi-domain benchmark, fine-tuning (FT) is a strong baseline for FSOD, performing on par or better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms; 2) utilizing FT as the baseline allows us to explore multiple architectures, and we found them to have a significant impact on down-stream few-shot tasks, even with similar pre-training performances; 3) by decoupling pre-training and few-shot learning, MoFSOD allows us to explore the impact of different pre-training datasets, and the right choice can boost the performance of the down-stream tasks significantly. Based on these findings, we list possible avenues of investigation for improving FSOD performance and propose two simple modifications to existing algorithms that lead to SOTA performance on the MoFSOD benchmark.

### 24.METER-ML: A Multi-sensor Earth Observation Benchmark for Automated Methane Source Mapping  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11166.pdf)
>  Reducing methane emissions is essential for mitigating global warming. To attribute methane emissions to their sources, a comprehensive dataset of methane source infrastructure is necessary. Recent advancements with deep learning on remotely sensed imagery have the potential to identify the locations and characteristics of methane sources, but there is a substantial lack of publicly available data to enable machine learning researchers and practitioners to build automated mapping approaches. To help fill this gap, we construct a multi-sensor dataset called METER-ML containing 86,625 georeferenced NAIP, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 images in the U.S. labeled for the presence or absence of methane source facilities including concentrated animal feeding operations, coal mines, landfills, natural gas processing plants, oil refineries and petroleum terminals, and wastewater treatment plants. We experiment with a variety of models that leverage different spatial resolutions, spatial footprints, image products, and spectral bands. We find that our best model achieves an area under the precision recall curve of 0.915 for identifying concentrated animal feeding operations and 0.821 for oil refineries and petroleum terminals on an expert-labeled test set, suggesting the potential for large-scale mapping. We make METER-ML freely available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/meter-ml/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> to support future work on automated methane source mapping.      
### 25.Adaptive Soft Contrastive Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11163.pdf)
>  Self-supervised learning has recently achieved great success in representation learning without human annotations. The dominant method -- that is contrastive learning, is generally based on instance discrimination tasks, i.e., individual samples are treated as independent categories. However, presuming all the samples are different contradicts the natural grouping of similar samples in common visual datasets, e.g., multiple views of the same dog. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes an adaptive method that introduces soft inter-sample relations, namely Adaptive Soft Contrastive Learning (ASCL). More specifically, ASCL transforms the original instance discrimination task into a multi-instance soft discrimination task, and adaptively introduces inter-sample relations. As an effective and concise plug-in module for existing self-supervised learning frameworks, ASCL achieves the best performance on several benchmarks in terms of both performance and efficiency.

### 26.InfiniteNature-Zero: Learning Perpetual View Generation of Natural Scenes from Single Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11148.pdf)
>  We present a method for learning to generate unbounded flythrough videos of natural scenes starting from a single view, where this capability is learned from a collection of single photographs, without requiring camera poses or even multiple views of each scene. To achieve this, we propose a novel self-supervised view generation training paradigm, where we sample and rendering virtual camera trajectories, including cyclic ones, allowing our model to learn stable view generation from a collection of single views. At test time, despite never seeing a video during training, our approach can take a single image and generate long camera trajectories comprised of hundreds of new views with realistic and diverse content. We compare our approach with recent state-of-the-art supervised view generation methods that require posed multi-view videos and demonstrate superior performance and synthesis quality.      
### 27.VTrackIt: A Synthetic Self-Driving Dataset with Infrastructure and Pooled Vehicle Information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11146.pdf)
>  Artificial intelligence solutions for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have been developed using publicly available datasets such as Argoverse, ApolloScape, Level5, and NuScenes. One major limitation of these datasets is the absence of infrastructure and/or pooled vehicle information like lane line type, vehicle speed, traffic signs, and intersections. Such information is necessary and not complementary to eliminating high-risk edge cases. The rapid advancements in Vehicle-to-Infrastructure and Vehicle-to-Vehicle technologies show promise that infrastructure and pooled vehicle information will soon be accessible in near real-time. Taking a leap in the future, we introduce the first comprehensive synthetic dataset with intelligent infrastructure and pooled vehicle information for advancing the next generation of AVs, named VTrackIt. We also introduce the first deep learning model (InfraGAN) for trajectory predictions that considers such information. Our experiments with InfraGAN show that the comprehensive information offered by VTrackIt reduces the number of high-risk edge cases.

### 28.Adaptive Graph-Based Feature Normalization for Facial Expression Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11123.pdf)
>  Facial Expression Recognition (FER) suffers from data uncertainties caused by ambiguous facial images and annotators' subjectiveness, resulting in excursive semantic and feature covariate shifting problem. Existing works usually correct mislabeled data by estimating noise distribution, or guide network training with knowledge learned from clean data, neglecting the associative relations of expressions. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Graph-based Feature Normalization (AGFN) method to protect FER models from data uncertainties by normalizing feature distributions with the association of expressions. Specifically, we propose a Poisson graph generator to adaptively construct topological graphs for samples in each mini-batches via a sampling process, and correspondingly design a coordinate descent strategy to optimize proposed network. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art works with accuracies of 91.84% and 91.11% on the benchmark datasets FERPlus and RAF-DB, respectively, and when the percentage of mislabeled data increases (e.g., to 20%), our network surpasses existing works significantly by 3.38% and 4.52%.      
### 29.Rethinking the Reference-based Distinctive Image Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11118.pdf)
>  Distinctive Image Captioning (DIC) -- generating distinctive captions that describe the unique details of a target image -- has received considerable attention over the last few years. A recent DIC work proposes to generate distinctive captions by comparing the target image with a set of semantic-similar reference images, i.e., reference-based DIC (Ref-DIC). It aims to make the generated captions can tell apart the target and reference images. Unfortunately, reference images used by existing Ref-DIC works are easy to distinguish: these reference images only resemble the target image at scene-level and have few common objects, such that a Ref-DIC model can trivially generate distinctive captions even without considering the reference images. To ensure Ref-DIC models really perceive the unique objects (or attributes) in target images, we first propose two new Ref-DIC benchmarks. Specifically, we design a two-stage matching mechanism, which strictly controls the similarity between the target and reference images at object-/attribute- level (vs. scene-level). Secondly, to generate distinctive captions, we develop a strong Transformer-based Ref-DIC baseline, dubbed as TransDIC. It not only extracts visual features from the target image, but also encodes the differences between objects in the target and reference images. Finally, for more trustworthy benchmarking, we propose a new evaluation metric named DisCIDEr for Ref-DIC, which evaluates both the accuracy and distinctiveness of the generated captions. Experimental results demonstrate that our TransDIC can generate distinctive captions. Besides, it outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the two new benchmarks over different metrics.      
### 30.DeVIS: Making Deformable Transformers Work for Video Instance Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11103.pdf)
>  Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) jointly tackles multi-object detection, tracking, and segmentation in video sequences. In the past, VIS methods mirrored the fragmentation of these subtasks in their architectural design, hence missing out on a joint solution. Transformers recently allowed to cast the entire VIS task as a single set-prediction problem. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of existing Transformer-based methods requires long training times, high memory requirements, and processing of low-single-scale feature maps. Deformable attention provides a more efficient alternative but its application to the temporal domain or the segmentation task have not yet been explored. <br>In this work, we present Deformable VIS (DeVIS), a VIS method which capitalizes on the efficiency and performance of deformable Transformers. To reason about all VIS subtasks jointly over multiple frames, we present temporal multi-scale deformable attention with instance-aware object queries. We further introduce a new image and video instance mask head with multi-scale features, and perform near-online video processing with multi-cue clip tracking. DeVIS reduces memory as well as training time requirements, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the YouTube-VIS 2021, as well as the challenging OVIS dataset. <br>Code is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/acaelles97/DeVIS" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 31.Zero-Shot Video Captioning with Evolving Pseudo-Tokens  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11100.pdf)
>  We introduce a zero-shot video captioning method that employs two frozen networks: the GPT-2 language model and the CLIP image-text matching model. The matching score is used to steer the language model toward generating a sentence that has a high average matching score to a subset of the video frames. Unlike zero-shot image captioning methods, our work considers the entire sentence at once. This is achieved by optimizing, during the generation process, part of the prompt from scratch, by modifying the representation of all other tokens in the prompt, and by repeating the process iteratively, gradually improving the specificity and comprehensiveness of the generated sentence. Our experiments show that the generated captions are coherent and display a broad range of real-world knowledge.

### 32.Visual Speech-Aware Perceptual 3D Facial Expression Reconstruction from Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11094.pdf)
>  The recent state of the art on monocular 3D face reconstruction from image data has made some impressive advancements, thanks to the advent of Deep Learning. However, it has mostly focused on input coming from a single RGB image, overlooking the following important factors: a) Nowadays, the vast majority of facial image data of interest do not originate from single images but rather from videos, which contain rich dynamic information. b) Furthermore, these videos typically capture individuals in some form of verbal communication (public talks, teleconferences, audiovisual human-computer interactions, interviews, monologues/dialogues in movies, etc). When existing 3D face reconstruction methods are applied in such videos, the artifacts in the reconstruction of the shape and motion of the mouth area are often severe, since they do not match well with the speech audio. <br>To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we present the first method for visual speech-aware perceptual reconstruction of 3D mouth expressions. We do this by proposing a "lipread" loss, which guides the fitting process so that the elicited perception from the 3D reconstructed talking head resembles that of the original video footage. We demonstrate that, interestingly, the lipread loss is better suited for 3D reconstruction of mouth movements compared to traditional landmark losses, and even direct 3D supervision. Furthermore, the devised method does not rely on any text transcriptions or corresponding audio, rendering it ideal for training in unlabeled datasets. We verify the efficiency of our method through exhaustive objective evaluations on three large-scale datasets, as well as subjective evaluation with two web-based user studies.      
### 33.Facial Expression Recognition using Vanilla ViT backbones with MAE Pretraining  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11081.pdf)
>  Humans usually convey emotions voluntarily or involuntarily by facial expressions. Automatically recognizing the basic expression (such as happiness, sadness, and neutral) from a facial image, i.e., facial expression recognition (FER), is extremely challenging and attracts much research interests. Large scale datasets and powerful inference models have been proposed to address the problem. Though considerable progress has been made, most of the state of the arts employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or elaborately modified Vision Transformers (ViTs) depend heavily on upstream supervised pretraining. Transformers are taking place the domination of CNNs in more and more computer vision tasks. But they usually need much more data to train, since they use less inductive biases compared with CNNs. To explore whether a vanilla ViT without extra training samples from upstream tasks is able to achieve competitive accuracy, we use a plain ViT with MAE pretraining to perform the FER task. Specifically, we first pretrain the original ViT as a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) on a large facial expression dataset without expression labels. Then, we fine-tune the ViT on popular facial expression datasets with expression labels. The presented method is quite competitive with 90.22\% on RAF-DB, 61.73\% on AfectNet and can serve as a simple yet strong ViT-based baseline for FER studies.      
### 34.RealFlow: EM-based Realistic Optical Flow Dataset Generation from Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11075.pdf)
>  Obtaining the ground truth labels from a video is challenging since the manual annotation of pixel-wise flow labels is prohibitively expensive and laborious. Besides, existing approaches try to adapt the trained model on synthetic datasets to authentic videos, which inevitably suffers from domain discrepancy and hinders the performance for real-world applications. To solve these problems, we propose RealFlow, an Expectation-Maximization based framework that can create large-scale optical flow datasets directly from any unlabeled realistic videos. Specifically, we first estimate optical flow between a pair of video frames, and then synthesize a new image from this pair based on the predicted flow. Thus the new image pairs and their corresponding flows can be regarded as a new training set. Besides, we design a Realistic Image Pair Rendering (RIPR) module that adopts softmax splatting and bi-directional hole filling techniques to alleviate the artifacts of the image synthesis. In the E-step, RIPR renders new images to create a large quantity of training data. In the M-step, we utilize the generated training data to train an optical flow network, which can be used to estimate optical flows in the next E-step. During the iterative learning steps, the capability of the flow network is gradually improved, so is the accuracy of the flow, as well as the quality of the synthesized dataset. Experimental results show that RealFlow outperforms previous dataset generation methods by a considerably large margin. Moreover, based on the generated dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks compared with both supervised and unsupervised optical flow methods.

### 35.3D Interacting Hand Pose Estimation by Hand De-occlusion and Removal  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11061.pdf)
>  Estimating 3D interacting hand pose from a single RGB image is essential for understanding human actions. Unlike most previous works that directly predict the 3D poses of two interacting hands simultaneously, we propose to decompose the challenging interacting hand pose estimation task and estimate the pose of each hand separately. In this way, it is straightforward to take advantage of the latest research progress on the single-hand pose estimation system. However, hand pose estimation in interacting scenarios is very challenging, due to (1) severe hand-hand occlusion and (2) ambiguity caused by the homogeneous appearance of hands. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a novel Hand De-occlusion and Removal (HDR) framework to perform hand de-occlusion and distractor removal. We also propose the first large-scale synthetic amodal hand dataset, termed Amodal InterHand Dataset (AIH), to facilitate model training and promote the development of the related research. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art interacting hand pose estimation approaches.

### 36.MobileDenseNet: A new approach to object detection on mobile devices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11031.pdf)
>  Object detection problem solving has developed greatly within the past few years. There is a need for lighter models in instances where hardware limitations exist, as well as a demand for models to be tailored to mobile devices. In this article, we will assess the methods used when creating algorithms that address these issues. The main goal of this article is to increase accuracy in state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining speed and real-time efficiency. The most significant issues in one-stage object detection pertains to small objects and inaccurate localization. As a solution, we created a new network by the name of MobileDenseNet suitable for embedded systems. We also developed a light neck FCPNLite for mobile devices that will aid with the detection of small objects. Our research revealed that very few papers cited necks in embedded systems. What differentiates our network from others is our use of concatenation features. A small yet significant change to the head of the network amplified accuracy without increasing speed or limiting parameters. In short, our focus on the challenging CoCo and Pascal VOC datasets were 24.8 and 76.8 in percentage terms respectively - a rate higher than that recorded by other state-of-the-art systems thus far. Our network is able to increase accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency on mobile devices. We calculated operational speed on Pixel 3 (Snapdragon 845) to 22.8 fps.

### 37.Custom Structure Preservation in Face Aging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11025.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose a novel architecture for face age editing that can produce structural modifications while maintaining relevant details present in the original image. We disentangle the style and content of the input image and propose a new decoder network that adopts a style-based strategy to combine the style and content representations of the input image while conditioning the output on the target age. We go beyond existing aging methods allowing users to adjust the degree of structure preservation in the input image during inference. To this purpose, we introduce a masking mechanism, the CUstom Structure Preservation module, that distinguishes relevant regions in the input image from those that should be discarded. CUSP requires no additional supervision. Finally, our quantitative and qualitative analysis which include a user study, show that our method outperforms prior art and demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy regarding image editing and adjustable structure preservation.

### 38.Open video data sharing in developmental and behavioural science  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11020.pdf)
>  Video recording is a widely used method for documenting infant and child behaviours in research and clinical practice. Video data has rarely been shared due to ethical concerns of confidentiality, although the need of shared large-scaled datasets remains increasing. This demand is even more imperative when data-driven computer-based approaches are involved, such as screening tools to complement clinical assessments. To share data while abiding by privacy protection rules, a critical question arises whether efforts at data de-identification reduce data utility? We addressed this question by showcasing the Prechtl's general movements assessment (GMA), an established and globally practised video-based diagnostic tool in early infancy for detecting neurological deficits, such as cerebral palsy. To date, no shared expert-annotated large data repositories for infant movement analyses exist. Such datasets would massively benefit training and recalibration of human assessors and the development of computer-based approaches. In the current study, sequences from a prospective longitudinal infant cohort with a total of 19451 available general movements video snippets were randomly selected for human clinical reasoning and computer-based analysis. We demonstrated for the first time that pseudonymisation by face-blurring video recordings is a viable approach. The video redaction did not affect classification accuracy for either human assessors or computer vision methods, suggesting an adequate and easy-to-apply solution for sharing movement video data. We call for further explorations into efficient and privacy rule-conforming approaches for deidentifying video data in scientific and clinical fields beyond movement assessments. These approaches shall enable sharing and merging stand-alone video datasets into large data pools to advance science and public health.      
### 39.Fact sheet: Automatic Self-Reported Personality Recognition Track  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11012.pdf)
>  We propose an informed baseline to help disentangle the various contextual factors of influence in this type of case studies. For this purpose, we analysed the correlation between the given metadata and the self-assigned personality trait scores and developed a model based solely on this information. Further, we compared the performance of this informed baseline with models based on state-of-the-art visual, linguistic and audio features. For the present dataset, a model trained solely on simple metadata features (age, gender and number of sessions) proved to have superior or similar performance when compared with simple audio, linguistic or visual features-based systems.      
### 40.POP: Mining POtential Performance of new fashion products via webly cross-modal query expansion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11001.pdf)
>  We propose a data-centric pipeline able to generate exogenous observation data for the New Fashion Product Performance Forecasting (NFPPF) problem, i.e., predicting the performance of a brand-new clothing probe with no available past observations. Our pipeline manufactures the missing past starting from a single, available image of the clothing probe. It starts by expanding textual tags associated with the image, querying related fashionable or unfashionable images uploaded on the web at a specific time in the past. A binary classifier is robustly trained on these web images by confident learning, to learn what was fashionable in the past and how much the probe image conforms to this notion of fashionability. This compliance produces the POtential Performance (POP) time series, indicating how performing the probe could have been if it were available earlier. POP proves to be highly predictive for the probe's future performance, ameliorating the sales forecasts of all state-of-the-art models on the recent VISUELLE fast-fashion dataset. We also show that POP reflects the ground-truth popularity of new styles (ensembles of clothing items) on the Fashion Forward benchmark, demonstrating that our webly-learned signal is a truthful expression of popularity, accessible by everyone and generalizable to any time of analysis. Forecasting code, data and the POP time series are available at: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/HumaticsLAB/POP-Mining-POtential-Performance" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 41.Meta-Registration: Learning Test-Time Optimization for Single-Pair Image Registration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10996.pdf)
>  Neural networks have been proposed for medical image registration by learning, with a substantial amount of training data, the optimal transformations between image pairs. These trained networks can further be optimized on a single pair of test images - known as test-time optimization. This work formulates image registration as a meta-learning algorithm. Such networks can be trained by aligning the training image pairs while simultaneously improving test-time optimization efficacy; tasks which were previously considered two independent training and optimization processes. The proposed meta-registration is hypothesized to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the test-time optimization in the "outer" meta-optimization of the networks. For image guidance applications that often are time-critical yet limited in training data, the potentially gained speed and accuracy are compared with classical registration algorithms, registration networks without meta-learning, and single-pair optimization without test-time optimization data. Experiments are presented in this paper using clinical transrectal ultrasound image data from 108 prostate cancer patients. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of a meta-registration protocol, which yields significantly improved performance relative to existing learning-based methods. Furthermore, the meta-registration achieves comparable results to classical iterative methods in a fraction of the time, owing to its rapid test-time optimization process.      
### 42.Learning Generalized Non-Rigid Multimodal Biomedical Image Registration from Generic Point Set Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10994.pdf)
>  Free Point Transformer (FPT) has been proposed as a data-driven, non-rigid point set registration approach using deep neural networks. As FPT does not assume constraints based on point vicinity or correspondence, it may be trained simply and in a flexible manner by minimizing an unsupervised loss based on the Chamfer Distance. This makes FPT amenable to real-world medical imaging applications where ground-truth deformations may be infeasible to obtain, or in scenarios where only a varying degree of completeness in the point sets to be aligned is available. To test the limit of the correspondence finding ability of FPT and its dependency on training data sets, this work explores the generalizability of the FPT from well-curated non-medical data sets to medical imaging data sets. First, we train FPT on the ModelNet40 dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness and the superior registration performance of FPT over iterative and learning-based point set registration methods. Second, we demonstrate superior performance in rigid and non-rigid registration and robustness to missing data. Last, we highlight the interesting generalizability of the ModelNet-trained FPT by registering reconstructed freehand ultrasound scans of the spine and generic spine models without additional training, whereby the average difference to the ground truth curvatures is 1.3 degrees, across 13 patients.      
### 43.Taguchi based Design of Sequential Convolution Neural Network for Classification of Defective Fasteners  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10992.pdf)
>  Fasteners play a critical role in securing various parts of machinery. Deformations such as dents, cracks, and scratches on the surface of fasteners are caused by material properties and incorrect handling of equipment during production processes. As a result, quality control is required to ensure safe and reliable operations. The existing defect inspection method relies on manual examination, which consumes a significant amount of time, money, and other resources; also, accuracy cannot be guaranteed due to human error. Automatic defect detection systems have proven impactful over the manual inspection technique for defect analysis. However, computational techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning-based approaches are evolutionary methods. By carefully selecting the design parameter values, the full potential of CNN can be realised. Using Taguchi-based design of experiments and analysis, an attempt has been made to develop a robust automatic system in this study. The dataset used to train the system has been created manually for M14 size nuts having two labeled classes: Defective and Non-defective. There are a total of 264 images in the dataset. The proposed sequential CNN comes up with a 96.3% validation accuracy, 0.277 validation loss at 0.001 learning rate.      
### 44.Few-shot Object Counting and Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10988.pdf)
>  We tackle a new task of few-shot object counting and detection. Given a few exemplar bounding boxes of a target object class, we seek to count and detect all objects of the target class. This task shares the same supervision as the few-shot object counting but additionally outputs the object bounding boxes along with the total object count. To address this challenging problem, we introduce a novel two-stage training strategy and a novel uncertainty-aware few-shot object detector: Counting-DETR. The former is aimed at generating pseudo ground-truth bounding boxes to train the latter. The latter leverages the pseudo ground-truth provided by the former but takes the necessary steps to account for the imperfection of pseudo ground-truth. To validate the performance of our method on the new task, we introduce two new datasets named FSCD-147 and FSCD-LVIS. Both datasets contain images with complex scenes, multiple object classes per image, and a huge variation in object shapes, sizes, and appearance. Our proposed approach outperforms very strong baselines adapted from few-shot object counting and few-shot object detection with a large margin in both counting and detection metrics. The code and models are available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/VinAIResearch/Counting-DETR" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 45.NeurAR: Neural Uncertainty for Autonomous 3D Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10985.pdf)
>  Implicit neural representations have shown compelling results in offline 3D reconstruction and also recently demonstrated the potential for online SLAM systems. However, applying them to autonomous 3D reconstruction, where robots are required to explore a scene and plan a view path for the reconstruction, has not been studied. In this paper, we explore for the first time the possibility of using implicit neural representations for autonomous 3D scene reconstruction by addressing two key challenges: 1) seeking a criterion to measure the quality of the candidate viewpoints for the view planning based on the new representations, and 2) learning the criterion from data that can generalize to different scenes instead of hand-crafting one. For the first challenge, a proxy of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is proposed to quantify a viewpoint quality. The proxy is acquired by treating the color of a spatial point in a scene as a random variable under a Gaussian distribution rather than a deterministic one; the variance of the distribution quantifies the uncertainty of the reconstruction and composes the proxy. For the second challenge, the proxy is optimized jointly with the parameters of an implicit neural network for the scene. With the proposed view quality criterion, we can then apply the new representations to autonomous 3D reconstruction. Our method demonstrates significant improvements on various metrics for the rendered image quality and the geometry quality of the reconstructed 3D models when compared with variants using TSDF or reconstruction without view planning.      
### 46.Learning Human Kinematics by Modeling Temporal Correlations between Joints for Video-based Human Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10971.pdf)
>  Estimating human poses from videos is critical in human-computer interaction. By precisely estimating human poses, the robot can provide an appropriate response to the human. Most existing approaches use the optical flow, RNNs, or CNNs to extract temporal features from videos. Despite the positive results of these attempts, most of them only straightforwardly integrate features along the temporal dimension, ignoring temporal correlations between joints. In contrast to previous methods, we propose a plug-and-play kinematics modeling module (KMM) based on the domain-cross attention mechanism to model the temporal correlation between joints across different frames explicitly. Specifically, the proposed KMM models the temporal correlation between any two joints by calculating their temporal similarity. In this way, KMM can learn the motion cues of each joint. Using the motion cues (temporal domain) and historical positions of joints (spatial domain), KMM can infer the initial positions of joints in the current frame in advance. In addition, we present a kinematics modeling network (KIMNet) based on the KMM for obtaining the final positions of joints by combining pose features and initial positions of joints. By explicitly modeling temporal correlations between joints, KIMNet can infer the occluded joints at present according to all joints at the previous moment. Furthermore, the KMM is achieved through an attention mechanism, which allows it to maintain the high resolution of features. Therefore, it can transfer rich historical pose information to the current frame, which provides effective pose information for locating occluded joints. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two standard video-based pose estimation benchmarks. Moreover, the proposed KIMNet shows some robustness to the occlusion, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.      
### 47.Opportunistic hip fracture risk prediction in Men from X-ray: Findings from the Osteoporosis in Men (MrOS) Study  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10970.pdf)
>  Osteoporosis is a common disease that increases fracture risk. Hip fractures, especially in elderly people, lead to increased morbidity, decreased quality of life and increased mortality. Being a silent disease before fracture, osteoporosis often remains undiagnosed and untreated. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold-standard method for osteoporosis diagnosis and hence also for future fracture prediction (prognostic). However, the required special equipment is not broadly available everywhere, in particular not to patients in developing countries. We propose a deep learning classification model (FORM) that can directly predict hip fracture risk from either plain radiographs (X-ray) or 2D projection images of computed tomography (CT) data. Our method is fully automated and therefore well suited for opportunistic screening settings, identifying high risk patients in a broader population without additional screening. FORM was trained and evaluated on X-rays and CT projections from the Osteoporosis in Men (MrOS) study. 3108 X-rays (89 incident hip fractures) or 2150 CTs (80 incident hip fractures) with a 80/20 split were used. We show that FORM can correctly predict the 10-year hip fracture risk with a validation AUC of 81.44 +- 3.11% / 81.04 +- 5.54% (mean +- STD) including additional information like age, BMI, fall history and health background across a 5-fold cross validation on the X-ray and CT cohort, respectively. Our approach significantly (p &lt; 0.01) outperforms previous methods like Cox Proportional-Hazards Model and \frax with 70.19 +- 6.58 and 74.72 +- 7.21 respectively on the X-ray cohort. Our model outperform on both cohorts hip aBMD based predictions. We are confident that FORM can contribute on improving osteoporosis diagnosis at an early stage.      
### 48.QueryProp: Object Query Propagation for High-Performance Video Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10959.pdf)
>  Video object detection has been an important yet challenging topic in computer vision. Traditional methods mainly focus on designing the image-level or box-level feature propagation strategies to exploit temporal information. This paper argues that with a more effective and efficient feature propagation framework, video object detectors can gain improvement in terms of both accuracy and speed. For this purpose, this paper studies object-level feature propagation, and proposes an object query propagation (QueryProp) framework for high-performance video object detection. The proposed QueryProp contains two propagation strategies: 1) query propagation is performed from sparse key frames to dense non-key frames to reduce the redundant computation on non-key frames; 2) query propagation is performed from previous key frames to the current key frame to improve feature representation by temporal context modeling. To further facilitate query propagation, an adaptive propagation gate is designed to achieve flexible key frame selection. We conduct extensive experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset. QueryProp achieves comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods and strikes a decent accuracy/speed trade-off.

### 49.Faster VoxelPose: Real-time 3D Human Pose Estimation by Orthographic Projection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10955.pdf)
>  While the voxel-based methods have achieved promising results for multi-person 3D pose estimation from multi-cameras, they suffer from heavy computation burdens, especially for large scenes. We present Faster VoxelPose to address the challenge by re-projecting the feature volume to the three two-dimensional coordinate planes and estimating X, Y, Z coordinates from them separately. To that end, we first localize each person by a 3D bounding box by estimating a 2D box and its height based on the volume features projected to the xy-plane and z-axis, respectively. Then for each person, we estimate partial joint coordinates from the three coordinate planes separately which are then fused to obtain the final 3D pose. The method is free from costly 3D-CNNs and improves the speed of VoxelPose by ten times and meanwhile achieves competitive accuracy as the state-of-the-art methods, proving its potential in real-time applications.      
### 50.Visible and Near Infrared Image Fusion Based on Texture Information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10953.pdf)
>  Multi-sensor fusion is widely used in the environment perception system of the autonomous vehicle. It solves the interference caused by environmental changes and makes the whole driving system safer and more reliable. In this paper, a novel visible and near-infrared fusion method based on texture information is proposed to enhance unstructured environmental images. It aims at the problems of artifact, information loss and noise in traditional visible and near infrared image fusion methods. Firstly, the structure information of the visible image (RGB) and the near infrared image (NIR) after texture removal is obtained by relative total variation (RTV) calculation as the base layer of the fused image; secondly, a Bayesian classification model is established to calculate the noise weight and the noise information and the noise information in the visible image is adaptively filtered by joint bilateral filter; finally, the fused image is acquired by color space conversion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can preserve the spectral characteristics and the unique information of visible and near-infrared images without artifacts and color distortion, and has good robustness as well as preserving the unique texture.      
### 51.Vision-based Human Fall Detection Systems using Deep Learning: A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10952.pdf)
>  Human fall is one of the very critical health issues, especially for elders and disabled people living alone. The number of elder populations is increasing steadily worldwide. Therefore, human fall detection is becoming an effective technique for assistive living for those people. For assistive living, deep learning and computer vision have been used largely. In this review article, we discuss deep learning (DL)-based state-of-the-art non-intrusive (vision-based) fall detection techniques. We also present a survey on fall detection benchmark datasets. For a clear understanding, we briefly discuss different metrics which are used to evaluate the performance of the fall detection systems. This article also gives a future direction on vision-based human fall detection techniques.      
### 52.Scale dependant layer for self-supervised nuclei encoding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10950.pdf)
>  Recent developments in self-supervised learning give us the possibility to further reduce human intervention in multi-step pipelines where the focus evolves around particular objects of interest. In the present paper, the focus lays in the nuclei in histopathology images. In particular we aim at extracting cellular information in an unsupervised manner for a downstream task. As nuclei present themselves in a variety of sizes, we propose a new Scale-dependant convolutional layer to bypass scaling issues when resizing nuclei. On three nuclei datasets, we benchmark the following methods: handcrafted, pre-trained ResNet, supervised ResNet and self-supervised features. We show that the proposed convolution layer boosts performance and that this layer combined with Barlows-Twins allows for better nuclei encoding compared to the supervised paradigm in the low sample setting and outperforms all other proposed unsupervised methods. In addition, we extend the existing TNBC dataset to incorporate nuclei class annotation in order to enrich and publicly release a small sample setting dataset for nuclei segmentation and classification.      
### 53.Dynamic Local Aggregation Network with Adaptive Clusterer for Anomaly Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10948.pdf)
>  Existing methods for anomaly detection based on memory-augmented autoencoder (AE) have the following drawbacks: (1) Establishing a memory bank requires additional memory space. (2) The fixed number of prototypes from subjective assumptions ignores the data feature differences and diversity. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce DLAN-AC, a Dynamic Local Aggregation Network with Adaptive Clusterer, for anomaly detection. First, The proposed DLAN can automatically learn and aggregate high-level features from the AE to obtain more representative prototypes, while freeing up extra memory space. Second, The proposed AC can adaptively cluster video data to derive initial prototypes with prior information. In addition, we also propose a dynamic redundant clustering strategy (DRCS) to enable DLAN for automatically eliminating feature clusters that do not contribute to the construction of prototypes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that DLAN-AC outperforms most existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our method.

### 54.Long-tailed Instance Segmentation using Gumbel Optimized Loss  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10936.pdf)
>  Major advancements have been made in the field of object detection and segmentation recently. However, when it comes to rare categories, the state-of-the-art methods fail to detect them, resulting in a significant performance gap between rare and frequent categories. In this paper, we identify that Sigmoid or Softmax functions used in deep detectors are a major reason for low performance and are sub-optimal for long-tailed detection and segmentation. To address this, we develop a Gumbel Optimized Loss (GOL), for long-tailed detection and segmentation. It aligns with the Gumbel distribution of rare classes in imbalanced datasets, considering the fact that most classes in long-tailed detection have low expected probability. The proposed GOL significantly outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by 1.1% on AP , and boosts the overall segmentation by 9.0% and detection by 8.0%, particularly improving detection of rare classes by 20.3%, compared to Mask-RCNN, on LVIS dataset.

### 55.PLD-SLAM: A Real-Time Visual SLAM Using Points and Line Segments in Dynamic Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10916.pdf)
>  In this paper, we consider the problems in the practical application of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). With the popularization and application of the technology in wide scope, the practicability of SLAM system has become a new hot topic after the accuracy and robustness, e.g., how to keep the stability of the system and achieve accurate pose estimation in the low-texture and dynamic environment, and how to improve the universality and real-time performance of the system in the real scenes, etc. This paper proposes a real-time stereo indirect visual SLAM system, PLD-SLAM, which combines point and line features, and avoid the impact of dynamic objects in highly dynamic environments. We also present a novel global gray similarity (GGS) algorithm to achieve reasonable keyframe selection and efficient loop closure detection (LCD). Benefiting from the GGS, PLD-SLAM can realize real-time accurate pose estimation in most real scenes without pre-training and loading a huge feature dictionary model. To verify the performance of the proposed system, we compare it with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the public datasets KITTI, EuRoC MAV, and the indoor stereo datasets provided by us, etc. The experiments show that the PLD-SLAM has better real-time performance while ensuring stability and accuracy in most scenarios. In addition, through the analysis of the experimental results of the GGS, we can find it has excellent performance in the keyframe selection and LCD.      
### 56.Optimization of Forcemyography Sensor Placement for Arm Movement Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10915.pdf)
>  How to design an optimal wearable device for human movement recognition is vital to reliable and accurate human-machine collaboration. Previous works mainly fabricate wearable devices heuristically. Instead, this paper raises an academic question: can we design an optimization algorithm to optimize the fabrication of wearable devices such as figuring out the best sensor arrangement automatically? Specifically, this work focuses on optimizing the placement of Forcemyography (FMG) sensors for FMG armbands in the application of arm movement recognition. Firstly, based on graph theory, the armband is modeled considering sensors' signals and connectivity. Then, a Graph-based Armband Modeling Network (GAM-Net) is introduced for arm movement recognition. Afterward, the sensor placement optimization for FMG armbands is formulated and an optimization algorithm with greedy local search is proposed. To study the effectiveness of our optimization algorithm, a dataset for mechanical maintenance tasks using FMG armbands with 16 sensors is collected. Our experiments show that using only 4 sensors optimized with our algorithm can help maintain a comparable recognition accuracy to using all sensors. Finally, the optimized sensor placement result is verified from a physiological view. This work would like to shed light on the automatic fabrication of wearable devices considering downstream tasks, such as human biological signal collection and movement recognition.

### 57.DBQ-SSD: Dynamic Ball Query for Efficient 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10909.pdf)
>  Many point-based 3D detectors adopt point-feature sampling strategies to drop some points for efficient inference. These strategies are typically based on fixed and handcrafted rules, making difficult to handle complicated scenes. Different from them, we propose a Dynamic Ball Query (DBQ) network to adaptively select a subset of input points according to the input features, and assign the feature transform with suitable receptive field for each selected point. It can be embedded into some state-of-the-art 3D detectors and trained in an end-to-end manner, which significantly reduces the computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can reduce latency by 30%-60% on KITTI and Waymo datasets. Specifically, the inference speed of our detector can reach 162 FPS and 30 FPS with negligible performance degradation on KITTI and Waymo datasets, respectively.      
### 58.Decoupled Adversarial Contrastive Learning for Self-supervised Adversarial Robustness  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10899.pdf)
>  Adversarial training (AT) for robust representation learning and self-supervised learning (SSL) for unsupervised representation learning are two active research fields. Integrating AT into SSL, multiple prior works have accomplished a highly significant yet challenging task: learning robust representation without labels. A widely used framework is adversarial contrastive learning which couples AT and SSL, and thus constitute a very complex optimization problem. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer philosophy, we conjecture that it might be simplified as well as improved by solving two sub-problems: non-robust SSL and pseudo-supervised AT. This motivation shifts the focus of the task from seeking an optimal integrating strategy for a coupled problem to finding sub-solutions for sub-problems. With this said, this work discards prior practices of directly introducing AT to SSL frameworks and proposed a two-stage framework termed Decoupled Adversarial Contrastive Learning (DeACL). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DeACL achieves SOTA self-supervised adversarial robustness while significantly reducing the training time, which validates its effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, our DeACL constitutes a more explainable solution, and its success also bridges the gap with semi-supervised AT for exploiting unlabeled samples for robust representation learning.

### 59.Efficient Modeling of Future Context for Image Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10897.pdf)
>  Existing approaches to image captioning usually generate the sentence word-by-word from left to right, with the constraint of conditioned on local context including the given image and history generated words. There have been many studies target to make use of global information during decoding, e.g., iterative refinement. However, it is still under-explored how to effectively and efficiently incorporate the future context. To respond to this issue, inspired by that Non-Autoregressive Image Captioning (NAIC) can leverage two-side relation with modified mask operation, we aim to graft this advance to the conventional Autoregressive Image Captioning (AIC) model while maintaining the inference efficiency without extra time cost. Specifically, AIC and NAIC models are first trained combined with shared visual encoders, forcing the visual encoder to contain sufficient and valid future context; then the AIC model is encouraged to capture the causal dynamics of cross-layer interchanging from NAIC model on its unconfident words, which follows a teacher-student paradigm and optimized with the distribution calibration training objective. Empirical evidences demonstrate that our proposed approach clearly surpass the state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations on the MS COCO benchmark.

### 60.3D Random Occlusion and Multi-Layer Projection for Deep Multi-Camera Pedestrian Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10895.pdf)
>  Although deep-learning based methods for monocular pedestrian detection have made great progress, they are still vulnerable to heavy occlusions. Using multi-view information fusion is a potential solution but has limited applications, due to the lack of annotated training samples in existing multi-view datasets, which increases the risk of overfitting. To address this problem, a data augmentation method is proposed to randomly generate 3D cylinder occlusions, on the ground plane, which are of the average size of pedestrians and projected to multiple views, to relieve the impact of overfitting in the training. Moreover, the feature map of each view is projected to multiple parallel planes at different heights, by using homographies, which allows the CNNs to fully utilize the features across the height of each pedestrian to infer the locations of pedestrians on the ground plane. The proposed 3DROM method has a greatly improved performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art deep-learning based methods for multi-view pedestrian detection.      
### 61.Bi-directional Contrastive Learning for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10892.pdf)
>  We present a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method for semantic segmentation that generalizes a model trained with source images and corresponding ground-truth labels to a target domain. A key to domain adaptive semantic segmentation is to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features without target ground-truth labels. To this end, we propose a bi-directional pixel-prototype contrastive learning framework that minimizes intra-class variations of features for the same object class, while maximizing inter-class variations for different ones, regardless of domains. Specifically, our framework aligns pixel-level features and a prototype of the same object class in target and source images (i.e., positive pairs), respectively, sets them apart for different classes (i.e., negative pairs), and performs the alignment and separation processes toward the other direction with pixel-level features in the source image and a prototype in the target image. The cross-domain matching encourages domain-invariant feature representations, while the bidirectional pixel-prototype correspondences aggregate features for the same object class, providing discriminative features. To establish training pairs for contrastive learning, we propose to generate dynamic pseudo labels of target images using a non-parametric label transfer, that is, pixel-prototype correspondences across different domains. We also present a calibration method compensating class-wise domain biases of prototypes gradually during training.      
### 62.FairGRAPE: Fairness-aware GRAdient Pruning mEthod for Face Attribute Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10888.pdf)
>  Existing pruning techniques preserve deep neural networks' overall ability to make correct predictions but may also amplify hidden biases during the compression process. We propose a novel pruning method, Fairness-aware GRAdient Pruning mEthod (FairGRAPE), that minimizes the disproportionate impacts of pruning on different sub-groups. Our method calculates the per-group importance of each model weight and selects a subset of weights that maintain the relative between-group total importance in pruning. The proposed method then prunes network edges with small importance values and repeats the procedure by updating importance values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on four different datasets, FairFace, UTKFace, CelebA, and ImageNet, for the tasks of face attribute classification where our method reduces the disparity in performance degradation by up to 90% compared to the state-of-the-art pruning algorithms. Our method is substantially more effective in a setting with a high pruning rate (99%).

### 63.My View is the Best View: Procedure Learning from Egocentric Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10883.pdf)
>  Procedure learning involves identifying the key-steps and determining their logical order to perform a task. Existing approaches commonly use third-person videos for learning the procedure, making the manipulated object small in appearance and often occluded by the actor, leading to significant errors. In contrast, we observe that videos obtained from first-person (egocentric) wearable cameras provide an unobstructed and clear view of the action. However, procedure learning from egocentric videos is challenging because (a) the camera view undergoes extreme changes due to the wearer's head motion, and (b) the presence of unrelated frames due to the unconstrained nature of the videos. Due to this, current state-of-the-art methods' assumptions that the actions occur at approximately the same time and are of the same duration, do not hold. Instead, we propose to use the signal provided by the temporal correspondences between key-steps across videos. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised Correspond and Cut (CnC) framework for procedure learning. CnC identifies and utilizes the temporal correspondences between the key-steps across multiple videos to learn the procedure. Our experiments show that CnC outperforms the state-of-the-art on the benchmark ProceL and CrossTask datasets by 5.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Furthermore, for procedure learning using egocentric videos, we propose the EgoProceL dataset consisting of 62 hours of videos captured by 130 subjects performing 16 tasks.

### 64.An Ensemble Approach for Multiple Emotion Descriptors Estimation Using Multi-task Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10878.pdf)
>  This paper illustrates our submission method to the fourth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) Competition. The method is used for the Multi-Task Learning Challenge. Instead of using only face information, we employ full information from a provided dataset containing face and the context around the face. We utilized the InceptionNet V3 model to extract deep features then we applied the attention mechanism to refine the features. After that, we put those features into the transformer block and multi-layer perceptron networks to get the final multiple kinds of emotion. Our model predicts arousal and valence, classifies the emotional expression and estimates the action units simultaneously. The proposed system achieves the performance of 0.917 on the MTL Challenge validation dataset.      
### 65.Cost Aggregation with 4D Convolutional Swin Transformer for Few-Shot Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10866.pdf)
>  This paper presents a novel cost aggregation network, called Volumetric Aggregation with Transformers (VAT), for few-shot segmentation. The use of transformers can benefit correlation map aggregation through self-attention over a global receptive field. However, the tokenization of a correlation map for transformer processing can be detrimental, because the discontinuity at token boundaries reduces the local context available near the token edges and decreases inductive bias. To address this problem, we propose a 4D Convolutional Swin Transformer, where a high-dimensional Swin Transformer is preceded by a series of small-kernel convolutions that impart local context to all pixels and introduce convolutional inductive bias. We additionally boost aggregation performance by applying transformers within a pyramidal structure, where aggregation at a coarser level guides aggregation at a finer level. Noise in the transformer output is then filtered in the subsequent decoder with the help of the query's appearance embedding. With this model, a new state-of-the-art is set for all the standard benchmarks in few-shot segmentation. It is shown that VAT attains state-of-the-art performance for semantic correspondence as well, where cost aggregation also plays a central role.      
### 66.On Higher Adversarial Susceptibility of Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10862.pdf)
>  Contrastive self-supervised learning (CSL) has managed to match or surpass the performance of supervised learning in image and video classification. However, it is still largely unknown if the nature of the representation induced by the two learning paradigms is similar. We investigate this under the lens of adversarial robustness. Our analytical treatment of the problem reveals intrinsic higher sensitivity of CSL over supervised learning. It identifies the uniform distribution of data representation over a unit hypersphere in the CSL representation space as the key contributor to this phenomenon. We establish that this increases model sensitivity to input perturbations in the presence of false negatives in the training data. Our finding is supported by extensive experiments for image and video classification using adversarial perturbations and other input corruptions. Building on the insights, we devise strategies that are simple, yet effective in improving model robustness with CSL training. We demonstrate up to 68% reduction in the performance gap between adversarially attacked CSL and its supervised counterpart. Finally, we contribute to robust CSL paradigm by incorporating our findings in adversarial self-supervised learning. We demonstrate an average gain of about 5% over two different state-of-the-art methods in this domain.      
### 67.Geodesic-Former: a Geodesic-Guided Few-shot 3D Point Cloud Instance Segmenter  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10859.pdf)
>  This paper introduces a new problem in 3D point cloud: few-shot instance segmentation. Given a few annotated point clouds exemplified a target class, our goal is to segment all instances of this target class in a query point cloud. This problem has a wide range of practical applications where point-wise instance segmentation annotation is prohibitively expensive to collect. To address this problem, we present Geodesic-Former -- the first geodesic-guided transformer for 3D point cloud instance segmentation. The key idea is to leverage the geodesic distance to tackle the density imbalance of LiDAR 3D point clouds. The LiDAR 3D point clouds are dense near the object surface and sparse or empty elsewhere making the Euclidean distance less effective to distinguish different objects. The geodesic distance, on the other hand, is more suitable since it encodes the scene's geometry which can be used as a guiding signal for the attention mechanism in a transformer decoder to generate kernels representing distinct features of instances. These kernels are then used in a dynamic convolution to obtain the final instance masks. To evaluate Geodesic-Former on the new task, we propose new splits of the two common 3D point cloud instance segmentation datasets: ScannetV2 and S3DIS. Geodesic-Former consistently outperforms strong baselines adapted from state-of-the-art 3D point cloud instance segmentation approaches with a significant margin.

### 68.Prototype-Guided Continual Adaptation for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10856.pdf)
>  This paper studies a new, practical but challenging problem, called Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA), where the labeled source domain contains all classes, but the classes in the unlabeled target domain increase sequentially. This problem is challenging due to two difficulties. First, source and target label sets are inconsistent at each time step, which makes it difficult to conduct accurate domain alignment. Second, previous target classes are unavailable in the current step, resulting in the forgetting of previous knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a novel Prototype-guided Continual Adaptation (ProCA) method, consisting of two solution strategies. 1) Label prototype identification: we identify target label prototypes by detecting shared classes with cumulative prediction probabilities of target samples. 2) Prototype-based alignment and replay: based on the identified label prototypes, we align both domains and enforce the model to retain previous knowledge. With these two strategies, ProCA is able to adapt the source model to a class-incremental unlabeled target domain effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of ProCA in resolving CI-UDA.

### 69.Spatio-Temporal Deformable Attention Network for Video Deblurring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10852.pdf)
>  The key success factor of the video deblurring methods is to compensate for the blurry pixels of the mid-frame with the sharp pixels of the adjacent video frames. Therefore, mainstream methods align the adjacent frames based on the estimated optical flows and fuse the alignment frames for restoration. However, these methods sometimes generate unsatisfactory results because they rarely consider the blur levels of pixels, which may introduce blurry pixels from video frames. Actually, not all the pixels in the video frames are sharp and beneficial for deblurring. To address this problem, we propose the spatio-temporal deformable attention network (STDANet) for video delurring, which extracts the information of sharp pixels by considering the pixel-wise blur levels of the video frames. Specifically, STDANet is an encoder-decoder network combined with the motion estimator and spatio-temporal deformable attention (STDA) module, where motion estimator predicts coarse optical flows that are used as base offsets to find the corresponding sharp pixels in STDA module. Experimental results indicate that the proposed STDANet performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro, DVD, and BSD datasets.      
### 70.Uncertainty-aware Multi-modal Learning via Cross-modal Random Network Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10851.pdf)
>  Multi-modal learning focuses on training models by equally combining multiple input data modalities during the prediction process. However, this equal combination can be detrimental to the prediction accuracy because different modalities are usually accompanied by varying levels of uncertainty. Using such uncertainty to combine modalities has been studied by a couple of approaches, but with limited success because these approaches are either designed to deal with specific classification or segmentation problems and cannot be easily translated into other tasks, or suffer from numerical instabilities. In this paper, we propose a new Uncertainty-aware Multi-modal Learner that estimates uncertainty by measuring feature density via Cross-modal Random Network Prediction (CRNP). CRNP is designed to require little adaptation to translate between different prediction tasks, while having a stable training process. From a technical point of view, CRNP is the first approach to explore random network prediction to estimate uncertainty and to combine multi-modal data. Experiments on two 3D multi-modal medical image segmentation tasks and three 2D multi-modal computer vision classification tasks show the effectiveness, adaptability and robustness of CRNP. Also, we provide an extensive discussion on different fusion functions and visualization to validate the proposed model.      
### 71.Few-shot Image Generation Using Discrete Content Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10833.pdf)
>  Few-shot image generation and few-shot image translation are two related tasks, both of which aim to generate new images for an unseen category with only a few images. In this work, we make the first attempt to adapt few-shot image translation method to few-shot image generation task. Few-shot image translation disentangles an image into style vector and content map. An unseen style vector can be combined with different seen content maps to produce different images. However, it needs to store seen images to provide content maps and the unseen style vector may be incompatible with seen content maps. To adapt it to few-shot image generation task, we learn a compact dictionary of local content vectors via quantizing continuous content maps into discrete content maps instead of storing seen images. Furthermore, we model the autoregressive distribution of discrete content map conditioned on style vector, which can alleviate the incompatibility between content map and style vector. Qualitative and quantitative results on three real datasets demonstrate that our model can produce images of higher diversity and fidelity for unseen categories than previous methods.      
### 72.Just Rotate it: Deploying Backdoor Attacks via Rotation Transformation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10825.pdf)
>  Recent works have demonstrated that deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks, where these attacks instill spurious correlations to external trigger patterns or objects (e.g., stickers, sunglasses, etc.). We find that such external trigger signals are unnecessary, as highly effective backdoors can be easily inserted using rotation-based image transformation. Our method constructs the poisoned dataset by rotating a limited amount of objects and labeling them incorrectly; once trained with it, the victim's model will make undesirable predictions during run-time inference. It exhibits a significantly high attack success rate while maintaining clean performance through comprehensive empirical studies on image classification and object detection tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate standard data augmentation techniques and four different backdoor defenses against our attack and find that none of them can serve as a consistent mitigation approach. Our attack can be easily deployed in the real world since it only requires rotating the object, as we show in both image classification and object detection applications. Overall, our work highlights a new, simple, physically realizable, and highly effective vector for backdoor attacks.

### 73.Test-Time Adaptation via Self-Training with Nearest Neighbor Information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10792.pdf)
>  Adapting trained classifiers using only online test data is important since it is difficult to access training data or future test data during test time. One of the popular approaches for test-time adaptation is self-training, which fine-tunes the trained classifiers using the classifier predictions of the test data as pseudo labels. However, under the test-time domain shift, self-training methods have a limitation that learning with inaccurate pseudo labels greatly degrades the performance of the adapted classifiers. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel test-time adaptation method Test-time Adaptation via Self-Training with nearest neighbor information (TAST). Based on the idea that a test data and its nearest neighbors in the embedding space of the trained classifier are more likely to have the same label, we adapt the trained classifier with the following two steps: (1) generate the pseudo label for the test data using its nearest neighbors from a set composed of previous test data, and (2) fine-tune the trained classifier with the pseudo label. Our experiments on two standard benchmarks, i.e., domain generalization and image corruption benchmarks, show that TAST outperforms the current state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods.      
### 74.Inductive and Transductive Few-Shot Video Classification via Appearance and Temporal Alignments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10785.pdf)
>  We present a novel method for few-shot video classification, which performs appearance and temporal alignments. In particular, given a pair of query and support videos, we conduct appearance alignment via frame-level feature matching to achieve the appearance similarity score between the videos, while utilizing temporal order-preserving priors for obtaining the temporal similarity score between the videos. Moreover, we introduce a few-shot video classification framework that leverages the above appearance and temporal similarity scores across multiple steps, namely prototype-based training and testing as well as inductive and transductive prototype refinement. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to explore transductive few-shot video classification. Extensive experiments on both Kinetics and Something-Something V2 datasets show that both appearance and temporal alignments are crucial for datasets with temporal order sensitivity such as Something-Something V2. Our approach achieves similar or better results than previous methods on both datasets.

### 75.An advanced combination of semi-supervised Normalizing Flow &amp; Yolo (YoloNF) to detect and recognize vehicle license plates  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10777.pdf)
>  Fully Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) has been a frequent research topic due to several practical applications. However, many of the current solutions are still not robust enough in real situations, commonly depending on many constraints. This paper presents a robust and efficient ALPR system based on the state-of-the-art YOLO object detector and Normalizing flows. The model uses two new strategies. Firstly, a two-stage network using YOLO and a normalization flow-based model for normalization to detect Licenses Plates (LP) and recognize the LP with numbers and Arabic characters. Secondly, Multi-scale image transformations are implemented to provide a solution to the problem of the YOLO cropped LP detection including significant background noise. Furthermore, extensive experiments are led on a new dataset with realistic scenarios, we introduce a larger public annotated dataset collected from Moroccan plates. We demonstrate that our proposed model can learn on a small number of samples free of single or multiple characters. The dataset will also be made publicly available to encourage further studies and research on plate detection and recognition.      
### 76.Auto-regressive Image Synthesis with Integrated Quantization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10776.pdf)
>  Deep generative models have achieved conspicuous progress in realistic image synthesis with multifarious conditional inputs, while generating diverse yet high-fidelity images remains a grand challenge in conditional image generation. This paper presents a versatile framework for conditional image generation which incorporates the inductive bias of CNNs and powerful sequence modeling of auto-regression that naturally leads to diverse image generation. Instead of independently quantizing the features of multiple domains as in prior research, we design an integrated quantization scheme with a variational regularizer that mingles the feature discretization in multiple domains, and markedly boosts the auto-regressive modeling performance. Notably, the variational regularizer enables to regularize feature distributions in incomparable latent spaces by penalizing the intra-domain variations of distributions. In addition, we design a Gumbel sampling strategy that allows to incorporate distribution uncertainty into the auto-regressive training procedure. The Gumbel sampling substantially mitigates the exposure bias that often incurs misalignment between the training and inference stages and severely impairs the inference performance. Extensive experiments over multiple conditional image generation tasks show that our method achieves superior diverse image generation performance qualitatively and quantitatively as compared with the state-of-the-art.      
### 77.Focused Decoding Enables 3D Anatomical Detection by Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10774.pdf)
>  Detection Transformers represent end-to-end object detection approaches based on a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, exploiting the attention mechanism for global relation modeling. Although Detection Transformers deliver results on par with or even superior to their highly optimized CNN-based counterparts operating on 2D natural images, their success is closely coupled to access to a vast amount of training data. This, however, restricts the feasibility of employing Detection Transformers in the medical domain, as access to annotated data is typically limited. To tackle this issue and facilitate the advent of medical Detection Transformers, we propose a novel Detection Transformer for 3D anatomical structure detection, dubbed Focused Decoder. Focused Decoder leverages information from an anatomical region atlas to simultaneously deploy query anchors and restrict the cross-attention's field of view to regions of interest, which allows for a precise focus on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate our proposed approach on two publicly available CT datasets and demonstrate that Focused Decoder not only provides strong detection results and thus alleviates the need for a vast amount of annotated data but also exhibits exceptional and highly intuitive explainability of results via attention weights. Code for Focused Decoder is available in our medical Vision Transformer library <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://github.com/bwittmann/transoar" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a>.      
### 78.Towards Interpretable Video Super-Resolution via Alternating Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10765.pdf)
>  In this paper, we study a practical space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) problem which aims at generating a high-framerate high-resolution sharp video from a low-framerate low-resolution blurry video. Such problem often occurs when recording a fast dynamic event with a low-framerate and low-resolution camera, and the captured video would suffer from three typical issues: i) motion blur occurs due to object/camera motions during exposure time; ii) motion aliasing is unavoidable when the event temporal frequency exceeds the Nyquist limit of temporal sampling; iii) high-frequency details are lost because of the low spatial sampling rate. These issues can be alleviated by a cascade of three separate sub-tasks, including video deblurring, frame interpolation, and super-resolution, which, however, would fail to capture the spatial and temporal correlations among video sequences. To address this, we propose an interpretable STVSR framework by leveraging both model-based and learning-based methods. Specifically, we formulate STVSR as a joint video deblurring, frame interpolation, and super-resolution problem, and solve it as two sub-problems in an alternate way. For the first sub-problem, we derive an interpretable analytical solution and use it as a Fourier data transform layer. Then, we propose a recurrent video enhancement layer for the second sub-problem to further recover high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality.      
### 79.MeshLoc: Mesh-Based Visual Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10762.pdf)
>  Visual localization, i.e., the problem of camera pose estimation, is a central component of applications such as autonomous robots and augmented reality systems. A dominant approach in the literature, shown to scale to large scenes and to handle complex illumination and seasonal changes, is based on local features extracted from images. The scene representation is a sparse Structure-from-Motion point cloud that is tied to a specific local feature. Switching to another feature type requires an expensive feature matching step between the database images used to construct the point cloud. In this work, we thus explore a more flexible alternative based on dense 3D meshes that does not require features matching between database images to build the scene representation. We show that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art results. We further show that surprisingly competitive results can be obtained when extracting features on renderings of these meshes, without any neural rendering stage, and even when rendering raw scene geometry without color or texture. Our results show that dense 3D model-based representations are a promising alternative to existing representations and point to interesting and challenging directions for future research.      
### 80.TIDEE: Tidying Up Novel Rooms using Visuo-Semantic Commonsense Priors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10761.pdf)
>  We introduce TIDEE, an embodied agent that tidies up a disordered scene based on learned commonsense object placement and room arrangement priors. TIDEE explores a home environment, detects objects that are out of their natural place, infers plausible object contexts for them, localizes such contexts in the current scene, and repositions the objects. Commonsense priors are encoded in three modules: i) visuo-semantic detectors that detect out-of-place objects, ii) an associative neural graph memory of objects and spatial relations that proposes plausible semantic receptacles and surfaces for object repositions, and iii) a visual search network that guides the agent's exploration for efficiently localizing the receptacle-of-interest in the current scene to reposition the object. We test TIDEE on tidying up disorganized scenes in the AI2THOR simulation environment. TIDEE carries out the task directly from pixel and raw depth input without ever having observed the same room beforehand, relying only on priors learned from a separate set of training houses. Human evaluations on the resulting room reorganizations show TIDEE outperforms ablative versions of the model that do not use one or more of the commonsense priors. On a related room rearrangement benchmark that allows the agent to view the goal state prior to rearrangement, a simplified version of our model significantly outperforms a top-performing method by a large margin.

### 81.DEVIANT: Depth EquiVarIAnt NeTwork for Monocular 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10758.pdf)
>  Modern neural networks use building blocks such as convolutions that are equivariant to arbitrary 2D translations. However, these vanilla blocks are not equivariant to arbitrary 3D translations in the projective manifold. Even then, all monocular 3D detectors use vanilla blocks to obtain the 3D coordinates, a task for which the vanilla blocks are not designed for. This paper takes the first step towards convolutions equivariant to arbitrary 3D translations in the projective manifold. Since the depth is the hardest to estimate for monocular detection, this paper proposes Depth EquiVarIAnt NeTwork (DEVIANT) built with existing scale equivariant steerable blocks. As a result, DEVIANT is equivariant to the depth translations in the projective manifold whereas vanilla networks are not. The additional depth equivariance forces the DEVIANT to learn consistent depth estimates, and therefore, DEVIANT achieves state-of-the-art monocular 3D detection results on KITTI and Waymo datasets in the image-only category and performs competitively to methods using extra information. Moreover, DEVIANT works better than vanilla networks in cross-dataset evaluation.

### 82.Irrelevant Pixels are Everywhere: Find and Exclude Them for More Efficient Computer Vision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10741.pdf)
>  Computer vision is often performed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are compute-intensive and challenging to deploy on power-contrained systems such as mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. CNNs are compute-intensive because they indiscriminately compute many features on all pixels of the input image. We observe that, given a computer vision task, images often contain pixels that are irrelevant to the task. For example, if the task is looking for cars, pixels in the sky are not very useful. Therefore, we propose that a CNN be modified to only operate on relevant pixels to save computation and energy. We propose a method to study three popular computer vision datasets, finding that 48% of pixels are irrelevant. We also propose the focused convolution to modify a CNN's convolutional layers to reject the pixels that are marked irrelevant. On an embedded device, we observe no loss in accuracy, while inference latency, energy consumption, and multiply-add count are all reduced by about 45%.      
### 83.Fusing Frame and Event Vision for High-speed Optical Flow for Edge Application  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10720.pdf)
>  Optical flow computation with frame-based cameras provides high accuracy but the speed is limited either by the model size of the algorithm or by the frame rate of the camera. This makes it inadequate for high-speed applications. Event cameras provide continuous asynchronous event streams overcoming the frame-rate limitation. However, the algorithms for processing the data either borrow frame like setup limiting the speed or suffer from lower accuracy. We fuse the complementary accuracy and speed advantages of the frame and event-based pipelines to provide high-speed optical flow while maintaining a low error rate. Our bio-mimetic network is validated with the MVSEC dataset showing 19% error degradation at 4x speed up. We then demonstrate the system with a high-speed drone flight scenario where a high-speed event camera computes the flow even before the optical camera sees the drone making it suited for applications like tracking and segmentation. This work shows the fundamental trade-offs in frame-based processing may be overcome by fusing data from other modalities.      
### 84.Synthetic Dataset Generation for Adversarial Machine Learning Research  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10719.pdf)
>  Existing adversarial example research focuses on digitally inserted perturbations on top of existing natural image datasets. This construction of adversarial examples is not realistic because it may be difficult, or even impossible, for an attacker to deploy such an attack in the real-world due to sensing and environmental effects. To better understand adversarial examples against cyber-physical systems, we propose approximating the real-world through simulation. In this paper we describe our synthetic dataset generation tool that enables scalable collection of such a synthetic dataset with realistic adversarial examples. We use the CARLA simulator to collect such a dataset and demonstrate simulated attacks that undergo the same environmental transforms and processing as real-world images. Our tools have been used to collect datasets to help evaluate the efficacy of adversarial examples, and can be found at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/pull/4992" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 85.R2P: A Deep Learning Model from mmWave Radar to Point Cloud  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10690.pdf)
>  Recent research has shown the effectiveness of mmWave radar sensing for object detection in low visibility environments, which makes it an ideal technique in autonomous navigation systems. In this paper, we introduce Radar to Point Cloud (R2P), a deep learning model that generates smooth, dense, and highly accurate point cloud representation of a 3D object with fine geometry details, based on rough and sparse point clouds with incorrect points obtained from mmWave radar. These input point clouds are converted from the 2D depth images that are generated from raw mmWave radar sensor data, characterized by inconsistency, and orientation and shape errors. R2P utilizes an architecture of two sequential deep learning encoder-decoder blocks to extract the essential features of those radar-based input point clouds of an object when observed from multiple viewpoints, and to ensure the internal consistency of a generated output point cloud and its accurate and detailed shape reconstruction of the original object. We implement R2P to replace Stage 2 of our recently proposed 3DRIMR (3D Reconstruction and Imaging via mmWave Radar) system. Our experiments demonstrate the significant performance improvement of R2P over the popular existing methods such as PointNet, PCN, and the original 3DRIMR design.      
### 86.Large-Kernel Attention for 3D Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11225.pdf)
>  Automatic segmentation of multiple organs and tumors from 3D medical images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans using deep learning methods can aid in diagnosing and treating cancer. However, organs often overlap and are complexly connected, characterized by extensive anatomical variation and low contrast. In addition, the diversity of tumor shape, location, and appearance, coupled with the dominance of background voxels, makes accurate 3D medical image segmentation difficult. In this paper, a novel large-kernel (LK) attention module is proposed to address these problems to achieve accurate multi-organ segmentation and tumor segmentation. The advantages of convolution and self-attention are combined in the proposed LK attention module, including local contextual information, long-range dependence, and channel adaptation. The module also decomposes the LK convolution to optimize the computational cost and can be easily incorporated into FCNs such as U-Net. Comprehensive ablation experiments demonstrated the feasibility of convolutional decomposition and explored the most efficient and effective network design. Among them, the best Mid-type LK attention-based U-Net network was evaluated on CT-ORG and BraTS 2020 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance. The performance improvement due to the proposed LK attention module was also statistically validated.      
### 87.Improved $α$-GAN architecture for generating 3D connected volumes with an application to radiosurgery treatment planning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11223.pdf)
>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained significant attention in several computer vision tasks for generating high-quality synthetic data. Various medical applications including diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy can benefit greatly from synthetic data generation due to data scarcity in the domain. However, medical image data is typically kept in 3D space, and generative models suffer from the curse of dimensionality issues in generating such synthetic data. In this paper, we investigate the potential of GANs for generating connected 3D volumes. We propose an improved version of 3D $\alpha$-GAN by incorporating various architectural enhancements. On a synthetic dataset of connected 3D spheres and ellipsoids, our model can generate fully connected 3D shapes with similar geometrical characteristics to that of training data. We also show that our 3D GAN model can successfully generate high-quality 3D tumor volumes and associated treatment specifications (e.g., isocenter locations). Similar moment invariants to the training data as well as fully connected 3D shapes confirm that improved 3D $\alpha$-GAN implicitly learns the training data distribution, and generates realistic-looking samples. The capability of improved 3D $\alpha$-GAN makes it a valuable source for generating synthetic medical image data that can help future research in this domain.      
### 88.Human Treelike Tubular Structure Segmentation: A Comprehensive Review and Future Perspectives  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11203.pdf)
>  Various structures in human physiology follow a treelike morphology, which often expresses complexity at very fine scales. Examples of such structures are intrathoracic airways, retinal blood vessels, and hepatic blood vessels. Large collections of 2D and 3D images have been made available by medical imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and ultrasound in which the spatial arrangement can be observed. Segmentation of these structures in medical imaging is of great importance since the analysis of the structure provides insights into disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis. Manually labelling extensive data by radiologists is often time-consuming and error-prone. As a result, automated or semi-automated computational models have become a popular research field of medical imaging in the past two decades, and many have been developed to date. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of currently publicly available datasets, segmentation algorithms, and evaluation metrics. In addition, current challenges and future research directions are discussed.      
### 89.Fast strategies for multi-temporal speckle reduction of Sentinel-1 GRD images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11111.pdf)
>  Reducing speckle and limiting the variations of the physical parameters in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is often a key-step to fully exploit the potential of such data. Nowadays, deep learning approaches produce state of the art results in single-image SAR restoration. Nevertheless, huge multi-temporal stacks are now often available and could be efficiently exploited to further improve image quality. This paper explores two fast strategies employing a single-image despeckling algorithm, namely SAR2SAR, in a multi-temporal framework. The first one is based on Quegan filter and replaces the local reflectivity pre-estimation by SAR2SAR. The second one uses SAR2SAR to suppress speckle from a ratio image encoding the multi-temporal information under the form of a "super-image", i.e. the temporal arithmetic mean of a time series. Experimental results on Sentinel-1 GRD data show that these two multi-temporal strategies provide improved filtering results while adding a limited computational cost.      
### 90.Physiology-based simulation of the retinal vasculature enables annotation-free segmentation of OCT angiographs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11102.pdf)
>  Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) can non-invasively image the eye's circulatory system. In order to reliably characterize the retinal vasculature, there is a need to automatically extract quantitative metrics from these images. The calculation of such biomarkers requires a precise semantic segmentation of the blood vessels. However, deep-learning-based methods for segmentation mostly rely on supervised training with voxel-level annotations, which are costly to obtain. In this work, we present a pipeline to synthesize large amounts of realistic OCTA images with intrinsically matching ground truth labels; thereby obviating the need for manual annotation of training data. Our proposed method is based on two novel components: 1) a physiology-based simulation that models the various retinal vascular plexuses and 2) a suite of physics-based image augmentations that emulate the OCTA image acquisition process including typical artifacts. In extensive benchmarking experiments, we demonstrate the utility of our synthetic data by successfully training retinal vessel segmentation algorithms. Encouraged by our method's competitive quantitative and superior qualitative performance, we believe that it constitutes a versatile tool to advance the quantitative analysis of OCTA images.      
### 91.Multi-temporal speckle reduction with self-supervised deep neural networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11095.pdf)
>  Speckle filtering is generally a prerequisite to the analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Tremendous progress has been achieved in the domain of single-image despeckling. Latest techniques rely on deep neural networks to restore the various structures and textures peculiar to SAR images. The availability of time series of SAR images offers the possibility of improving speckle filtering by combining different speckle realizations over the same area. The supervised training of deep neural networks requires ground-truth speckle-free images. Such images can only be obtained indirectly through some form of averaging, by spatial or temporal integration, and are imperfect. Given the potential of very high quality restoration reachable by multi-temporal speckle filtering, the limitations of ground-truth images need to be circumvented. We extend a recent self-supervised training strategy for single-look complex SAR images, called MERLIN, to the case of multi-temporal filtering. This requires modeling the sources of statistical dependencies in the spatial and temporal dimensions as well as between the real and imaginary components of the complex amplitudes. Quantitative analysis on datasets with simulated speckle indicates a clear improvement of speckle reduction when additional SAR images are included. Our method is then applied to stacks of TerraSAR-X images and shown to outperform competing multi-temporal speckle filtering approaches.

### 92.Graph Spatio-Spectral Total Variation Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11050.pdf)
>  The spatio-spectral total variation (SSTV) model has been widely used as an effective regularization of hyperspectral images (HSI) for various applications such as mixed noise removal. However, since SSTV computes local spatial differences uniformly, it is difficult to remove noise while preserving complex spatial structures with fine edges and textures, especially in situations of high noise intensity. To solve this problem, we propose a new TV-type regularization called Graph-SSTV (GSSTV), which generates a graph explicitly reflecting the spatial structure of the target HSI from noisy HSIs and incorporates a weighted spatial difference operator designed based on this graph. Furthermore, we formulate the mixed noise removal problem as a convex optimization problem involving GSSTV and develop an efficient algorithm based on the primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GSSTV compared with existing HSI regularization models through experiments on mixed noise removal.

### 93.GesSure -- A Robust Face-Authentication enabled Dynamic Gesture Recognition GUI Application  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11033.pdf)
>  Using physical interactive devices like mouse and keyboards hinders naturalistic human-machine interaction and increases the probability of surface contact during a pandemic. Existing gesture-recognition systems do not possess user authentication, making them unreliable. Static gestures in current gesture-recognition technology introduce long adaptation periods and reduce user compatibility. Our technology places a strong emphasis on user recognition and safety. We use meaningful and relevant gestures for task operation, resulting in a better user experience. This paper aims to design a robust, face-verification-enabled gesture recognition system that utilizes a graphical user interface and primarily focuses on security through user recognition and authorization. The face model uses MTCNN and FaceNet to verify the user, and our LSTM-CNN architecture for gesture recognition, achieving an accuracy of 95% with five classes of gestures. The prototype developed through our research has successfully executed context-dependent tasks like save, print, control video-player operations and exit, and context-free operating system tasks like sleep, shut-down, and unlock intuitively. Our application and dataset are available as open source.      
### 94.Rapid Lung Ultrasound COVID-19 Severity Scoring with Resource-Efficient Deep Feature Extraction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10998.pdf)
>  Artificial intelligence-based analysis of lung ultrasound imaging has been demonstrated as an effective technique for rapid diagnostic decision support throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such techniques can require days- or weeks-long training processes and hyper-parameter tuning to develop intelligent deep learning image analysis models. This work focuses on leveraging 'off-the-shelf' pre-trained models as deep feature extractors for scoring disease severity with minimal training time. We propose using pre-trained initializations of existing methods ahead of simple and compact neural networks to reduce reliance on computational capacity. This reduction of computational capacity is of critical importance in time-limited or resource-constrained circumstances, such as the early stages of a pandemic. On a dataset of 49 patients, comprising over 20,000 images, we demonstrate that the use of existing methods as feature extractors results in the effective classification of COVID-19-related pneumonia severity while requiring only minutes of training time. Our methods can achieve an accuracy of over 0.93 on a 4-level severity score scale and provides comparable per-patient region and global scores compared to expert annotated ground truths. These results demonstrate the capability for rapid deployment and use of such minimally-adapted methods for progress monitoring, patient stratification and management in clinical practice for COVID-19 patients, and potentially in other respiratory diseases.      
### 95.Principal Geodesic Analysis of Merge Trees (and Persistence Diagrams)  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10960.pdf)
>  This paper presents a computational framework for the Principal Geodesic Analysis of merge trees (MT-PGA), a novel adaptation of the celebrated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) framework [87] to the Wasserstein metric space of merge trees [92]. We formulate MT-PGA computation as a constrained optimization problem, aiming at adjusting a basis of orthogonal geodesic axes, while minimizing a fitting energy. We introduce an efficient, iterative algorithm which exploits shared-memory parallelism, as well as an analytic expression of the fitting energy gradient, to ensure fast iterations. Our approach also trivially extends to extremum persistence diagrams. Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our approach - with MT-PGA computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples. We show the utility of our contributions by extending to merge trees two typical PCA applications. First, we apply MT-PGA to data reduction and reliably compress merge trees by concisely representing them by their first coordinates in the MT-PGA basis. Second, we present a dimensionality reduction framework exploiting the first two directions of the MT-PGA basis to generate two-dimensional layouts of the ensemble. We augment these layouts with persistence correlation views, enabling global and local visual inspections of the feature variability in the ensemble. In both applications, quantitative experiments assess the relevance of our framework. Finally, we provide a lightweight C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.      
### 96.Dense RGB-D-Inertial SLAM with Map Deformations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10940.pdf)
>  While dense visual SLAM methods are capable of estimating dense reconstructions of the environment, they suffer from a lack of robustness in their tracking step, especially when the optimisation is poorly initialised. Sparse visual SLAM systems have attained high levels of accuracy and robustness through the inclusion of inertial measurements in a tightly-coupled fusion. Inspired by this performance, we propose the first tightly-coupled dense RGB-D-inertial SLAM system. <br>Our system has real-time capability while running on a GPU. It jointly optimises for the camera pose, velocity, IMU biases and gravity direction while building up a globally consistent, fully dense surfel-based 3D reconstruction of the environment. Through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets, we show that our dense visual-inertial SLAM system is more robust to fast motions and periods of low texture and low geometric variation than a related RGB-D-only SLAM system.      
### 97.XAI based Performance Preserving Adaptive Image Compression for Efficient Satellite Communication  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10885.pdf)
>  In the era of multinational cooperation, gathering and analyzing the satellite images are getting easier and more important. Typical procedure of the satellite image analysis include transmission of the bulky image data from satellite to the ground producing significant overhead. To reduce the amount of the transmission overhead while making no harm to the analysis result, we propose a novel image compression scheme RDIC in this paper. RDIC is a reasoning based image compression scheme that compresses an image according to the pixel importance score acquired from the analysis model itself. From the experimental results we showed that our RDIC scheme successfully captures the important regions in an image showing high compression rate and low accuracy loss.      
### 98.Optimizing Image Compression via Joint Learning with Denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10869.pdf)
>  High levels of noise usually exist in today's captured images due to the relatively small sensors equipped in the smartphone cameras, where the noise brings extra challenges to lossy image compression algorithms. Without the capacity to tell the difference between image details and noise, general image compression methods allocate additional bits to explicitly store the undesired image noise during compression and restore the unpleasant noisy image during decompression. Based on the observations, we optimize the image compression algorithm to be noise-aware as joint denoising and compression to resolve the bits misallocation problem. The key is to transform the original noisy images to noise-free bits by eliminating the undesired noise during compression, where the bits are later decompressed as clean images. Specifically, we propose a novel two-branch, weight-sharing architecture with plug-in feature denoisers to allow a simple and effective realization of the goal with little computational cost. Experimental results show that our method gains a significant improvement over the existing baseline methods on both the synthetic and real-world datasets.

### 99.Neuroimaging Feature Extraction using a Neural Network Classifier for Imaging Genetics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10794.pdf)
>  A major issue in the association of genes to neuroimaging phenotypes is the high dimension of both genetic data and neuroimaging data. In this article, we tackle the latter problem with an eye toward developing solutions that are relevant for disease prediction. Supported by a vast literature on the predictive power of neural networks, our proposed solution uses neural networks to extract from neuroimaging data features that are relevant for predicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for subsequent relation to genetics. Our neuroimaging-genetic pipeline is comprised of image processing, neuroimaging feature extraction and genetic association steps. We propose a neural network classifier for extracting neuroimaging features that are related with disease and a multivariate Bayesian group sparse regression model for genetic association. We compare the predictive power of these features to expert selected features and take a closer look at the SNPs identified with the new neuroimaging features.      
### 100.Strategising template-guided needle placement for MR-targeted prostate biopsy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10784.pdf)
>  Clinically significant prostate cancer has a better chance to be sampled during ultrasound-guided biopsy procedures, if suspected lesions found in pre-operative magnetic resonance (MR) images are used as targets. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the biopsy procedure is limited by the operator-dependent skills and experience in sampling the targets, a sequential decision making process that involves navigating an ultrasound probe and placing a series of sampling needles for potentially multiple targets. This work aims to learn a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that optimises the actions of continuous positioning of 2D ultrasound views and biopsy needles with respect to a guiding template, such that the MR targets can be sampled efficiently and sufficiently. We first formulate the task as a Markov decision process (MDP) and construct an environment that allows the targeting actions to be performed virtually for individual patients, based on their anatomy and lesions derived from MR images. A patient-specific policy can thus be optimised, before each biopsy procedure, by rewarding positive sampling in the MDP environment. Experiment results from fifty four prostate cancer patients show that the proposed RL-learned policies obtained a mean hit rate of 93% and an average cancer core length of 11 mm, which compared favourably to two alternative baseline strategies designed by humans, without hand-engineered rewards that directly maximise these clinically relevant metrics. Perhaps more interestingly, it is found that the RL agents learned strategies that were adaptive to the lesion size, where spread of the needles was prioritised for smaller lesions. Such a strategy has not been previously reported or commonly adopted in clinical practice, but led to an overall superior targeting performance when compared with intuitively designed strategies.
