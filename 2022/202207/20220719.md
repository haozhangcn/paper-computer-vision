### 1.Adversarial Pixel Restoration as a Pretext Task for Transferable Perturbations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08803.pdf)
>  Transferable adversarial attacks optimize adversaries from a pretrained surrogate model and known label space to fool the unknown black-box models. Therefore, these attacks are restricted by the availability of an effective surrogate model. In this work, we relax this assumption and propose Adversarial Pixel Restoration as a self-supervised alternative to train an effective surrogate model from scratch under the condition of no labels and few data samples. Our training approach is based on a min-max objective which reduces overfitting via an adversarial objective and thus optimizes for a more generalizable surrogate model. Our proposed attack is complimentary to our adversarial pixel restoration and is independent of any task specific objective as it can be launched in a self-supervised manner. We successfully demonstrate the adversarial transferability of our approach to Vision Transformers as well as Convolutional Neural Networks for the tasks of classification, object detection, and video segmentation.

### 2.DeFlowSLAM: Self-Supervised Scene Motion Decomposition for Dynamic Dense SLAM  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08794.pdf)
>  We present a novel dual-flow representation of scene motion that decomposes the optical flow into a static flow field caused by the camera motion and another dynamic flow field caused by the objects' movements in the scene. Based on this representation, we present a dynamic SLAM, dubbed DeFlowSLAM, that exploits both static and dynamic pixels in the images to solve the camera poses, rather than simply using static background pixels as other dynamic SLAM systems do. We propose a dynamic update module to train our DeFlowSLAM in a self-supervised manner, where a dense bundle adjustment layer takes in estimated static flow fields and the weights controlled by the dynamic mask and outputs the residual of the optimized static flow fields, camera poses, and inverse depths. The static and dynamic flow fields are estimated by warping the current image to the neighboring images, and the optical flow can be obtained by summing the two fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeFlowSLAM generalizes well to both static and dynamic scenes as it exhibits comparable performance to the state-of-the-art DROID-SLAM in static and less dynamic scenes while significantly outperforming DROID-SLAM in highly dynamic environments.

### 3.Instance-Aware Observer Network for Out-of-Distribution Object Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08782.pdf)
>  Recent work on Observer Network has shown promising results on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection for semantic segmentation. These methods have difficulty in precisely locating the point of interest in the image, i.e, the anomaly. This limitation is due to the difficulty of fine-grained prediction at the pixel level. To address this issue, we provide instance knowledge to the observer. We extend the approach of ObsNet by harnessing an instance-wise mask prediction. We use an additional, class agnostic, object detector to filter and aggregate observer predictions. Finally, we predict an unique anomaly score for each instance in the image. We show that our proposed method accurately disentangle in-distribution objects from Out-Of-Distribution objects on three datasets.      
### 4.Rethinking Data Augmentation for Robust Visual Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08739.pdf)
>  Data Augmentation (DA) -- generating extra training samples beyond original training set -- has been widely-used in today's unbiased VQA models to mitigate the language biases. Current mainstream DA strategies are synthetic-based methods, which synthesize new samples by either editing some visual regions/words, or re-generating them from scratch. However, these synthetic samples are always unnatural and error-prone. To avoid this issue, a recent DA work composes new augmented samples by randomly pairing pristine images and other human-written questions. Unfortunately, to guarantee augmented samples have reasonable ground-truth answers, they manually design a set of heuristic rules for several question types, which extremely limits its generalization abilities. To this end, we propose a new Knowledge Distillation based Data Augmentation for VQA, dubbed KDDAug. Specifically, we first relax the requirements of reasonable image-question pairs, which can be easily applied to any question types. Then, we design a knowledge distillation (KD) based answer assignment to generate pseudo answers for all composed image-question pairs, which are robust to both in-domain and out-of-distribution settings. Since KDDAug is a model-agnostic DA strategy, it can be seamlessly incorporated into any VQA architectures. Extensive ablation studies on multiple backbones and benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization abilities of KDDAug.      
### 5.Towards Diverse and Faithful One-shot Adaption of Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08736.pdf)
>  One-shot generative domain adaption aims to transfer a pre-trained generator on one domain to a new domain using one reference image only. However, it remains very challenging for the adapted generator (i) to generate diverse images inherited from the pre-trained generator while (ii) faithfully acquiring the domain-specific attributes and styles of the reference image. In this paper, we present a novel one-shot generative domain adaption method, i.e., DiFa, for diverse generation and faithful adaptation. For global-level adaptation, we leverage the difference between the CLIP embedding of reference image and the mean embedding of source images to constrain the target generator. For local-level adaptation, we introduce an attentive style loss which aligns each intermediate token of adapted image with its corresponding token of the reference image. To facilitate diverse generation, selective cross-domain consistency is introduced to select and retain the domain-sharing attributes in the editing latent $\mathcal{W}+$ space to inherit the diversity of pre-trained generator. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially for the cases of large domain gaps. Moreover, our DiFa can easily be extended to zero-shot generative domain adaption with appealing results.

### 6.Temporal Lift Pooling for Continuous Sign Language Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08734.pdf)
>  Pooling methods are necessities for modern neural networks for increasing receptive fields and lowering down computational costs. However, commonly used hand-crafted pooling approaches, e.g., max pooling and average pooling, may not well preserve discriminative features. While many researchers have elaborately designed various pooling variants in spatial domain to handle these limitations with much progress, the temporal aspect is rarely visited where directly applying hand-crafted methods or these specialized spatial variants may not be optimal. In this paper, we derive temporal lift pooling (TLP) from the Lifting Scheme in signal processing to intelligently downsample features of different temporal hierarchies. The Lifting Scheme factorizes input signals into various sub-bands with different frequency, which can be viewed as different temporal movement patterns. Our TLP is a three-stage procedure, which performs signal decomposition, component weighting and information fusion to generate a refined downsized feature map. We select a typical temporal task with long sequences, i.e. continuous sign language recognition (CSLR), as our testbed to verify the effectiveness of TLP. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show TLP outperforms hand-crafted methods and specialized spatial variants by a large margin (1.5%) with similar computational overhead. As a robust feature extractor, TLP exhibits great generalizability upon multiple backbones on various datasets and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two large-scale CSLR datasets. Visualizations further demonstrate the mechanism of TLP in correcting gloss borders. Code is released.      
### 7.Semantic Novelty Detection via Relational Reasoning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08699.pdf)
>  Semantic novelty detection aims at discovering unknown categories in the test data. This task is particularly relevant in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving or healthcare, where it is crucial to recognize unknown objects at deployment time and issue a warning to the user accordingly. Despite the impressive advancements of deep learning research, existing models still need a finetuning stage on the known categories in order to recognize the unknown ones. This could be prohibitive when privacy rules limit data access, or in case of strict memory and computational constraints (e.g. edge computing). We claim that a tailored representation learning strategy may be the right solution for effective and efficient semantic novelty detection. Besides extensively testing state-of-the-art approaches for this task, we propose a novel representation learning paradigm based on relational reasoning. It focuses on learning how to measure semantic similarity rather than recognizing known categories. Our experiments show that this knowledge is directly transferable to a wide range of scenarios, and it can be exploited as a plug-and-play module to convert closed-set recognition models into reliable open-set ones.      
### 8.Quality Assessment of Image Super-Resolution: Balancing Deterministic and Statistical Fidelity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08689.pdf)
>  There has been a growing interest in developing image super-resolution (SR) algorithms that convert low-resolution (LR) to higher resolution images, but automatically evaluating the visual quality of super-resolved images remains a challenging problem. Here we look at the problem of SR image quality assessment (SR IQA) in a two-dimensional (2D) space of deterministic fidelity (DF) versus statistical fidelity (SF). This allows us to better understand the advantages and disadvantages of existing SR algorithms, which produce images at different clusters in the 2D space of (DF, SF). Specifically, we observe an interesting trend from more traditional SR algorithms that are typically inclined to optimize for DF while losing SF, to more recent generative adversarial network (GAN) based approaches that by contrast exhibit strong advantages in achieving high SF but sometimes appear weak at maintaining DF. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty weighting scheme based on content-dependent sharpness and texture assessment that merges the two fidelity measures into an overall quality prediction named the Super Resolution Image Fidelity (SRIF) index, which demonstrates superior performance against state-of-the-art IQA models when tested on subject-rated datasets.      
### 9.Label2Label: A Language Modeling Framework for Multi-Attribute Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08677.pdf)
>  Objects are usually associated with multiple attributes, and these attributes often exhibit high correlations. Modeling complex relationships between attributes poses a great challenge for multi-attribute learning. This paper proposes a simple yet generic framework named Label2Label to exploit the complex attribute correlations. Label2Label is the first attempt for multi-attribute prediction from the perspective of language modeling. Specifically, it treats each attribute label as a "word" describing the sample. As each sample is annotated with multiple attribute labels, these "words" will naturally form an unordered but meaningful "sentence", which depicts the semantic information of the corresponding sample. Inspired by the remarkable success of pre-training language models in NLP, Label2Label introduces an image-conditioned masked language model, which randomly masks some of the "word" tokens from the label "sentence" and aims to recover them based on the masked "sentence" and the context conveyed by image features. Our intuition is that the instance-wise attribute relations are well grasped if the neural net can infer the missing attributes based on the context and the remaining attribute hints. Label2Label is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. Without incorporating task-specific prior knowledge and highly specialized network designs, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three different multi-attribute learning tasks, compared to highly customized domain-specific methods.

### 10.Boosting Video Super Resolution with Patch-Based Temporal Redundancy Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08674.pdf)
>  The success of existing video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms stems mainly exploiting the temporal information from the neighboring frames. However, none of these methods have discussed the influence of the temporal redundancy in the patches with stationary objects and background and usually use all the information in the adjacent frames without any discrimination. In this paper, we observe that the temporal redundancy will bring adverse effect to the information propagation,which limits the performance of the most existing VSR methods. Motivated by this observation, we aim to improve existing VSR algorithms by handling the temporal redundancy patches in an optimized manner. We develop two simple yet effective plug and play methods to improve the performance of existing local and non-local propagation-based VSR algorithms on widely-used public videos. For more comprehensive evaluating the robustness and performance of existing VSR algorithms, we also collect a new dataset which contains a variety of public videos as testing set. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of existing VSR methods on the collected videos from wild scenarios while maintain their performance on existing commonly used datasets.

### 11.Action-based Contrastive Learning for Trajectory Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08664.pdf)
>  Trajectory prediction is an essential task for successful human robot interaction, such as in autonomous driving. In this work, we address the problem of predicting future pedestrian trajectories in a first person view setting with a moving camera. To that end, we propose a novel action-based contrastive learning loss, that utilizes pedestrian action information to improve the learned trajectory embeddings. The fundamental idea behind this new loss is that trajectories of pedestrians performing the same action should be closer to each other in the feature space than the trajectories of pedestrians with significantly different actions. In other words, we argue that behavioral information about pedestrian action influences their future trajectory. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling strategy for trajectories that is able to effectively increase negative and positive contrastive samples. Additional synthetic trajectory samples are generated using a trained Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which is at the core of several models developed for trajectory prediction. Results show that our proposed contrastive framework employs contextual information about pedestrian behavior, i.e. action, effectively, and it learns a better trajectory representation. Thus, integrating the proposed contrastive framework within a trajectory prediction model improves its results and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three trajectory prediction benchmarks [31, 32, 26].      
### 12.Towards High-Fidelity Single-view Holistic Reconstruction of Indoor Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08656.pdf)
>  We present a new framework to reconstruct holistic 3D indoor scenes including both room background and indoor objects from single-view images. Existing methods can only produce 3D shapes of indoor objects with limited geometry quality because of the heavy occlusion of indoor scenes. To solve this, we propose an instance-aligned implicit function (InstPIFu) for detailed object reconstruction. Combining with instance-aligned attention module, our method is empowered to decouple mixed local features toward the occluded instances. Additionally, unlike previous methods that simply represents the room background as a 3D bounding box, depth map or a set of planes, we recover the fine geometry of the background via implicit representation. Extensive experiments on the e SUN RGB-D, Pix3D, 3D-FUTURE, and 3D-FRONT datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both background and foreground object reconstruction. Our code and model will be made publicly available.      
### 13.Leveraging Action Affinity and Continuity for Semi-supervised Temporal Action Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08653.pdf)
>  We present a semi-supervised learning approach to the temporal action segmentation task. The goal of the task is to temporally detect and segment actions in long, untrimmed procedural videos, where only a small set of videos are densely labelled, and a large collection of videos are unlabelled. To this end, we propose two novel loss functions for the unlabelled data: an action affinity loss and an action continuity loss. The action affinity loss guides the unlabelled samples learning by imposing the action priors induced from the labelled set. Action continuity loss enforces the temporal continuity of actions, which also provides frame-wise classification supervision. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Boundary Smoothing (ABS) approach to build coarser action boundaries for more robust and reliable learning. The proposed loss functions and ABS were evaluated on three benchmarks. Results show that they significantly improved action segmentation performance with a low amount (5% and 10%) of labelled data and achieved comparable results to full supervision with 50% labelled data. Furthermore, ABS succeeded in boosting performance when integrated into fully-supervised learning.      
### 14.Latent Partition Implicit with Surface Codes for 3D Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08631.pdf)
>  Deep implicit functions have shown remarkable shape modeling ability in various 3D computer vision tasks. One drawback is that it is hard for them to represent a 3D shape as multiple parts. Current solutions learn various primitives and blend the primitives directly in the spatial space, which still struggle to approximate the 3D shape accurately. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel implicit representation to represent a single 3D shape as a set of parts in the latent space, towards both highly accurate and plausibly interpretable shape modeling. Our insight here is that both the part learning and the part blending can be conducted much easier in the latent space than in the spatial space. We name our method Latent Partition Implicit (LPI), because of its ability of casting the global shape modeling into multiple local part modeling, which partitions the global shape unity. LPI represents a shape as Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) using surface codes. Each surface code is a latent code representing a part whose center is on the surface, which enables us to flexibly employ intrinsic attributes of shapes or additional surface properties. Eventually, LPI can reconstruct both the shape and the parts on the shape, both of which are plausible meshes. LPI is a multi-level representation, which can partition a shape into different numbers of parts after training. LPI can be learned without ground truth signed distances, point normals or any supervision for part partition. LPI outperforms the latest methods under the widely used benchmarks in terms of reconstruction accuracy and modeling interpretability.

### 15.FakeCLR: Exploring Contrastive Learning for Solving Latent Discontinuity in Data-Efficient GANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08630.pdf)
>  Data-Efficient GANs (DE-GANs), which aim to learn generative models with a limited amount of training data, encounter several challenges for generating high-quality samples. Since data augmentation strategies have largely alleviated the training instability, how to further improve the generative performance of DE-GANs becomes a hotspot. Recently, contrastive learning has shown the great potential of increasing the synthesis quality of DE-GANs, yet related principles are not well explored. In this paper, we revisit and compare different contrastive learning strategies in DE-GANs, and identify (i) the current bottleneck of generative performance is the discontinuity of latent space; (ii) compared to other contrastive learning strategies, Instance-perturbation works towards latent space continuity, which brings the major improvement to DE-GANs. Based on these observations, we propose FakeCLR, which only applies contrastive learning on perturbed fake samples, and devises three related training techniques: Noise-related Latent Augmentation, Diversity-aware Queue, and Forgetting Factor of Queue. Our experimental results manifest the new state of the arts on both few-shot generation and limited-data generation. On multiple datasets, FakeCLR acquires more than 15% FID improvement compared to existing DE-GANs.

### 16.Unifying Event Detection and Captioning as Sequence Generation via Pre-Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08625.pdf)
>  Dense video captioning aims to generate corresponding text descriptions for a series of events in the untrimmed video, which can be divided into two sub-tasks, event detection and event captioning. Unlike previous works that tackle the two sub-tasks separately, recent works have focused on enhancing the inter-task association between the two sub-tasks. However, designing inter-task interactions for event detection and captioning is not trivial due to the large differences in their task specific solutions. Besides, previous event detection methods normally ignore temporal dependencies between events, leading to event redundancy or inconsistency problems. To tackle above the two defects, in this paper, we define event detection as a sequence generation task and propose a unified pre-training and fine-tuning framework to naturally enhance the inter-task association between event detection and captioning. Since the model predicts each event with previous events as context, the inter-dependency between events is fully exploited and thus our model can detect more diverse and consistent events in the video. Experiments on the ActivityNet dataset show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and can be further boosted when pre-trained on extra large-scale video-text data.

### 17.ExAgt: Expert-guided Augmentation for Representation Learning of Traffic Scenarios  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08609.pdf)
>  Representation learning in recent years has been addressed with self-supervised learning methods. The input data is augmented into two distorted views and an encoder learns the representations that are invariant to distortions -- cross-view prediction. Augmentation is one of the key components in cross-view self-supervised learning frameworks to learn visual representations. This paper presents ExAgt, a novel method to include expert knowledge for augmenting traffic scenarios, to improve the learnt representations without any human annotation. The expert-guided augmentations are generated in an automated fashion based on the infrastructure, the interactions between the EGO and the traffic participants and an ideal sensor model. The ExAgt method is applied in two state-of-the-art cross-view prediction methods and the representations learnt are tested in downstream tasks like classification and clustering. Results show that the ExAgt method improves representation learning compared to using only standard augmentations and it provides a better representation space stability.

### 18.Class-incremental Novel Class Discovery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08605.pdf)
>  We study the new task of class-incremental Novel Class Discovery (class-iNCD), which refers to the problem of discovering novel categories in an unlabelled data set by leveraging a pre-trained model that has been trained on a labelled data set containing disjoint yet related categories. Apart from discovering novel classes, we also aim at preserving the ability of the model to recognize previously seen base categories. Inspired by rehearsal-based incremental learning methods, in this paper we propose a novel approach for class-iNCD which prevents forgetting of past information about the base classes by jointly exploiting base class feature prototypes and feature-level knowledge distillation. We also propose a self-training clustering strategy that simultaneously clusters novel categories and trains a joint classifier for both the base and novel classes. This makes our method able to operate in a class-incremental setting. Our experiments, conducted on three common benchmarks, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

### 19.Geometry-Aware Reference Synthesis for Multi-View Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08601.pdf)
>  Recent multi-view multimedia applications struggle between high-resolution (HR) visual experience and storage or bandwidth constraints. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-View Image Super-Resolution (MVISR) task. It aims to increase the resolution of multi-view images captured from the same scene. One solution is to apply image or video super-resolution (SR) methods to reconstruct HR results from the low-resolution (LR) input view. However, these methods cannot handle large-angle transformations between views and leverage information in all multi-view images. To address these problems, we propose the MVSRnet, which uses geometry information to extract sharp details from all LR multi-view to support the SR of the LR input view. Specifically, the proposed Geometry-Aware Reference Synthesis module in MVSRnet uses geometry information and all multi-view LR images to synthesize pixel-aligned HR reference images. Then, the proposed Dynamic High-Frequency Search network fully exploits the high-frequency textural details in reference images for SR. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our method significantly improves over the state-of-the-art approaches.      
### 20.The Brain-Inspired Decoder for Natural Visual Image Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08591.pdf)
>  Decoding images from brain activity has been a challenge. Owing to the development of deep learning, there are available tools to solve this problem. The decoded image, which aims to map neural spike trains to low-level visual features and high-level semantic information space. Recently, there are a few studies of decoding from spike trains, however, these studies pay less attention to the foundations of neuroscience and there are few studies that merged receptive field into visual image reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a deep learning neural network architecture with biological properties to reconstruct visual image from spike trains. As far as we know, we implemented a method that integrated receptive field property matrix into loss function at the first time. Our model is an end-to-end decoder from neural spike trains to images. We not only merged Gabor filter into auto-encoder which used to generate images but also proposed a loss function with receptive field properties. We evaluated our decoder on two datasets which contain macaque primary visual cortex neural spikes and salamander retina ganglion cells (RGCs) spikes. Our results show that our method can effectively combine receptive field features to reconstruct images, providing a new approach to visual reconstruction based on neural information.      
### 21.Multi-manifold Attention for Vision Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08569.pdf)
>  Vision Transformer are very popular nowadays due to their state-of-the-art performance in several computer vision tasks, such as image classification and action recognition. Although the performance of Vision Transformers have been greatly improved by employing Convolutional Neural Networks, hierarchical structures and compact forms, there is limited research on ways to utilize additional data representations to refine the attention map derived from the multi-head attention of a Transformer network. This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called multi-manifold attention, that can substitute any standard attention mechanism in a Transformer-based network. The proposed attention models the input space in three distinct manifolds, namely Euclidean, Symmetric Positive Definite and Grassmann, with different statistical and geometrical properties, guiding the network to take into consideration a rich set of information that describe the appearance, color and texture of an image, for the computation of a highly descriptive attention map. In this way, a Vision Transformer with the proposed attention is guided to become more attentive towards discriminative features, leading to improved classification results, as shown by the experimental results on several well-known image classification datasets.      
### 22.Latency-Aware Collaborative Perception  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08560.pdf)
>  Collaborative perception has recently shown great potential to improve perception capabilities over single-agent perception. Existing collaborative perception methods usually consider an ideal communication environment. However, in practice, the communication system inevitably suffers from latency issues, causing potential performance degradation and high risks in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving. To mitigate the effect caused by the inevitable communication latency, from a machine learning perspective, we present the first latency-aware collaborative perception system, which actively adopts asynchronous perceptual features from multiple agents to the same timestamp, promoting the robustness and effectiveness of collaboration. To achieve such a feature-level synchronization, we propose a novel latency compensation module, calledSyncNet, which leverages feature-attention symbiotic estimation and time modulation techniques. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art collaborative perception method by 15.6% on the latest collaborative perception dataset V2X-SIM.      
### 23.Dense Cross-Query-and-Support Attention Weighted Mask Aggregation for Few-Shot Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08549.pdf)
>  Research into Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) has attracted great attention, with the goal to segment target objects in a query image given only a few annotated support images of the target class. A key to this challenging task is to fully utilize the information in the support images by exploiting fine-grained correlations between the query and support images. However, most existing approaches either compressed the support information into a few class-wise prototypes, or used partial support information (e.g., only foreground) at the pixel level, causing non-negligible information loss. In this paper, we propose Dense pixel-wise Cross-query-and-support Attention weighted Mask Aggregation (DCAMA), where both foreground and background support information are fully exploited via multi-level pixel-wise correlations between paired query and support features. Implemented with the scaled dot-product attention in the Transformer architecture, DCAMA treats every query pixel as a token, computes its similarities with all support pixels, and predicts its segmentation label as an additive aggregation of all the support pixels' labels -- weighted by the similarities. Based on the unique formulation of DCAMA, we further propose efficient and effective one-pass inference for n-shot segmentation, where pixels of all support images are collected for the mask aggregation at once. Experiments show that our DCAMA significantly advances the state of the art on standard FSS benchmarks of PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i, and FSS-1000, e.g., with 3.1%, 9.7%, and 3.6% absolute improvements in 1-shot mIoU over previous best records. Ablative studies also verify the design DCAMA.      
### 24.Few-shot Fine-grained Image Classification via Multi-Frequency Neighborhood and Double-cross Modulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08547.pdf)
>  Traditional fine-grained image classification typically relies on large-scale training samples with annotated ground-truth. However, some sub-categories may have few available samples in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot fine-grained image classification network (FicNet) using multi-frequency Neighborhood (MFN) and double-cross modulation (DCM). Module MFN is adopted to capture the information in spatial domain and frequency domain. Then, the self-similarity and multi-frequency components are extracted to produce multi-frequency structural representation. DCM employs bi-crisscross component and double 3D cross-attention components to modulate the embedding process by considering global context information and subtle relationship between categories, respectively. The comprehensive experiments on three fine-grained benchmark datasets for two few-shot tasks verify that FicNet has excellent performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Especially, the experiments on two datasets, "Caltech-UCSD Birds" and "Stanford Cars", can obtain classification accuracy 93.17\% and 95.36\%, respectively. They are even higher than that the general fine-grained image classification methods can achieve.      
### 25.UniFormer: Unified Multi-view Fusion Transformer for Spatial-Temporal Representation in Bird's-Eye-View  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08536.pdf)
>  Bird's eye view (BEV) representation is a new perception formulation for autonomous driving, which is based on spatial fusion. Further, temporal fusion is also introduced in BEV representation and gains great success. In this work, we propose a new method that unifies both spatial and temporal fusion and merges them into a unified mathematical formulation. The unified fusion could not only provide a new perspective on BEV fusion but also brings new capabilities. With the proposed unified spatial-temporal fusion, our method could support long-range fusion, which is hard to achieve in conventional BEV methods. Moreover, the BEV fusion in our work is temporal-adaptive, and the weights of temporal fusion are learnable. In contrast, conventional methods mainly use fixed and equal weights for temporal fusion. Besides, the proposed unified fusion could avoid information lost in conventional BEV fusion methods and make full use of features. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the NuScenes dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method and our method gains the state-of-the-art performance in the map segmentation task.      
### 26.DID-M3D: Decoupling Instance Depth for Monocular 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08531.pdf)
>  Monocular 3D detection has drawn much attention from the community due to its low cost and setup simplicity. It takes an RGB image as input and predicts 3D boxes in the 3D space. The most challenging sub-task lies in the instance depth estimation. Previous works usually use a direct estimation method. However, in this paper we point out that the instance depth on the RGB image is non-intuitive. It is coupled by visual depth clues and instance attribute clues, making it hard to be directly learned in the network. Therefore, we propose to reformulate the instance depth to the combination of the instance visual surface depth (visual depth) and the instance attribute depth (attribute depth). The visual depth is related to objects' appearances and positions on the image. By contrast, the attribute depth relies on objects' inherent attributes, which are invariant to the object affine transformation on the image. Correspondingly, we decouple the 3D location uncertainty into visual depth uncertainty and attribute depth uncertainty. By combining different types of depths and associated uncertainties, we can obtain the final instance depth. Furthermore, data augmentation in monocular 3D detection is usually limited due to the physical nature, hindering the boost of performance. Based on the proposed instance depth disentanglement strategy, we can alleviate this problem. Evaluated on KITTI, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results, and extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in our method.

### 27.Angular Gap: Reducing the Uncertainty of Image Difficulty through Model Calibration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08525.pdf)
>  Curriculum learning needs example difficulty to proceed from easy to hard. However, the credibility of image difficulty is rarely investigated, which can seriously affect the effectiveness of curricula. In this work, we propose Angular Gap, a measure of difficulty based on the difference in angular distance between feature embeddings and class-weight embeddings built by hyperspherical learning. To ascertain difficulty estimation, we introduce class-wise model calibration, as a post-training technique, to the learnt hyperbolic space. This bridges the gap between probabilistic model calibration and angular distance estimation of hyperspherical learning. We show the superiority of our calibrated Angular Gap over recent difficulty metrics on CIFAR10-H and ImageNetV2. We further propose Angular Gap based curriculum learning for unsupervised domain adaptation that can translate from learning easy samples to mining hard samples. We combine this curriculum with a state-of-the-art self-training method, Cycle Self Training (CST). The proposed Curricular CST learns robust representations and outperforms recent baselines on Office31 and VisDA 2017.      
### 28.HiFormer: Hierarchical Multi-scale Representations Using Transformers for Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08518.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the consensus for medical image segmentation tasks. However, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependencies and spatial correlations due to the nature of convolution operation. Although transformers were first developed to address this issue, they fail to capture low-level features. In contrast, it is demonstrated that both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction, such as segmenting in challenging contexts. In this paper, we propose HiFormer, a novel method that efficiently bridges a CNN and a transformer for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we design two multi-scale feature representations using the seminal Swin Transformer module and a CNN-based encoder. To secure a fine fusion of global and local features obtained from the two aforementioned representations, we propose a Double-Level Fusion (DLF) module in the skip connection of the encoder-decoder structure. Extensive experiments on various medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiFormer over other CNN-based, transformer-based, and hybrid methods in terms of computational complexity, and quantitative and qualitative results.

### 29.Rethinking Alignment in Video Super-Resolution Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08494.pdf)
>  The alignment of adjacent frames is considered an essential operation in video super-resolution (VSR). Advanced VSR models, including the latest VSR Transformers, are generally equipped with well-designed alignment modules. However, the progress of the self-attention mechanism may violate this common sense. In this paper, we rethink the role of alignment in VSR Transformers and make several counter-intuitive observations. Our experiments show that: (i) VSR Transformers can directly utilize multi-frame information from unaligned videos, and (ii) existing alignment methods are sometimes harmful to VSR Transformers. These observations indicate that we can further improve the performance of VSR Transformers simply by removing the alignment module and adopting a larger attention window. Nevertheless, such designs will dramatically increase the computational burden, and cannot deal with large motions. Therefore, we propose a new and efficient alignment method called patch alignment, which aligns image patches instead of pixels. VSR Transformers equipped with patch alignment could demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Our work provides valuable insights on how multi-frame information is used in VSR and how to select alignment methods for different networks/datasets.

### 30.Hierarchical Feature Alignment Network for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08485.pdf)
>  Optical flow is an easily conceived and precious cue for advancing unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS). Most of the previous methods directly extract and fuse the motion and appearance features for segmenting target objects in the UVOS setting. However, optical flow is intrinsically an instantaneous velocity of all pixels among consecutive frames, thus making the motion features not aligned well with the primary objects among the corresponding frames. To solve the above challenge, we propose a concise, practical, and efficient architecture for appearance and motion feature alignment, dubbed hierarchical feature alignment network (HFAN). Specifically, the key merits in HFAN are the sequential Feature AlignMent (FAM) module and the Feature AdaptaTion (FAT) module, which are leveraged for processing the appearance and motion features hierarchically. FAM is capable of aligning both appearance and motion features with the primary object semantic representations, respectively. Further, FAT is explicitly designed for the adaptive fusion of appearance and motion features to achieve a desirable trade-off between cross-modal features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HFAN, which reaches a new state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS-16, achieving 88.7 $\mathcal{J}\&amp;\mathcal{F}$ Mean, i.e., a relative improvement of 3.5% over the best published result.      
### 31.Multi-dimension Geospatial feature learning for urban region function recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08461.pdf)
>  Urban region function recognition plays a vital character in monitoring and managing the limited urban areas. Since urban functions are complex and full of social-economic properties, simply using remote sensing~(RS) images equipped with physical and optical information cannot completely solve the classification task. On the other hand, with the development of mobile communication and the internet, the acquisition of geospatial big data~(GBD) becomes possible. In this paper, we propose a Multi-dimension Feature Learning Model~(MDFL) using high-dimensional GBD data in conjunction with RS images for urban region function recognition. When extracting multi-dimension features, our model considers the user-related information modeled by their activity, as well as the region-based information abstracted from the region graph. Furthermore, we propose a decision fusion network that integrates the decisions from several neural networks and machine learning classifiers, and the final decision is made considering both the visual cue from the RS images and the social information from the GBD data. Through quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our model achieves overall accuracy at 92.75, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 10 percent.      
### 32.Open-world Semantic Segmentation via Contrasting and Clustering Vision-Language Embedding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08455.pdf)
>  To bridge the gap between supervised semantic segmentation and real-world applications that acquires one model to recognize arbitrary new concepts, recent zero-shot segmentation attracts a lot of attention by exploring the relationships between unseen and seen object categories, yet requiring large amounts of densely-annotated data with diverse base classes. In this paper, we propose a new open-world semantic segmentation pipeline that makes the first attempt to learn to segment semantic objects of various open-world categories without any efforts on dense annotations, by purely exploiting the image-caption data that naturally exist on the Internet. Our method, Vision-language-driven Semantic Segmentation (ViL-Seg), employs an image and a text encoder to generate visual and text embeddings for the image-caption data, with two core components that endow its segmentation ability: First, the image encoder is jointly trained with a vision-based contrasting and a cross-modal contrasting, which encourage the visual embeddings to preserve both fine-grained semantics and high-level category information that are crucial for the segmentation task. Furthermore, an online clustering head is devised over the image encoder, which allows to dynamically segment the visual embeddings into distinct semantic groups such that they can be classified by comparing with various text embeddings to complete our segmentation pipeline. Experiments show that without using any data with dense annotations, our method can directly segment objects of arbitrary categories, outperforming zero-shot segmentation methods that require data labeling on three benchmark datasets.      
### 33.Automatic universal taxonomies for multi-domain semantic segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08445.pdf)
>  Training semantic segmentation models on multiple datasets has sparked a lot of recent interest in the computer vision community. This interest has been motivated by expensive annotations and a desire to achieve proficiency across multiple visual domains. However, established datasets have mutually incompatible labels which disrupt principled inference in the wild. We address this issue by automatic construction of universal taxonomies through iterative dataset integration. Our method detects subset-superset relationships between dataset-specific labels, and supports learning of sub-class logits by treating super-classes as partial labels. We present experiments on collections of standard datasets and demonstrate competitive generalization performance with respect to previous work.      
### 34.Revisiting PatchMatch Multi-View Stereo for Urban 3D Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08439.pdf)
>  In this paper, a complete pipeline for image-based 3D reconstruction of urban scenarios is proposed, based on PatchMatch Multi-View Stereo (MVS). Input images are firstly fed into an off-the-shelf visual SLAM system to extract camera poses and sparse keypoints, which are used to initialize PatchMatch optimization. Then, pixelwise depths and normals are iteratively computed in a multi-scale framework with a novel depth-normal consistency loss term and a global refinement algorithm to balance the inherently local nature of PatchMatch. Finally, a large-scale point cloud is generated by back-projecting multi-view consistent estimates in 3D. The proposed approach is carefully evaluated against both classical MVS algorithms and monocular depth networks on the KITTI dataset, showing state of the art performances.      
### 35.Efficient View Clustering and Selection for City-Scale 3D Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08434.pdf)
>  Image datasets have been steadily growing in size, harming the feasibility and efficiency of large-scale 3D reconstruction methods. In this paper, a novel approach for scaling Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms up to arbitrarily large collections of images is proposed. Specifically, the problem of reconstructing the 3D model of an entire city is targeted, starting from a set of videos acquired by a moving vehicle equipped with several high-resolution cameras. Initially, the presented method exploits an approximately uniform distribution of poses and geometry and builds a set of overlapping clusters. Then, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem is formulated for each cluster to select an optimal subset of views that guarantees both visibility and matchability. Finally, local point clouds for each cluster are separately computed and merged. Since clustering is independent from pairwise visibility information, the proposed algorithm runs faster than existing literature and allows for a massive parallelization. Extensive testing on urban data are discussed to show the effectiveness and the scalability of this approach.      
### 36.Adaptive Assignment for Geometry Aware Local Feature Matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08427.pdf)
>  Local image feature matching, aiming to identify and correspond similar regions from image pairs, is an essential concept in computer vision. Most existing image matching approaches follow a one-to-one assignment principle and employ mutual nearest neighbor to guarantee unique correspondence between local features across images. However, images from different conditions may hold large-scale variations or viewpoint diversification so that one-to-one assignment may cause ambiguous or missing representations in dense matching. In this paper, we introduce AdaMatcher, a novel detector-free local feature matching method, which first correlates dense features by a lightweight feature interaction module and estimates co-visible area of the paired images, then performs a patch-level many-to-one assignment to predict match proposals, and finally refines them based on a one-to-one refinement module. Extensive experiments show that AdaMatcher outperforms solid baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on many downstream tasks. Additionally, the many-to-one assignment and one-to-one refinement module can be used as a refinement network for other matching methods, such as SuperGlue, to boost their performance further. Code will be available upon publication.      
### 37.Real-time End-to-End Video Text Spotter with Contrastive Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08417.pdf)
>  Video text spotting(VTS) is the task that requires simultaneously detecting, tracking and recognizing text in the video. Existing video text spotting methods typically develop sophisticated pipelines and multiple models, which is not friend for real-time applications. Here we propose a real-time end-to-end video text spotter with Contrastive Representation learning (CoText). Our contributions are three-fold: 1) CoText simultaneously address the three tasks (e.g., text detection, tracking, recognition) in a real-time end-to-end trainable framework. 2) With contrastive learning, CoText models long-range dependencies and learning temporal information across multiple frames. 3) A simple, lightweight architecture is designed for effective and accurate performance, including GPU-parallel detection post-processing, CTC-based recognition head with Masked RoI. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method. Especially, CoText achieves an video text spotting IDF1 of 72.0% at 41.0 FPS on ICDAR2015video, with 10.5% and 32.0 FPS improvement the previous best method.

### 38.TokenMix: Rethinking Image Mixing for Data Augmentation in Vision Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08409.pdf)
>  CutMix is a popular augmentation technique commonly used for training modern convolutional and transformer vision networks. It was originally designed to encourage Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to focus more on an image's global context instead of local information, which greatly improves the performance of CNNs. However, we found it to have limited benefits for transformer-based architectures that naturally have a global receptive field. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique TokenMix to improve the performance of vision transformers. TokenMix mixes two images at token level via partitioning the mixing region into multiple separated parts. Besides, we show that the mixed learning target in CutMix, a linear combination of a pair of the ground truth labels, might be inaccurate and sometimes counter-intuitive. To obtain a more suitable target, we propose to assign the target score according to the content-based neural activation maps of the two images from a pre-trained teacher model, which does not need to have high performance. With plenty of experiments on various vision transformer architectures, we show that our proposed TokenMix helps vision transformers focus on the foreground area to infer the classes and enhances their robustness to occlusion, with consistent performance gains. Notably, we improve DeiT-T/S/B with +1% ImageNet top-1 accuracy. Besides, TokenMix enjoys longer training, which achieves 81.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with DeiT-S trained for 400 epochs.

### 39.MPIB: An MPI-Based Bokeh Rendering Framework for Realistic Partial Occlusion Effects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08403.pdf)
>  Partial occlusion effects are a phenomenon that blurry objects near a camera are semi-transparent, resulting in partial appearance of occluded background. However, it is challenging for existing bokeh rendering methods to simulate realistic partial occlusion effects due to the missing information of the occluded area in an all-in-focus image. Inspired by the learnable 3D scene representation, Multiplane Image (MPI), we attempt to address the partial occlusion by introducing a novel MPI-based high-resolution bokeh rendering framework, termed MPIB. To this end, we first present an analysis on how to apply the MPI representation to bokeh rendering. Based on this analysis, we propose an MPI representation module combined with a background inpainting module to implement high-resolution scene representation. This representation can then be reused to render various bokeh effects according to the controlling parameters. To train and test our model, we also design a ray-tracing-based bokeh generator for data generation. Extensive experiments on synthesized and real-world images validate the effectiveness and flexibility of this framework.      
### 40.A Semantic-aware Attention and Visual Shielding Network for Cloth-changing Person Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08387.pdf)
>  Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches, but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module (HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly, these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.      
### 41.Entity-enhanced Adaptive Reconstruction Network for Weakly Supervised Referring Expression Grounding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08386.pdf)
>  Weakly supervised Referring Expression Grounding (REG) aims to ground a particular target in an image described by a language expression while lacking the correspondence between target and expression. Two main problems exist in weakly supervised REG. First, the lack of region-level annotations introduces ambiguities between proposals and queries. Second, most previous weakly supervised REG methods ignore the discriminative location and context of the referent, causing difficulties in distinguishing the target from other same-category objects. To address the above challenges, we design an entity-enhanced adaptive reconstruction network (EARN). Specifically, EARN includes three modules: entity enhancement, adaptive grounding, and collaborative reconstruction. In entity enhancement, we calculate semantic similarity as supervision to select the candidate proposals. Adaptive grounding calculates the ranking score of candidate proposals upon subject, location and context with hierarchical attention. Collaborative reconstruction measures the ranking result from three perspectives: adaptive reconstruction, language reconstruction and attribute classification. The adaptive mechanism helps to alleviate the variance of different referring expressions. Experiments on five datasets show EARN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed EARN can better handle the situation where multiple objects of a particular category are situated together.      
### 42.Visual Representations of Physiological Signals for Fake Video Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08380.pdf)
>  Realistic fake videos are a potential tool for spreading harmful misinformation given our increasing online presence and information intake. This paper presents a multimodal learning-based method for detection of real and fake videos. The method combines information from three modalities - audio, video, and physiology. We investigate two strategies for combining the video and physiology modalities, either by augmenting the video with information from the physiology or by novelly learning the fusion of those two modalities with a proposed Graph Convolutional Network architecture. Both strategies for combining the two modalities rely on a novel method for generation of visual representations of physiological signals. The detection of real and fake videos is then based on the dissimilarity between the audio and modified video modalities. The proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets and the results show significant increase in detection performance compared to previous methods.      
### 43.Adversarial Contrastive Learning via Asymmetric InfoNCE  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08374.pdf)
>  Contrastive learning (CL) has recently been applied to adversarial learning tasks. Such practice considers adversarial samples as additional positive views of an instance, and by maximizing their agreements with each other, yields better adversarial robustness. However, this mechanism can be potentially flawed, since adversarial perturbations may cause instance-level identity confusion, which can impede CL performance by pulling together different instances with separate identities. To address this issue, we propose to treat adversarial samples unequally when contrasted, with an asymmetric InfoNCE objective ($A-InfoNCE$) that allows discriminating considerations of adversarial samples. Specifically, adversaries are viewed as inferior positives that induce weaker learning signals, or as hard negatives exhibiting higher contrast to other negative samples. In the asymmetric fashion, the adverse impacts of conflicting objectives between CL and adversarial learning can be effectively mitigated. Experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms existing Adversarial CL methods across different finetuning schemes without additional computational cost. The proposed A-InfoNCE is also a generic form that can be readily extended to other CL methods.

### 44.Learning Knowledge Representation with Meta Knowledge Distillation for Single Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08356.pdf)
>  Knowledge distillation (KD), which can efficiently transfer knowledge from a cumbersome network (teacher) to a compact network (student), has demonstrated its advantages in some computer vision applications. The representation of knowledge is vital for knowledge transferring and student learning, which is generally defined in hand-crafted manners or uses the intermediate features directly. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic meta knowledge distillation method under the teacher-student architecture for the single image super-resolution task. It provides a more flexible and accurate way to help the teachers transmit knowledge in accordance with the abilities of students via knowledge representation networks (KRNets) with learnable parameters. In order to improve the perception ability of knowledge representation to students' requirements, we propose to solve the transformation process from intermediate outputs to transferred knowledge by employing the student features and the correlation between teacher and student in the KRNets. Specifically, the texture-aware dynamic kernels are generated and then extract texture features to be improved and the corresponding teacher guidance so as to decompose the distillation problem into texture-wise supervision for further promoting the recovery quality of high-frequency details. In addition, the KRNets are optimized in a meta-learning manner to ensure the knowledge transferring and the student learning are beneficial to improving the reconstructed quality of the student. Experiments conducted on various single image super-resolution datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing defined knowledge representation related distillation methods, and can help super-resolution algorithms achieve better reconstruction quality without introducing any inference complexity.      
### 45.Show Me What I Like: Detecting User-Specific Video Highlights Using Content-Based Multi-Head Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08352.pdf)
>  We propose a method to detect individualized highlights for users on given target videos based on their preferred highlight clips marked on previous videos they have watched. Our method explicitly leverages the contents of both the preferred clips and the target videos using pre-trained features for the objects and the human activities. We design a multi-head attention mechanism to adaptively weigh the preferred clips based on their object- and human-activity-based contents, and fuse them using these weights into a single feature representation for each user. We compute similarities between these per-user feature representations and the per-frame features computed from the desired target videos to estimate the user-specific highlight clips from the target videos. We test our method on a large-scale highlight detection dataset containing the annotated highlights of individual users. Compared to current baselines, we observe an absolute improvement of 2-4% in the mean average precision of the detected highlights. We also perform extensive ablation experiments on the number of preferred highlight clips associated with each user as well as on the object- and human-activity-based feature representations to validate that our method is indeed both content-based and user-specific.      
### 46.SepLUT: Separable Image-adaptive Lookup Tables for Real-time Image Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08351.pdf)
>  Image-adaptive lookup tables (LUTs) have achieved great success in real-time image enhancement tasks due to their high efficiency for modeling color transforms. However, they embed the complete transform, including the color component-independent and the component-correlated parts, into only a single type of LUTs, either 1D or 3D, in a coupled manner. This scheme raises a dilemma of improving model expressiveness or efficiency due to two factors. On the one hand, the 1D LUTs provide high computational efficiency but lack the critical capability of color components interaction. On the other, the 3D LUTs present enhanced component-correlated transform capability but suffer from heavy memory footprint, high training difficulty, and limited cell utilization. Inspired by the conventional divide-and-conquer practice in the image signal processor, we present SepLUT (separable image-adaptive lookup table) to tackle the above limitations. Specifically, we separate a single color transform into a cascade of component-independent and component-correlated sub-transforms instantiated as 1D and 3D LUTs, respectively. In this way, the capabilities of two sub-transforms can facilitate each other, where the 3D LUT complements the ability to mix up color components, and the 1D LUT redistributes the input colors to increase the cell utilization of the 3D LUT and thus enable the use of a more lightweight 3D LUT. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method presents enhanced performance on photo retouching benchmark datasets than the current state-of-the-art and achieves real-time processing on both GPUs and CPUs.      
### 47.MobileCodec: Neural Inter-frame Video Compression on Mobile Devices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08338.pdf)
>  Realizing the potential of neural video codecs on mobile devices is a big technological challenge due to the computational complexity of deep networks and the power-constrained mobile hardware. We demonstrate practical feasibility by leveraging Qualcomm's technology and innovation, bridging the gap from neural network-based codec simulations running on wall-powered workstations, to real-time operation on a mobile device powered by Snapdragon technology. We show the first-ever inter-frame neural video decoder running on a commercial mobile phone, decoding high-definition videos in real-time while maintaining a low bitrate and high visual quality.      
### 48.Towards the Human Global Context: Does the Vision-Language Model Really Judge Like a Human Being?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08333.pdf)
>  As computer vision and NLP make progress, Vision-Language(VL) is becoming an important area of research. Despite the importance, evaluation metrics of the research domain is still at a preliminary stage of development. In this paper, we propose a quantitative metric "Equivariance Score" and evaluation dataset "Human Puzzle" to assess whether a VL model is understanding an image like a human. We observed that the VL model does not interpret the overall context of an input image but instead shows biases toward a specific object or shape that forms the local context. We aim to quantitatively measure a model's performance in understanding context. To verify the current existing VL model's capability, we sliced the original input image into pieces and randomly placed them, distorting the global context of the image. Our paper discusses each VL model's level of interpretation on global context and addresses how the structural characteristics influenced the results.      
### 49.Defect Transformer: An Efficient Hybrid Transformer Architecture for Surface Defect Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08319.pdf)
>  Surface defect detection is an extremely crucial step to ensure the quality of industrial products. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on encoder-decoder architecture have achieved tremendous success in various defect detection tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution, they commonly exhibit a limitation in explicitly modeling long-range interactions, critical for pixel-wise defect detection in complex cases, e.g., cluttered background and illegible pseudo-defects. Recent transformers are especially skilled at learning global image dependencies but with limited local structural information necessary for detailed defect location. To overcome the above limitations, we propose an efficient hybrid transformer architecture, termed Defect Transformer (DefT), for surface defect detection, which incorporates CNN and transformer into a unified model to capture local and non-local relationships collaboratively. Specifically, in the encoder module, a convolutional stem block is firstly adopted to retain more detailed spatial information. Then, the patch aggregation blocks are used to generate multi-scale representation with four hierarchies, each of them is followed by a series of DefT blocks, which respectively include a locally position-aware block for local position encoding, a lightweight multi-pooling self-attention to model multi-scale global contextual relationships with good computational efficiency, and a convolutional feed-forward network for feature transformation and further location information learning. Finally, a simple but effective decoder module is proposed to gradually recover spatial details from the skip connections in the encoder. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our method compared with other CNN- and transformer-based networks.      
### 50.Gigapixel Whole-Slide Images Classification using Locally Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08267.pdf)
>  Histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) play a very important role in clinical studies and serve as the gold standard for many cancer diagnoses. However, generating automatic tools for processing WSIs is challenging due to their enormous sizes. Currently, to deal with this issue, conventional methods rely on a multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy to process a WSI at patch level. Although effective, such methods are computationally expensive, because tiling a WSI into patches takes time and does not explore the spatial relations between these tiles. To tackle these limitations, we propose a locally supervised learning framework which processes the entire slide by exploring the entire local and global information that it contains. This framework divides a pre-trained network into several modules and optimizes each module locally using an auxiliary model. We also introduce a random feature reconstruction unit (RFR) to preserve distinguishing features during training and improve the performance of our method by 1% to 3%. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and LKS, highlight the superiority of our method on different classification tasks. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL methods by 2% to 5% in accuracy, while being 7 to 10 times faster. Additionally, when dividing it into eight modules, our method requires as little as 20% of the total gpu memory required by end-to-end training.

### 51.Learning with Recoverable Forgetting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08224.pdf)
>  Life-long learning aims at learning a sequence of tasks without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. However, the involved training data may not be life-long legitimate due to privacy or copyright reasons. In practical scenarios, for instance, the model owner may wish to enable or disable the knowledge of specific tasks or specific samples from time to time. Such flexible control over knowledge transfer, unfortunately, has been largely overlooked in previous incremental or decremental learning methods, even at a problem-setup level. In this paper, we explore a novel learning scheme, termed as Learning wIth Recoverable Forgetting (LIRF), that explicitly handles the task- or sample-specific knowledge removal and recovery. Specifically, LIRF brings in two innovative schemes, namely knowledge deposit and withdrawal, which allow for isolating user-designated knowledge from a pre-trained network and injecting it back when necessary. During the knowledge deposit process, the specified knowledge is extracted from the target network and stored in a deposit module, while the insensitive or general knowledge of the target network is preserved and further augmented. During knowledge withdrawal, the taken-off knowledge is added back to the target network. The deposit and withdraw processes only demand for a few epochs of finetuning on the removal data, ensuring both data and time efficiency. We conduct experiments on several datasets, and demonstrate that the proposed LIRF strategy yields encouraging results with gratifying generalization capability.      
### 52.Fast-MoCo: Boost Momentum-based Contrastive Learning with Combinatorial Patches  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08220.pdf)
>  Contrastive-based self-supervised learning methods achieved great success in recent years. However, self-supervision requires extremely long training epochs (e.g., 800 epochs for MoCo v3) to achieve promising results, which is unacceptable for the general academic community and hinders the development of this topic. This work revisits the momentum-based contrastive learning frameworks and identifies the inefficiency in which two augmented views generate only one positive pair. We propose Fast-MoCo - a novel framework that utilizes combinatorial patches to construct multiple positive pairs from two augmented views, which provides abundant supervision signals that bring significant acceleration with neglectable extra computational cost. Fast-MoCo trained with 100 epochs achieves 73.5% linear evaluation accuracy, similar to MoCo v3 (ResNet-50 backbone) trained with 800 epochs. Extra training (200 epochs) further improves the result to 75.1%, which is on par with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on several downstream tasks also confirm the effectiveness of Fast-MoCo.      
### 53.A Simple Test-Time Method for Out-of-Distribution Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08210.pdf)
>  Neural networks are known to produce over-confident predictions on input images, even when these images are out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This limits the applications of neural network models in real-world scenarios, where OOD samples exist. Many existing approaches identify the OOD instances via exploiting various cues, such as finding irregular patterns in the feature space, logits space, gradient space or the raw space of images. In contrast, this paper proposes a simple Test-time Linear Training (ETLT) method for OOD detection. Empirically, we find that the probabilities of input images being out-of-distribution are surprisingly linearly correlated to the features extracted by neural networks. To be specific, many state-of-the-art OOD algorithms, although designed to measure reliability in different ways, actually lead to OOD scores mostly linearly related to their image features. Thus, by simply learning a linear regression model trained from the paired image features and inferred OOD scores at test-time, we can make a more precise OOD prediction for the test instances. We further propose an online variant of the proposed method, which achieves promising performance and is more practical in real-world applications. Remarkably, we improve FPR95 from $51.37\%$ to $12.30\%$ on CIFAR-10 datasets with maximum softmax probability as the base OOD detector. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the efficacy of ETLT for OOD detection task.      
### 54.INFWIDE: Image and Feature Space Wiener Deconvolution Network for Non-blind Image Deblurring in Low-Light Conditions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08201.pdf)
>  Under low-light environment, handheld photography suffers from severe camera shake under long exposure settings. Although existing deblurring algorithms have shown promising performance on well-exposed blurry images, they still cannot cope with low-light snapshots. Sophisticated noise and saturation regions are two dominating challenges in practical low-light deblurring. In this work, we propose a novel non-blind deblurring method dubbed image and feature space Wiener deconvolution network (INFWIDE) to tackle these problems systematically. In terms of algorithm design, INFWIDE proposes a two-branch architecture, which explicitly removes noise and hallucinates saturated regions in the image space and suppresses ringing artifacts in the feature space, and integrates the two complementary outputs with a subtle multi-scale fusion network for high quality night photograph deblurring. For effective network training, we design a set of loss functions integrating a forward imaging model and backward reconstruction to form a close-loop regularization to secure good convergence of the deep neural network. Further, to optimize INFWIDE's applicability in real low-light conditions, a physical-process-based low-light noise model is employed to synthesize realistic noisy night photographs for model training. Taking advantage of the traditional Wiener deconvolution algorithm's physically driven characteristics and arisen deep neural network's representation ability, INFWIDE can recover fine details while suppressing the unpleasant artifacts during deblurring. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.      
### 55.Stroke-Based Autoencoders: Self-Supervised Learners for Efficient Zero-Shot Chinese Character Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08191.pdf)
>  Chinese characters carry a wealth of morphological and semantic information; therefore, the semantic enhancement of the morphology of Chinese characters has drawn significant attention. The previous methods were intended to directly extract information from a whole Chinese character image, which usually cannot capture both global and local information simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a stroke-based autoencoder(SAE), to model the sophisticated morphology of Chinese characters with the self-supervised method. Following its canonical writing order, we first represent a Chinese character as a series of stroke images with a fixed writing order, and then our SAE model is trained to reconstruct this stroke image sequence. This pre-trained SAE model can predict the stroke image series for unseen characters, as long as their strokes or radicals appeared in the training set. We have designed two contrasting SAE architectures on different forms of stroke images. One is fine-tuned on existing stroke-based method for zero-shot recognition of handwritten Chinese characters, and the other is applied to enrich the Chinese word embeddings from their morphological features. The experimental results validate that after pre-training, our SAE architecture outperforms other existing methods in zero-shot recognition and enhances the representation of Chinese characters with their abundant morphological and semantic information.      
### 56.Mind the Gap: Polishing Pseudo labels for Accurate Semi-supervised Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08185.pdf)
>  Exploiting pseudo labels (e.g., categories and bounding boxes) of unannotated objects produced by a teacher detector have underpinned much of recent progress in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, due to the limited generalization capacity of the teacher detector caused by the scarce annotations, the produced pseudo labels often deviate from ground truth, especially those with relatively low classification confidences, thus limiting the generalization performance of SSOD. To mitigate this problem, we propose a dual pseudo-label polishing framework for SSOD. Instead of directly exploiting the pseudo labels produced by the teacher detector, we take the first attempt at reducing their deviation from ground truth using dual polishing learning, where two differently structured polishing networks are elaborately developed and trained using synthesized paired pseudo labels and the corresponding ground truth for categories and bounding boxes on the given annotated objects, respectively. By doing this, both polishing networks can infer more accurate pseudo labels for unannotated objects through sufficiently exploiting their context knowledge based on the initially produced pseudo labels, and thus improve the generalization performance of SSOD. Moreover, such a scheme can be seamlessly plugged into the existing SSOD framework for joint end-to-end learning. In addition, we propose to disentangle the polished pseudo categories and bounding boxes of unannotated objects for separate category classification and bounding box regression in SSOD, which enables introducing more unannotated objects during model training and thus further improve the performance. Experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art baselines.      
### 57.Zero-Shot Temporal Action Detection via Vision-Language Prompting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08184.pdf)
>  Existing temporal action detection (TAD) methods rely on large training data including segment-level annotations, limited to recognizing previously seen classes alone during inference. Collecting and annotating a large training set for each class of interest is costly and hence unscalable. Zero-shot TAD (ZS-TAD) resolves this obstacle by enabling a pre-trained model to recognize any unseen action classes. Meanwhile, ZS-TAD is also much more challenging with significantly less investigation. Inspired by the success of zero-shot image classification aided by vision-language (ViL) models such as CLIP, we aim to tackle the more complex TAD task. An intuitive method is to integrate an off-the-shelf proposal detector with CLIP style classification. However, due to the sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification design, it is prone to localization error propagation. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a novel zero-Shot Temporal Action detection model via Vision-LanguagE prompting (STALE). Such a novel design effectively eliminates the dependence between localization and classification by breaking the route for error propagation in-between. We further introduce an interaction mechanism between classification and localization for improved optimization. Extensive experiments on standard ZS-TAD video benchmarks show that our STALE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives. Besides, our model also yields superior results on supervised TAD over recent strong competitors. The PyTorch implementation of STALE is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/sauradip/STALE" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 58.Watermark Vaccine: Adversarial Attacks to Prevent Watermark Removal  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08178.pdf)
>  As a common security tool, visible watermarking has been widely applied to protect copyrights of digital images. However, recent works have shown that visible watermarks can be removed by DNNs without damaging their host images. Such watermark-removal techniques pose a great threat to the ownership of images. Inspired by the vulnerability of DNNs on adversarial perturbations, we propose a novel defence mechanism by adversarial machine learning for good. From the perspective of the adversary, blind watermark-removal networks can be posed as our target models; then we actually optimize an imperceptible adversarial perturbation on the host images to proactively attack against watermark-removal networks, dubbed Watermark Vaccine. Specifically, two types of vaccines are proposed. Disrupting Watermark Vaccine (DWV) induces to ruin the host image along with watermark after passing through watermark-removal networks. In contrast, Inerasable Watermark Vaccine (IWV) works in another fashion of trying to keep the watermark not removed and still noticeable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our DWV/IWV in preventing watermark removal, especially on various watermark removal networks.      
### 59.Action-conditioned On-demand Motion Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08164.pdf)
>  We propose a novel framework, On-Demand MOtion Generation (ODMO), for generating realistic and diverse long-term 3D human motion sequences conditioned only on action types with an additional capability of customization. ODMO shows improvements over SOTA approaches on all traditional motion evaluation metrics when evaluated on three public datasets (HumanAct12, UESTC, and MoCap). Furthermore, we provide both qualitative evaluations and quantitative metrics demonstrating several first-known customization capabilities afforded by our framework, including mode discovery, interpolation, and trajectory customization. These capabilities significantly widen the spectrum of potential applications of such motion generation models. The novel on-demand generative capabilities are enabled by innovations in both the encoder and decoder architectures: (i) Encoder: Utilizing contrastive learning in low-dimensional latent space to create a hierarchical embedding of motion sequences, where not only the codes of different action types form different groups, but within an action type, codes of similar inherent patterns (motion styles) cluster together, making them readily discoverable; (ii) Decoder: Using a hierarchical decoding strategy where the motion trajectory is reconstructed first and then used to reconstruct the whole motion sequence. Such an architecture enables effective trajectory control.

### 60.FashionViL: Fashion-Focused Vision-and-Language Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08150.pdf)
>  Large-scale Vision-and-Language (V+L) pre-training for representation learning has proven to be effective in boosting various downstream V+L tasks. However, when it comes to the fashion domain, existing V+L methods are inadequate as they overlook the unique characteristics of both the fashion V+L data and downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel fashion-focused V+L representation learning framework, dubbed as FashionViL. It contains two novel fashion-specific pre-training tasks designed particularly to exploit two intrinsic attributes with fashion V+L data. First, in contrast to other domains where a V+L data point contains only a single image-text pair, there could be multiple images in the fashion domain. We thus propose a Multi-View Contrastive Learning task for pulling closer the visual representation of one image to the compositional multimodal representation of another image+text. Second, fashion text (e.g., product description) often contains rich fine-grained concepts (attributes/noun phrases). To exploit this, a Pseudo-Attributes Classification task is introduced to encourage the learned unimodal (visual/textual) representations of the same concept to be adjacent. Further, fashion V+L tasks uniquely include ones that do not conform to the common one-stream or two-stream architectures (e.g., text-guided image retrieval). We thus propose a flexible, versatile V+L model architecture consisting of a modality-agnostic Transformer so that it can be flexibly adapted to any downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that our FashionViL achieves a new state of the art across five downstream tasks.

### 61.2D Self-Organized ONN Model For Handwritten Text Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08139.pdf)
>  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently reached state-of-the-art Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) performance. However, recent research has shown that typical CNNs' learning performance is limited since they are homogeneous networks with a simple (linear) neuron model. With their heterogeneous network structure incorporating non-linear neurons, Operational Neural Networks (ONNs) have recently been proposed to address this drawback. Self-ONNs are self-organized variations of ONNs with the generative neuron model that can generate any non-linear function using the Taylor approximation. In this study, in order to improve the state-of-the-art performance level in HTR, the 2D Self-organized ONNs (Self-ONNs) in the core of a novel network model are proposed. Moreover, deformable convolutions, which have recently been demonstrated to tackle variations in the writing styles better, are utilized in this study. The results over the IAM English dataset and HADARA80P Arabic dataset show that the proposed model with the operational layers of Self-ONNs significantly improves Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER). Compared with its counterpart CNNs, Self-ONNs reduce CER and WER by 1.2% and 3.4 % in the HADARA80P and 0.199% and 1.244% in the IAM dataset. The results over the benchmark IAM demonstrate that the proposed model with the operational layers of Self-ONNs outperforms recent deep CNN models by a significant margin while the use of Self-ONNs with deformable convolutions demonstrates exceptional results.      
### 62.Editing Out-of-domain GAN Inversion via Differential Activations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08134.pdf)
>  Despite the demonstrated editing capacity in the latent space of a pretrained GAN model, inverting real-world images is stuck in a dilemma that the reconstruction cannot be faithful to the original input. The main reason for this is that the distributions between training and real-world data are misaligned, and because of that, it is unstable of GAN inversion for real image editing. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN prior based editing framework to tackle the out-of-domain inversion problem with a composition-decomposition paradigm. In particular, during the phase of composition, we introduce a differential activation module for detecting semantic changes from a global perspective, \ie, the relative gap between the features of edited and unedited images. With the aid of the generated Diff-CAM mask, a coarse reconstruction can intuitively be composited by the paired original and edited images. In this way, the attribute-irrelevant regions can be survived in almost whole, while the quality of such an intermediate result is still limited by an unavoidable ghosting effect. Consequently, in the decomposition phase, we further present a GAN prior based deghosting network for separating the final fine edited image from the coarse reconstruction. Extensive experiments exhibit superiorities over the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The robustness and flexibility of our method is also validated on both scenarios of single attribute and multi-attribute manipulations.      
### 63.E-NeRV: Expedite Neural Video Representation with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal Context  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08132.pdf)
>  Recently, the image-wise implicit neural representation of videos, NeRV, has gained popularity for its promising results and swift speed compared to regular pixel-wise implicit representations. However, the redundant parameters within the network structure can cause a large model size when scaling up for desirable performance. The key reason of this phenomenon is the coupled formulation of NeRV, which outputs the spatial and temporal information of video frames directly from the frame index input. In this paper, we propose E-NeRV, which dramatically expedites NeRV by decomposing the image-wise implicit neural representation into separate spatial and temporal context. Under the guidance of this new formulation, our model greatly reduces the redundant model parameters, while retaining the representation ability. We experimentally find that our method can improve the performance to a large extent with fewer parameters, resulting in a more than $8\times$ faster speed on convergence.

### 64.Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Blind Image Quality Assessment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08124.pdf)
>  Existing learning-based methods for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) are heavily dependent on large amounts of annotated training data, and usually suffer from a severe performance degradation when encountering the domain/distribution shift problem. Thanks to the development of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), some works attempt to transfer the knowledge from a label-sufficient source domain to a label-free target domain under domain shift with UDA. However, it requires the coexistence of source and target data, which might be impractical for source data due to the privacy or storage issues. In this paper, we take the first step towards the source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) in a simple yet efficient manner for BIQA to tackle the domain shift without access to the source data. Specifically, we cast the quality assessment task as a rating distribution prediction problem. Based on the intrinsic properties of BIQA, we present a group of well-designed self-supervised objectives to guide the adaptation of the BN affine parameters towards the target domain. Among them, minimizing the prediction entropy and maximizing the batch prediction diversity aim to encourage more confident results while avoiding the trivial solution. Besides, based on the observation that the IQA rating distribution of single image follows the Gaussian distribution, we apply Gaussian regularization to the predicted rating distribution to make it more consistent with the nature of human scoring. Extensive experimental results under cross-domain scenarios demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method to mitigate the domain shift.      
### 65.Learning from Temporal Spatial Cubism for Cross-Dataset Skeleton-based Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08095.pdf)
>  Rapid progress and superior performance have been achieved for skeleton-based action recognition recently. In this article, we investigate this problem under a cross-dataset setting, which is a new, pragmatic, and challenging task in real-world scenarios. Following the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) paradigm, the action labels are only available on a source dataset, but unavailable on a target dataset in the training stage. Different from the conventional adversarial learning-based approaches for UDA, we utilize a self-supervision scheme to reduce the domain shift between two skeleton-based action datasets. Our inspiration is drawn from Cubism, an art genre from the early 20th century, which breaks and reassembles the objects to convey a greater context. By segmenting and permuting temporal segments or human body parts, we design two self-supervised learning classification tasks to explore the temporal and spatial dependency of a skeleton-based action and improve the generalization ability of the model. We conduct experiments on six datasets for skeleton-based action recognition, including three large-scale datasets (NTU RGB+D, PKU-MMD, and Kinetics) where new cross-dataset settings and benchmarks are established. Extensive results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

### 66.Threat Model-Agnostic Adversarial Defense using Diffusion Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08089.pdf)
>  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly sensitive to imperceptible malicious perturbations, known as adversarial attacks. Following the discovery of this vulnerability in real-world imaging and vision applications, the associated safety concerns have attracted vast research attention, and many defense techniques have been developed. Most of these defense methods rely on adversarial training (AT) -- training the classification network on images perturbed according to a specific threat model, which defines the magnitude of the allowed modification. Although AT leads to promising results, training on a specific threat model fails to generalize to other types of perturbations. A different approach utilizes a preprocessing step to remove the adversarial perturbation from the attacked image. In this work, we follow the latter path and aim to develop a technique that leads to robust classifiers across various realizations of threat models. To this end, we harness the recent advances in stochastic generative modeling, and means to leverage these for sampling from conditional distributions. Our defense relies on an addition of Gaussian i.i.d noise to the attacked image, followed by a pretrained diffusion process -- an architecture that performs a stochastic iterative process over a denoising network, yielding a high perceptual quality denoised outcome. The obtained robustness with this stochastic preprocessing step is validated through extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing that our method outperforms the leading defense methods under various threat models.      
### 67.CATRE: Iterative Point Clouds Alignment for Category-level Object Pose Refinement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08082.pdf)
>  While category-level 9DoF object pose estimation has emerged recently, previous correspondence-based or direct regression methods are both limited in accuracy due to the huge intra-category variances in object shape and color, etc. Orthogonal to them, this work presents a category-level object pose and size refiner CATRE, which is able to iteratively enhance pose estimate from point clouds to produce accurate results. Given an initial pose estimate, CATRE predicts a relative transformation between the initial pose and ground truth by means of aligning the partially observed point cloud and an abstract shape prior. In specific, we propose a novel disentangled architecture being aware of the inherent distinctions between rotation and translation/size estimation. Extensive experiments show that our approach remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods on REAL275, CAMERA25, and LM benchmarks up to a speed of ~85.32Hz, and achieves competitive results on category-level tracking. We further demonstrate that CATRE can perform pose refinement on unseen category. Code and trained models are available.      
### 68.Neural Color Operators for Sequential Image Retouching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08080.pdf)
>  We propose a novel image retouching method by modeling the retouching process as performing a sequence of newly introduced trainable neural color operators. The neural color operator mimics the behavior of traditional color operators and learns pixelwise color transformation while its strength is controlled by a scalar. To reflect the homomorphism property of color operators, we employ equivariant mapping and adopt an encoder-decoder structure which maps the non-linear color transformation to a much simpler transformation (i.e., translation) in a high dimensional space. The scalar strength of each neural color operator is predicted using CNN based strength predictors by analyzing global image statistics. Overall, our method is rather lightweight and offers flexible controls. Experiments and user studies on public datasets show that our method consistently achieves the best results compared with SOTA methods in both quantitative measures and visual qualities. The code and data will be made publicly available.      
### 69.Performance degradation of ImageNet trained models by simple image transformations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08079.pdf)
>  ImageNet trained PyTorch models are generally preferred as the off-the-shelf models for direct use or for initialisation in most computer vision tasks. In this paper, we simply test a representative set of these convolution and transformer based models under many simple image transformations like horizontal shifting, vertical shifting, scaling, rotation, presence of Gaussian noise, cutout, horizontal flip and vertical flip and report the performance drop caused by such transformations. We find that even simple transformations like rotating the image by 10° or zooming in by 20% can reduce the top-1 accuracy of models like ResNet152 by 1%+.

### 70.Effect of Instance Normalization on Fine-Grained Control for Sketch-Based Face Image Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08072.pdf)
>  Sketching is an intuitive and effective way for content creation. While significant progress has been made for photorealistic image generation by using generative adversarial networks, it remains challenging to take a fine-grained control on synthetic content. The instance normalization layer, which is widely adopted in existing image translation networks, washes away details in the input sketch and leads to loss of precise control on the desired shape of the generated face images. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the effect of instance normalization on generating photorealistic face images from hand-drawn sketches. We first introduce a visualization approach to analyze the feature embedding for sketches with a group of specific changes. Based on the visual analysis, we modify the instance normalization layers in the baseline image translation model. We elaborate a new set of hand-drawn sketches with 11 categories of specially designed changes and conduct extensive experimental analysis. The results and user studies demonstrate that our method markedly improve the quality of synthesized images and the conformance with user intention.      
### 71.Detecting Humans in RGB-D Data with CNNs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08064.pdf)
>  We address the problem of people detection in RGB-D data where we leverage depth information to develop a region-of-interest (ROI) selection method that provides proposals to two color and depth CNNs. To combine the detections produced by the two CNNs, we propose a novel fusion approach based on the characteristics of depth images. We also present a new depth-encoding scheme, which not only encodes depth images into three channels but also enhances the information for classification. We conduct experiments on a publicly available RGB-D people dataset and show that our approach outperforms the baseline models that only use RGB data.      
### 72.SatMAE: Pre-training Transformers for Temporal and Multi-Spectral Satellite Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08051.pdf)
>  Unsupervised pre-training methods for large vision models have shown to enhance performance on downstream supervised tasks. Developing similar techniques for satellite imagery presents significant opportunities as unlabelled data is plentiful and the inherent temporal and multi-spectral structure provides avenues to further improve existing pre-training strategies. In this paper, we present SatMAE, a pre-training framework for temporal or multi-spectral satellite imagery based on Masked Autoencoder (MAE). To leverage temporal information, we include a temporal embedding along with independently masking image patches across time. In addition, we demonstrate that encoding multi-spectral data as groups of bands with distinct spectral positional encodings is beneficial. Our approach yields strong improvements over previous state-of-the-art techniques, both in terms of supervised learning performance on benchmark datasets (up to $\uparrow$ 7\%), and transfer learning performance on downstream remote sensing tasks, including land cover classification (up to $\uparrow$ 14\%) and semantic segmentation.      
### 73.MDM:Visual Explanations for Neural Networks via Multiple Dynamic Mask  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08046.pdf)
>  The active region lookup of a neural network tells us which regions the neural network focuses on when making a decision, which gives us a basis for interpretability when the neural network makes a classification decision. We propose an algorithm Multiple Dynamic Mask(MDM), which is a general saliency graph query method with interpretability of the inference process. Its proposal is based on an assumption: when a picture is input to a neural network that has been trained, the activation features related to classification will affect the classification results of the neural network, and the features unrelated to classification will hardly affect the classification results of the network. MDM: A learning-based end-to-end algorithm for finding regions of interest for neural network classification. It has the following advantages: 1. It has the interpretability of the reasoning process. 2. It is universal, it can be used for any neural network and does not depend on the internal structure of the neural network. 3. The search performance is better. Because the algorithm is based on learning to generate masks and has the ability to adapt to different data and networks, the performance is better than the method proposed in the previous paper. For the MDM saliency map search algorithm, we experimentally compared the performance indicators of various saliency map search methods and the MDM with ResNet and DenseNet as the trained neural networks. The search effect performance of the MDM reached the state of the art. We applied the MDM to the interpretable neural network ProtoPNet and XProtoNet, which improved the interpretability of the model and the prototype search performance. We visualize the performance of convolutional neural architecture and Transformer architecture on saliency map search.      
### 74.DIMBA: Discretely Masked Black-Box Attack in Single Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08044.pdf)
>  The adversarial attack can force a CNN-based model to produce an incorrect output by craftily manipulating human-imperceptible input. Exploring such perturbations can help us gain a deeper understanding of the vulnerability of neural networks, and provide robustness to deep learning against miscellaneous adversaries. Despite extensive studies focusing on the robustness of image, audio, and NLP, works on adversarial examples of visual object tracking -- especially in a black-box manner -- are quite lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial attack method to generate noises for single object tracking under black-box settings, where perturbations are merely added on initial frames of tracking sequences, which is difficult to be noticed from the perspective of a whole video clip. Specifically, we divide our algorithm into three components and exploit reinforcement learning for localizing important frame patches precisely while reducing unnecessary computational queries overhead. Compared to existing techniques, our method requires fewer queries on initialized frames of a video to manipulate competitive or even better attack performance. We test our algorithm in both long-term and short-term datasets, including OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three mainstream types of trackers: discrimination, Siamese-based, and reinforcement learning-based trackers.      
### 75.Progress and limitations of deep networks to recognize objects in unusual poses  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08034.pdf)
>  Deep networks should be robust to rare events if they are to be successfully deployed in high-stakes real-world applications (e.g., self-driving cars). Here we study the capability of deep networks to recognize objects in unusual poses. We create a synthetic dataset of images of objects in unusual orientations, and evaluate the robustness of a collection of 38 recent and competitive deep networks for image classification. We show that classifying these images is still a challenge for all networks tested, with an average accuracy drop of 29.5% compared to when the objects are presented upright. This brittleness is largely unaffected by various network design choices, such as training losses (e.g., supervised vs. self-supervised), architectures (e.g., convolutional networks vs. transformers), dataset modalities (e.g., images vs. image-text pairs), and data-augmentation schemes. However, networks trained on very large datasets substantially outperform others, with the best network tested$\unicode{x2014}$Noisy Student EfficentNet-L2 trained on JFT-300M$\unicode{x2014}$showing a relatively small accuracy drop of only 14.5% on unusual poses. Nevertheless, a visual inspection of the failures of Noisy Student reveals a remaining gap in robustness with the human visual system. Furthermore, combining multiple object transformations$\unicode{x2014}$3D-rotations and scaling$\unicode{x2014}$further degrades the performance of all networks. Altogether, our results provide another measurement of the robustness of deep networks that is important to consider when using them in the real world.

### 76.LAVA: Language Audio Vision Alignment for Contrastive Video Pre-Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08024.pdf)
>  Generating representations of video data is of key importance in advancing the field of machine perception. Most current techniques rely on hand-annotated data, which can be difficult to work with, expensive to generate, and hard to scale. In this work, we propose a novel learning approach based on contrastive learning, LAVA, which is capable of learning joint language, audio, and video representations in a self-supervised manner. We pre-train LAVA on the Kinetics 700 dataset using transformer encoders to learn representations for each modality. We then demonstrate that LAVA performs competitively with the current state-of-the-art self-supervised and weakly-supervised pretraining techniques on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 video action recognition while using a fraction of the unlabeled data.      
### 77.Monitoring Vegetation From Space at Extremely Fine Resolutions via Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08022.pdf)
>  Monitoring vegetation productivity at extremely fine resolutions is valuable for real-world agricultural applications, such as detecting crop stress and providing early warning of food insecurity. Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) provides a promising way to directly measure plant productivity from space. However, satellite SIF observations are only available at a coarse spatial resolution, making it impossible to monitor how individual crop types or farms are doing. This poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression (or downscaling) task; at training time, we only have SIF labels at a coarse resolution (3km), but we want to predict SIF at much finer spatial resolutions (e.g. 30m, a 100x increase). We also have additional fine-resolution input features, but the relationship between these features and SIF is unknown. To address this, we propose Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net (CS-SUNet), a novel method for this coarse supervision setting. CS-SUNet combines the expressive power of deep convolutional networks with novel regularization methods based on prior knowledge (such as a smoothness loss) that are crucial for preventing overfitting. Experiments show that CS-SUNet resolves fine-grained variations in SIF more accurately than existing methods.      
### 78.SSMTL++: Revisiting Self-Supervised Multi-Task Learning for Video Anomaly Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08003.pdf)
>  A self-supervised multi-task learning (SSMTL) framework for video anomaly detection was recently introduced in literature. Due to its highly accurate results, the method attracted the attention of many researchers. In this work, we revisit the self-supervised multi-task learning framework, proposing several updates to the original method. First, we study various detection methods, e.g. based on detecting high-motion regions using optical flow or background subtraction, since we believe the currently used pre-trained YOLOv3 is suboptimal, e.g. objects in motion or objects from unknown classes are never detected. Second, we modernize the 3D convolutional backbone by introducing multi-head self-attention modules, inspired by the recent success of vision transformers. As such, we alternatively introduce both 2D and 3D convolutional vision transformer (CvT) blocks. Third, in our attempt to further improve the model, we study additional self-supervised learning tasks, such as predicting segmentation maps through knowledge distillation, solving jigsaw puzzles, estimating body pose through knowledge distillation, predicting masked regions (inpainting), and adversarial learning with pseudo-anomalies. We conduct experiments to assess the performance impact of the introduced changes. Upon finding more promising configurations of the framework, dubbed SSMTL++v1 and SSMTL++v2, we extend our preliminary experiments to more data sets, demonstrating that our performance gains are consistent across all data sets. In most cases, our results on Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal raise the state-of-the-art performance to a new level.      
### 79.SVGraph: Learning Semantic Graphs from Instructional Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08001.pdf)
>  In this work, we focus on generating graphical representations of noisy, instructional videos for video understanding. We propose a self-supervised, interpretable approach that does not require any annotations for graphical representations, which would be expensive and time consuming to collect. We attempt to overcome "black box" learning limitations by presenting Semantic Video Graph or SVGraph, a multi-modal approach that utilizes narrations for semantic interpretability of the learned graphs. SVGraph 1) relies on the agreement between multiple modalities to learn a unified graphical structure with the help of cross-modal attention and 2) assigns semantic interpretation with the help of Semantic-Assignment, which captures the semantics from video narration. We perform experiments on multiple datasets and demonstrate the interpretability of SVGraph in semantic graph learning.      
### 80.DiffuStereo: High Quality Human Reconstruction via Diffusion-based Stereo Using Sparse Cameras  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08000.pdf)
>  We propose DiffuStereo, a novel system using only sparse cameras (8 in this work) for high-quality 3D human reconstruction. At its core is a novel diffusion-based stereo module, which introduces diffusion models, a type of powerful generative models, into the iterative stereo matching network. To this end, we design a new diffusion kernel and additional stereo constraints to facilitate stereo matching and depth estimation in the network. We further present a multi-level stereo network architecture to handle high-resolution (up to 4k) inputs without requiring unaffordable memory footprint. Given a set of sparse-view color images of a human, the proposed multi-level diffusion-based stereo network can produce highly accurate depth maps, which are then converted into a high-quality 3D human model through an efficient multi-view fusion strategy. Overall, our method enables automatic reconstruction of human models with quality on par to high-end dense-view camera rigs, and this is achieved using a much more light-weight hardware setup. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin both qualitatively and quantitatively.      
### 81.Knowledge Guided Bidirectional Attention Network for Human-Object Interaction Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07979.pdf)
>  Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging task that requires to distinguish the interaction between a human-object pair. Attention based relation parsing is a popular and effective strategy utilized in HOI. However, current methods execute relation parsing in a "bottom-up" manner. We argue that the independent use of the bottom-up parsing strategy in HOI is counter-intuitive and could lead to the diffusion of attention. Therefore, we introduce a novel knowledge-guided top-down attention into HOI, and propose to model the relation parsing as a "look and search" process: execute scene-context modeling (i.e. look), and then, given the knowledge of the target pair, search visual clues for the discrimination of the interaction between the pair. We implement the process via unifying the bottom-up and top-down attention in a single encoder-decoder based model. The experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performance on the V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets.      
### 82.Learn-to-Decompose: Cascaded Decomposition Network for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Facial Expression Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07973.pdf)
>  Most existing compound facial expression recognition (FER) methods rely on large-scale labeled compound expression data for training. However, collecting such data is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we address the compound FER task in the cross-domain few-shot learning (FSL) setting, which requires only a few samples of compound expressions in the target domain. Specifically, we propose a novel cascaded decomposition network (CDNet), which cascades several learn-to-decompose modules with shared parameters based on a sequential decomposition mechanism, to obtain a transferable feature space. To alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited base classes in our task, a partial regularization strategy is designed to effectively exploit the best of both episodic training and batch training. By training across similar tasks on multiple basic expression datasets, CDNet learns the ability of learn-to-decompose that can be easily adapted to identify unseen compound expressions. Extensive experiments on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild compound expression datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CDNet against several state-of-the-art FSL methods.

### 83.Level Set-Based Camera Pose Estimation From Multiple 2D/3D Ellipse-Ellipsoid Correspondences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07953.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose an object-based camera pose estimation from a single RGB image and a pre-built map of objects, represented with ellipsoidal models. We show that contrary to point correspondences, the definition of a cost function characterizing the projection of a 3D object onto a 2D object detection is not straightforward. We develop an ellipse-ellipse cost based on level sets sampling, demonstrate its nice properties for handling partially visible objects and compare its performance with other common metrics. Finally, we show that the use of a predictive uncertainty on the detected ellipses allows a fair weighting of the contribution of the correspondences which improves the computed pose. The code is released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/tangram/level-set-based-camera-pose-estimation" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 84.Stochastic Attribute Modeling for Face Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07945.pdf)
>  When a high-resolution (HR) image is degraded into a low-resolution (LR) image, the image loses some of the existing information. Consequently, multiple HR images can correspond to the LR image. Most of the existing methods do not consider the uncertainty caused by the stochastic attribute, which can only be probabilistically inferred. Therefore, the predicted HR images are often blurry because the network tries to reflect all possibilities in a single output image. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel face super-resolution (SR) scheme to take into the uncertainty by stochastic modeling. Specifically, the information in LR images is separately encoded into deterministic and stochastic attributes. Furthermore, an Input Conditional Attribute Predictor is proposed and separately trained to predict the partially alive stochastic attributes from only the LR images. Extensive evaluation shows that the proposed method successfully reduces the uncertainty in the learning process and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.      
### 85.Consistency of Implicit and Explicit Features Matters for Monocular 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07933.pdf)
>  Monocular 3D object detection is a common solution for low-cost autonomous agents to perceive their surrounding environment. Monocular detection has progressed into two categories: (1)Direct methods that infer 3D bounding boxes directly from a frontal-view image; (2)3D intermedia representation methods that map image features to 3D space for subsequent 3D detection. The second category is standing out not only because 3D detection forges ahead at the mercy of more meaningful and representative features, but because of emerging SOTA end-to-end prediction and planning paradigms that require a bird's-eye-view feature map from a perception pipeline. However, in transforming to 3D representation, these methods do not guarantee that objects' implicit orientations and locations in latent space are consistent with those explicitly observed in Euclidean space, which will hurt model performance. Hence, we argue that the consistency of implicit and explicit features matters and present a novel monocular detection method, named CIEF, with the first orientation-aware image backbone to eliminate the disparity of implicit and explicit features in subsequent 3D representation. As a second contribution, we introduce a ray attention mechanism. In contrast to previous methods that repeat features along the projection ray or rely on another intermedia frustum point cloud, we directly transform image features to voxel representations with well-localized features. We also propose a handcrafted gaussian positional encoding function that outperforms the sinusoidal encoding function but maintains the benefit of being continuous. CIEF ranked 1st among all reported methods on both 3D and BEV detection benchmark of KITTI at submission time.      
### 86.Semi-Supervised Keypoint Detector and Descriptor for Retinal Image Matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07932.pdf)
>  For retinal image matching (RIM), we propose SuperRetina, the first end-to-end method with jointly trainable keypoint detector and descriptor. SuperRetina is trained in a novel semi-supervised manner. A small set of (nearly 100) images are incompletely labeled and used to supervise the network to detect keypoints on the vascular tree. To attack the incompleteness of manual labeling, we propose Progressive Keypoint Expansion to enrich the keypoint labels at each training epoch. By utilizing a keypoint-based improved triplet loss as its description loss, SuperRetina produces highly discriminative descriptors at full input image size. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets justify the viability of SuperRetina. Even with manual labeling replaced by auto labeling and thus making the training process fully manual-annotation free, SuperRetina compares favorably against a number of strong baselines for two RIM tasks, i.e. image registration and identity verification. SuperRetina will be open source.      
### 87.Towards Lightweight Super-Resolution with Dual Regression Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07929.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have exhibited remarkable performance in image super-resolution (SR) tasks by learning a mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. However, the SR problem is typically an ill-posed problem and existing methods would come with several limitations. First, the possible mapping space of SR can be extremely large since there may exist many different HR images that can be downsampled to the same LR image. As a result, it is hard to directly learn a promising SR mapping from such a large space. Second, it is often inevitable to develop very large models with extremely high computational cost to yield promising SR performance. In practice, one can use model compression techniques to obtain compact models by reducing model redundancy. Nevertheless, it is hard for existing model compression methods to accurately identify the redundant components due to the extremely large SR mapping space. To alleviate the first challenge, we propose a dual regression learning scheme to reduce the space of possible SR mappings. Specifically, in addition to the mapping from LR to HR images, we learn an additional dual regression mapping to estimate the downsampling kernel and reconstruct LR images. In this way, the dual mapping acts as a constraint to reduce the space of possible mappings. To address the second challenge, we propose a lightweight dual regression compression method to reduce model redundancy in both layer-level and channel-level based on channel pruning. Specifically, we first develop a channel number search method that minimizes the dual regression loss to determine the redundancy of each layer. Given the searched channel numbers, we further exploit the dual regression manner to evaluate the importance of channels and prune the redundant ones. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in obtaining accurate and efficient SR models.      
### 88.Learning Quality-aware Dynamic Memory for Video Object Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07922.pdf)
>  Recently, several spatial-temporal memory-based methods have verified that storing intermediate frames and their masks as memory are helpful to segment target objects in videos. However, they mainly focus on better matching between the current frame and the memory frames without explicitly paying attention to the quality of the memory. Therefore, frames with poor segmentation masks are prone to be memorized, which leads to a segmentation mask error accumulation problem and further affect the segmentation performance. In addition, the linear increase of memory frames with the growth of frame number also limits the ability of the models to handle long videos. To this end, we propose a Quality-aware Dynamic Memory Network (QDMN) to evaluate the segmentation quality of each frame, allowing the memory bank to selectively store accurately segmented frames to prevent the error accumulation problem. Then, we combine the segmentation quality with temporal consistency to dynamically update the memory bank to improve the practicability of the models. Without any bells and whistles, our QDMN achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both DAVIS and YouTube-VOS benchmarks. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Quality Assessment Module (QAM) can be applied to memory-based methods as generic plugins and significantly improves performance.

### 89.CNN-based Euler's Elastica Inpainting with Deep Energy and Deep Image Prior  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07921.pdf)
>  Euler's elastica constitute an appealing variational image inpainting model. It minimises an energy that involves the total variation as well as the level line curvature. These components are transparent and make it attractive for shape completion tasks. However, its gradient flow is a singular, anisotropic, and nonlinear PDE of fourth order, which is numerically challenging: It is difficult to find efficient algorithms that offer sharp edges and good rotation invariance. As a remedy, we design the first neural algorithm that simulates inpainting with Euler's Elastica. We use the deep energy concept which employs the variational energy as neural network loss. Furthermore, we pair it with a deep image prior where the network architecture itself acts as a prior. This yields better inpaintings by steering the optimisation trajectory closer to the desired solution. Our results are qualitatively on par with state-of-the-art algorithms on elastica-based shape completion. They combine good rotation invariance with sharp edges. Moreover, we benefit from the high efficiency and effortless parallelisation within a neural framework. Our neural elastica approach only requires 3x3 central difference stencils. It is thus much simpler than other well-performing algorithms for elastica inpainting. Last but not least, it is unsupervised as it requires no ground truth training data.      
### 90.Explainable vision transformer enabled convolutional neural network for plant disease identification: PlantXViT  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07919.pdf)
>  Plant diseases are the primary cause of crop losses globally, with an impact on the world economy. To deal with these issues, smart agriculture solutions are evolving that combine the Internet of Things and machine learning for early disease detection and control. Many such systems use vision-based machine learning methods for real-time disease detection and diagnosis. With the advancement in deep learning techniques, new methods have emerged that employ convolutional neural networks for plant disease detection and identification. Another trend in vision-based deep learning is the use of vision transformers, which have proved to be powerful models for classification and other problems. However, vision transformers have rarely been investigated for plant pathology applications. In this study, a Vision Transformer enabled Convolutional Neural Network model called "PlantXViT" is proposed for plant disease identification. The proposed model combines the capabilities of traditional convolutional neural networks with the Vision Transformers to efficiently identify a large number of plant diseases for several crops. The proposed model has a lightweight structure with only 0.8 million trainable parameters, which makes it suitable for IoT-based smart agriculture services. The performance of PlantXViT is evaluated on five publicly available datasets. The proposed PlantXViT network performs better than five state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets. The average accuracy for recognising plant diseases is shown to exceed 93.55%, 92.59%, and 98.33% on Apple, Maize, and Rice datasets, respectively, even under challenging background conditions. The efficiency in terms of explainability of the proposed model is evaluated using gradient-weighted class activation maps and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation.      
### 91.Dual-branch Hybrid Learning Network for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07913.pdf)
>  The current studies of Scene Graph Generation (SGG) focus on solving the long-tailed problem for generating unbiased scene graphs. However, most de-biasing methods overemphasize the tail predicates and underestimate head ones throughout training, thereby wrecking the representation ability of head predicate features. Furthermore, these impaired features from head predicates harm the learning of tail predicates. In fact, the inference of tail predicates heavily depends on the general patterns learned from head ones, e.g., "standing on" depends on "on". Thus, these de-biasing SGG methods can neither achieve excellent performance on tail predicates nor satisfying behaviors on head ones. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-branch Hybrid Learning network (DHL) to take care of both head predicates and tail ones for SGG, including a Coarse-grained Learning Branch (CLB) and a Fine-grained Learning Branch (FLB). Specifically, the CLB is responsible for learning expertise and robust features of head predicates, while the FLB is expected to predict informative tail predicates. Furthermore, DHL is equipped with a Branch Curriculum Schedule (BCS) to make the two branches work well together. Experiments show that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on VG and GQA datasets and makes a trade-off between the performance of tail predicates and head ones. Moreover, extensive experiments on two downstream tasks (i.e., Image Captioning and Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval) further verify the generalization and practicability of our method.      
### 92.Mutual Adaptive Reasoning for Monocular 3D Multi-Person Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07900.pdf)
>  Inter-person occlusion and depth ambiguity make estimating the 3D poses of monocular multiple persons as camera-centric coordinates a challenging problem. Typical top-down frameworks suffer from high computational redundancy with an additional detection stage. By contrast, the bottom-up methods enjoy low computational costs as they are less affected by the number of humans. However, most existing bottom-up methods treat camera-centric 3D human pose estimation as two unrelated subtasks: 2.5D pose estimation and camera-centric depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a unified model that leverages the mutual benefits of both these subtasks. Within the framework, a robust structured 2.5D pose estimation is designed to recognize inter-person occlusion based on depth relationships. Additionally, we develop an end-to-end geometry-aware depth reasoning method that exploits the mutual benefits of both 2.5D pose and camera-centric root depths. This method first uses 2.5D pose and geometry information to infer camera-centric root depths in a forward pass, and then exploits the root depths to further improve representation learning of 2.5D pose estimation in a backward pass. Further, we designed an adaptive fusion scheme that leverages both visual perception and body geometry to alleviate inherent depth ambiguity issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over a wide range of bottom-up methods. Our accuracy is even competitive with top-down counterparts. Notably, our model runs much faster than existing bottom-up and top-down methods.      
### 93.SPSN: Superpixel Prototype Sampling Network for RGB-D Salient Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07898.pdf)
>  RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) has been in the spotlight recently because it is an important preprocessing operation for various vision tasks. However, despite advances in deep learning-based methods, RGB-D SOD is still challenging due to the large domain gap between an RGB image and the depth map and low-quality depth maps. To solve this problem, we propose a novel superpixel prototype sampling network (SPSN) architecture. The proposed model splits the input RGB image and depth map into component superpixels to generate component prototypes. We design a prototype sampling network so that the network only samples prototypes corresponding to salient objects. In addition, we propose a reliance selection module to recognize the quality of each RGB and depth feature map and adaptively weight them in proportion to their reliability. The proposed method makes the model robust to inconsistencies between RGB images and depth maps and eliminates the influence of non-salient objects. Our method is evaluated on five popular datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparative experiments.      
### 94.Cross Vision-RF Gait Re-identification with Low-cost RGB-D Cameras and mmWave Radars  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07896.pdf)
>  Human identification is a key requirement for many applications in everyday life, such as personalized services, automatic surveillance, continuous authentication, and contact tracing during pandemics, etc. This work studies the problem of cross-modal human re-identification (ReID), in response to the regular human movements across camera-allowed regions (e.g., streets) and camera-restricted regions (e.g., offices) deployed with heterogeneous sensors. By leveraging the emerging low-cost RGB-D cameras and mmWave radars, we propose the first-of-its-kind vision-RF system for cross-modal multi-person ReID at the same time. Firstly, to address the fundamental inter-modality discrepancy, we propose a novel signature synthesis algorithm based on the observed specular reflection model of a human body. Secondly, an effective cross-modal deep metric learning model is introduced to deal with interference caused by unsynchronized data across radars and cameras. Through extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, we demonstrate that our proposed system is able to achieve ~92.5% top-1 accuracy and ~97.5% top-5 accuracy out of 56 volunteers. We also show that our proposed system is able to robustly reidentify subjects even when multiple subjects are present in the sensors' field of view.      
### 95.JPerceiver: Joint Perception Network for Depth, Pose and Layout Estimation in Driving Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07895.pdf)
>  Depth estimation, visual odometry (VO), and bird's-eye-view (BEV) scene layout estimation present three critical tasks for driving scene perception, which is fundamental for motion planning and navigation in autonomous driving. Though they are complementary to each other, prior works usually focus on each individual task and rarely deal with all three tasks together. A naive way is to accomplish them independently in a sequential or parallel manner, but there are many drawbacks, i.e., 1) the depth and VO results suffer from the inherent scale ambiguity issue; 2) the BEV layout is directly predicted from the front-view image without using any depth-related information, although the depth map contains useful geometry clues for inferring scene layouts. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a novel joint perception framework named JPerceiver, which can simultaneously estimate scale-aware depth and VO as well as BEV layout from a monocular video sequence. It exploits the cross-view geometric transformation (CGT) to propagate the absolute scale from the road layout to depth and VO based on a carefully-designed scale loss. Meanwhile, a cross-view and cross-modal transfer (CCT) module is devised to leverage the depth clues for reasoning road and vehicle layout through an attention mechanism. JPerceiver can be trained in an end-to-end multi-task learning way, where the CGT scale loss and CCT module promote inter-task knowledge transfer to benefit feature learning of each task. Experiments on Argoverse, Nuscenes and KITTI show the superiority of JPerceiver over existing methods on all the above three tasks in terms of accuracy, model size, and inference speed. The code and models are available at~\href{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/sunnyHelen/JPerceiver" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/sunnyHelen/JPerceiver" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 96.Multi-Modal Unsupervised Pre-Training for Surgical Operating Room Workflow Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07894.pdf)
>  Data-driven approaches to assist operating room (OR) workflow analysis depend on large curated datasets that are time consuming and expensive to collect. On the other hand, we see a recent paradigm shift from supervised learning to self-supervised and/or unsupervised learning approaches that can learn representations from unlabeled datasets. In this paper, we leverage the unlabeled data captured in robotic surgery ORs and propose a novel way to fuse the multi-modal data for a single video frame or image. Instead of producing different augmentations (or 'views') of the same image or video frame which is a common practice in self-supervised learning, we treat the multi-modal data as different views to train the model in an unsupervised manner via clustering. We compared our method with other state of the art methods and results show the superior performance of our approach on surgical video activity recognition and semantic segmentation.      
### 97.You Should Look at All Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07889.pdf)
>  Feature pyramid network (FPN) is one of the key components for object detectors. However, there is a long-standing puzzle for researchers that the detection performance of large-scale objects are usually suppressed after introducing FPN. To this end, this paper first revisits FPN in the detection framework and reveals the nature of the success of FPN from the perspective of optimization. Then, we point out that the degraded performance of large-scale objects is due to the arising of improper back-propagation paths after integrating FPN. It makes each level of the backbone network only has the ability to look at the objects within a certain scale range. Based on these analysis, two feasible strategies are proposed to enable each level of the backbone to look at all objects in the FPN-based detection frameworks. Specifically, one is to introduce auxiliary objective functions to make each backbone level directly receive the back-propagation signals of various-scale objects during training. The other is to construct the feature pyramid in a more reasonable way to avoid the irrational back-propagation paths. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark validate the soundness of our analysis and the effectiveness of our methods. Without bells and whistles, we demonstrate that our method achieves solid improvements (more than 2%) on various detection frameworks: one-stage, two-stage, anchor-based, anchor-free and transformer-based detectors.      
### 98.Clover: Towards A Unified Video-Language Alignment and Fusion Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07885.pdf)
>  Building a universal video-language model for solving various video understanding tasks (e.g., text-video retrieval, video question answering) is an open challenge to the machine learning field. Towards this goal, most recent attempts train the models, usually consisting of uni-modal and cross-modal feature encoders, with supervised or pair-wise contrastive pre-text tasks. Though offering attractive generality, the resulted models have to compromise between efficiency and performance. We argue the flaws are caused by their pre-training strategies\textemdash they cannot well align and fuse features from different modalities simultaneously. We then introduce Clover -- a Correlated Video-Language pre-training method -- towards a universal video-language model for solving multiple video understanding tasks with neither performance nor efficiency compromise. It improves cross-modal feature alignment and fusion via a novel tri-modal alignment pre-training task. Additionally, we propose to enhance the tri-modal alignment via incorporating learning from masked samples and a novel pair-wise ranking loss. Clover demonstrates outstanding generality. It establishes new state-of-the-arts on multiple downstream tasks, including three retrieval tasks for both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, and eight video question answering tasks.

### 99.NeFSAC: Neurally Filtered Minimal Samples  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07872.pdf)
>  Since RANSAC, a great deal of research has been devoted to improving both its accuracy and run-time. Still, only a few methods aim at recognizing invalid minimal samples early, before the often expensive model estimation and quality calculation are done. To this end, we propose NeFSAC, an efficient algorithm for neural filtering of motion-inconsistent and poorly-conditioned minimal samples. We train NeFSAC to predict the probability of a minimal sample leading to an accurate relative pose, only based on the pixel coordinates of the image correspondences. Our neural filtering model learns typical motion patterns of samples which lead to unstable poses, and regularities in the possible motions to favour well-conditioned and likely-correct samples. The novel lightweight architecture implements the main invariants of minimal samples for pose estimation, and a novel training scheme addresses the problem of extreme class imbalance. NeFSAC can be plugged into any existing RANSAC-based pipeline. We integrate it into USAC and show that it consistently provides strong speed-ups even under extreme train-test domain gaps - for example, the model trained for the autonomous driving scenario works on PhotoTourism too. We tested NeFSAC on more than 100k image pairs from three publicly available real-world datasets and found that it leads to one order of magnitude speed-up, while often finding more accurate results than USAC alone.

### 100.CA-SpaceNet: Counterfactual Analysis for 6D Pose Estimation in Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07869.pdf)
>  Reliable and stable 6D pose estimation of uncooperative space objects plays an essential role in on-orbit servicing and debris removal missions. Considering that the pose estimator is sensitive to background interference, this paper proposes a counterfactual analysis framework named CASpaceNet to complete robust 6D pose estimation of the spaceborne targets under complicated background. Specifically, conventional methods are adopted to extract the features of the whole image in the factual case. In the counterfactual case, a non-existent image without the target but only the background is imagined. Side effect caused by background interference is reduced by counterfactual analysis, which leads to unbiased prediction in final results. In addition, we also carry out lowbit-width quantization for CA-SpaceNet and deploy part of the framework to a Processing-In-Memory (PIM) accelerator on FPGA. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. To our best knowledge, this paper applies causal inference and network quantization to the 6D pose estimation of space-borne targets for the first time.

### 101.CLOSE: Curriculum Learning On the Sharing Extent Towards Better One-shot NAS  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07868.pdf)
>  One-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely used to discover architectures due to its efficiency. However, previous studies reveal that one-shot performance estimations of architectures might not be well correlated with their performances in stand-alone training because of the excessive sharing of operation parameters (i.e., large sharing extent) between architectures. Thus, recent methods construct even more over-parameterized supernets to reduce the sharing extent. But these improved methods introduce a large number of extra parameters and thus cause an undesirable trade-off between the training costs and the ranking quality. To alleviate the above issues, we propose to apply Curriculum Learning On Sharing Extent (CLOSE) to train the supernet both efficiently and effectively. Specifically, we train the supernet with a large sharing extent (an easier curriculum) at the beginning and gradually decrease the sharing extent of the supernet (a harder curriculum). To support this training strategy, we design a novel supernet (CLOSENet) that decouples the parameters from operations to realize a flexible sharing scheme and adjustable sharing extent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLOSE can obtain a better ranking quality across different computational budget constraints than other one-shot supernets, and is able to discover superior architectures when combined with various search strategies.

### 102.Automatic dataset generation for specific object detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07867.pdf)
>  In the past decade, object detection tasks are defined mostly by large public datasets. However, building object detection datasets is not scalable due to inefficient image collecting and labeling. Furthermore, most labels are still in the form of bounding boxes, which provide much less information than the real human visual system. In this paper, we present a method to synthesize object-in-scene images, which can preserve the objects' detailed features without bringing irrelevant information. In brief, given a set of images containing a target object, our algorithm first trains a model to find an approximate center of the object as an anchor, then makes an outline regression to estimate its boundary, and finally blends the object into a new scene. Our result shows that in the synthesized image, the boundaries of objects blend very well with the background. Experiments also show that SOTA segmentation models work well with our synthesized data.      
### 103.The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Self-attention in Convolutional Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07858.pdf)
>  Recently many plug-and-play self-attention modules (SAMs) are proposed to enhance the model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In general, previous works ignore where to plug in the SAMs since they connect the SAMs individually with each block of the entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental computational cost and the number of parameters with the growth of network depth. However, we empirically find and verify some counterintuitive phenomena that: (a) Connecting the SAMs to all the blocks may not always bring the largest performance boost, and connecting to partial blocks would be even better; (b) Adding the SAMs to a CNN may not always bring a performance boost, and instead it may even harm the performance of the original CNN backbone. Therefore, we articulate and demonstrate the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Self-attention Networks: a full self-attention network contains a subnetwork with sparse self-attention connections that can (1) accelerate inference, (2) reduce extra parameter increment, and (3) maintain accuracy. In addition to the empirical evidence, this hypothesis is also supported by our theoretical evidence. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective reinforcement-learning-based method to search the ticket, i.e., the connection scheme that satisfies the three above-mentioned conditions. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets and popular self-attention networks show the effectiveness of our method. Besides, our experiments illustrate that our searched ticket has the capacity of transferring to some vision tasks, e.g., crowd counting and segmentation.      
### 104.TS2-Net: Token Shift and Selection Transformer for Text-Video Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07852.pdf)
>  Text-Video retrieval is a task of great practical value and has received increasing attention, among which learning spatial-temporal video representation is one of the research hotspots. The video encoders in the state-of-the-art video retrieval models usually directly adopt the pre-trained vision backbones with the network structure fixed, they therefore can not be further improved to produce the fine-grained spatial-temporal video representation. In this paper, we propose Token Shift and Selection Network (TS2-Net), a novel token shift and selection transformer architecture, which dynamically adjusts the token sequence and selects informative tokens in both temporal and spatial dimensions from input video samples. The token shift module temporally shifts the whole token features back-and-forth across adjacent frames, to preserve the complete token representation and capture subtle movements. Then the token selection module selects tokens that contribute most to local spatial semantics. Based on thorough experiments, the proposed TS2-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on major text-video retrieval benchmarks, including new records on MSRVTT, VATEX, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo.      
### 105.Structural Prior Guided Generative Adversarial Transformers for Low-Light Image Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07828.pdf)
>  We propose an effective Structural Prior guided Generative Adversarial Transformer (SPGAT) to solve low-light image enhancement. Our SPGAT mainly contains a generator with two discriminators and a structural prior estimator (SPE). The generator is based on a U-shaped Transformer which is used to explore non-local information for better clear image restoration. The SPE is used to explore useful structures from images to guide the generator for better structural detail estimation. To generate more realistic images, we develop a new structural prior guided adversarial learning method by building the skip connections between the generator and discriminators so that the discriminators can better discriminate between real and fake features. Finally, we propose a parallel windows-based Swin Transformer block to aggregate different level hierarchical features for high-quality image restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SPGAT performs favorably against recent state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.      
### 106.Cross-Domain Cross-Set Few-Shot Learning via Learning Compact and Aligned Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07826.pdf)
>  Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel queries with only a few support samples through leveraging prior knowledge from a base dataset. In this paper, we consider the domain shift problem in FSL and aim to address the domain gap between the support set and the query set. Different from previous cross-domain FSL work (CD-FSL) that considers the domain shift between base and novel classes, the new problem, termed cross-domain cross-set FSL (CDSC-FSL), requires few-shot learners not only to adapt to the new domain, but also to be consistent between different domains within each novel class. To this end, we propose a novel approach, namely stabPA, to learn prototypical compact and cross-domain aligned representations, so that the domain shift and few-shot learning can be addressed simultaneously. We evaluate our approach on two new CDCS-FSL benchmarks built from the DomainNet and Office-Home datasets respectively. Remarkably, our approach outperforms multiple elaborated baselines by a large margin, e.g., improving 5-shot accuracy by 6.0 points on average on DomainNet.

### 107.Bagging Regional Classification Activation Maps for Weakly Supervised Object Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07818.pdf)
>  Classification activation map (CAM), utilizing the classification structure to generate pixel-wise localization maps, is a crucial mechanism for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). However, CAM directly uses the classifier trained on image-level features to locate objects, making it prefers to discern global discriminative factors rather than regional object cues. Thus only the discriminative locations are activated when feeding pixel-level features into this classifier. To solve this issue, this paper elaborates a plug-and-play mechanism called BagCAMs to better project a well-trained classifier for the localization task without refining or re-training the baseline structure. Our BagCAMs adopts a proposed regional localizer generation (RLG) strategy to define a set of regional localizers and then derive them from a well-trained classifier. These regional localizers can be viewed as the base learner that only discerns region-wise object factors for localization tasks, and their results can be effectively weighted by our BagCAMs to form the final localization map. Experiments indicate that adopting our proposed BagCAMs can improve the performance of baseline WSOL methods to a great extent and obtains state-of-the-art performance on three WSOL benchmarks.

### 108.Self-calibrating Photometric Stereo by Neural Inverse Rendering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07815.pdf)
>  This paper tackles the task of uncalibrated photometric stereo for 3D object reconstruction, where both the object shape, object reflectance, and lighting directions are unknown. This is an extremely difficult task, and the challenge is further compounded with the existence of the well-known generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity in photometric stereo. Previous methods to resolve this ambiguity either rely on an overly simplified reflectance model, or assume special light distribution. We propose a new method that jointly optimizes object shape, light directions, and light intensities, all under general surfaces and lights assumptions. The specularities are used explicitly to solve uncalibrated photometric stereo via a neural inverse rendering process. We gradually fit specularities from shiny to rough using novel progressive specular bases. Our method leverages a physically based rendering equation by minimizing the reconstruction error on a per-object-basis. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in light estimation and shape recovery on real-world datasets.      
### 109.Masked Spatial-Spectral Autoencoders Are Excellent Hyperspectral Defenders  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07803.pdf)
>  Deep learning methodology contributes a lot to the development of hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis community. However, it also makes HSI analysis systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To this end, we propose a masked spatial-spectral autoencoder (MSSA) in this paper under self-supervised learning theory, for enhancing the robustness of HSI analysis systems. First, a masked sequence attention learning module is conducted to promote the inherent robustness of HSI analysis systems along spectral channel. Then, we develop a graph convolutional network with learnable graph structure to establish global pixel-wise <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://combinations.In" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> this way, the attack effect would be dispersed by all the related pixels among each combination, and a better defense performance is achievable in spatial aspect.Finally, to improve the defense transferability and address the problem of limited labelled samples, MSSA employs spectra reconstruction as a pretext task and fits the datasets in a self-supervised manner.Comprehensive experiments over three benchmarks verify the effectiveness of MSSA in comparison with the state-of-the-art hyperspectral classification methods and representative adversarial defense strategies.      
### 110.Learning Granularity-Unified Representations for Text-to-Image Person Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07802.pdf)
>  Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) aims to search for pedestrian images of an interested identity via textual descriptions. It is challenging due to both rich intra-modal variations and significant inter-modal gaps. Existing works usually ignore the difference in feature granularity between the two modalities, i.e., the visual features are usually fine-grained while textual features are coarse, which is mainly responsible for the large inter-modal gaps. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework based on transformers to learn granularity-unified representations for both modalities, denoted as LGUR. LGUR framework contains two modules: a Dictionary-based Granularity Alignment (DGA) module and a Prototype-based Granularity Unification (PGU) module. In DGA, in order to align the granularities of two modalities, we introduce a Multi-modality Shared Dictionary (MSD) to reconstruct both visual and textual features. Besides, DGA has two important factors, i.e., the cross-modality guidance and the foreground-centric reconstruction, to facilitate the optimization of MSD. In PGU, we adopt a set of shared and learnable prototypes as the queries to extract diverse and semantically aligned features for both modalities in the granularity-unified feature space, which further promotes the ReID performance. Comprehensive experiments show that our LGUR consistently outperforms state-of-the-arts by large margins on both CUHK-PEDES and ICFG-PEDES datasets.

### 111.CharFormer: A Glyph Fusion based Attentive Framework for High-precision Character Image Denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07798.pdf)
>  Degraded images commonly exist in the general sources of character images, leading to unsatisfactory character recognition results. Existing methods have dedicated efforts to restoring degraded character images. However, the denoising results obtained by these methods do not appear to improve character recognition performance. This is mainly because current methods only focus on pixel-level information and ignore critical features of a character, such as its glyph, resulting in character-glyph damage during the denoising process. In this paper, we introduce a novel generic framework based on glyph fusion and attention mechanisms, i.e., CharFormer, for precisely recovering character images without changing their inherent glyphs. Unlike existing frameworks, CharFormer introduces a parallel target task for capturing additional information and injecting it into the image denoising backbone, which will maintain the consistency of character glyphs during character image denoising. Moreover, we utilize attention-based networks for global-local feature interaction, which will help to deal with blind denoising and enhance denoising performance. We compare CharFormer with state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of CharFormer quantitatively and qualitatively.      
### 112.CARBEN: Composite Adversarial Robustness Benchmark  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07797.pdf)
>  Prior literature on adversarial attack methods has mainly focused on attacking with and defending against a single threat model, e.g., perturbations bounded in Lp ball. However, multiple threat models can be combined into composite perturbations. One such approach, composite adversarial attack (CAA), not only expands the perturbable space of the image, but also may be overlooked by current modes of robustness evaluation. This paper demonstrates how CAA's attack order affects the resulting image, and provides real-time inferences of different models, which will facilitate users' configuration of the parameters of the attack level and their rapid evaluation of model prediction. A leaderboard to benchmark adversarial robustness against CAA is also introduced.      
### 113.RCRN: Real-world Character Image Restoration Network via Skeleton Extraction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07795.pdf)
>  Constructing high-quality character image datasets is challenging because real-world images are often affected by image degradation. There are limitations when applying current image restoration methods to such real-world character images, since (i) the categories of noise in character images are different from those in general images; (ii) real-world character images usually contain more complex image degradation, e.g., mixed noise at different noise levels. To address these problems, we propose a real-world character restoration network (RCRN) to effectively restore degraded character images, where character skeleton information and scale-ensemble feature extraction are utilized to obtain better restoration performance. The proposed method consists of a skeleton extractor (SENet) and a character image restorer (CiRNet). SENet aims to preserve the structural consistency of the character and normalize complex noise. Then, CiRNet reconstructs clean images from degraded character images and their skeletons. Due to the lack of benchmarks for real-world character image restoration, we constructed a dataset containing 1,606 character images with real-world degradation to evaluate the validity of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that RCRN outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.      
### 114.Towards the Desirable Decision Boundary by Moderate-Margin Adversarial Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07793.pdf)
>  Adversarial training, as one of the most effective defense methods against adversarial attacks, tends to learn an inclusive decision boundary to increase the robustness of deep learning models. However, due to the large and unnecessary increase in the margin along adversarial directions, adversarial training causes heavy cross-over between natural examples and adversarial examples, which is not conducive to balancing the trade-off between robustness and natural accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training scheme to achieve a better trade-off between robustness and natural accuracy. It aims to learn a moderate-inclusive decision boundary, which means that the margins of natural examples under the decision boundary are moderate. We call this scheme Moderate-Margin Adversarial Training (MMAT), which generates finer-grained adversarial examples to mitigate the cross-over problem. We also take advantage of logits from a teacher model that has been well-trained to guide the learning of our model. Finally, MMAT achieves high natural accuracy and robustness under both black-box and white-box attacks. On SVHN, for example, state-of-the-art robustness and natural accuracy are achieved.      
### 115.Learning Long-Term Spatial-Temporal Graphs for Active Speaker Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07783.pdf)
>  Active speaker detection (ASD) in videos with multiple speakers is a challenging task as it requires learning effective audiovisual features and spatial-temporal correlations over long temporal windows. In this paper, we present SPELL, a novel spatial-temporal graph learning framework that can solve complex tasks such as ASD. To this end, each person in a video frame is first encoded in a unique node for that frame. Nodes corresponding to a single person across frames are connected to encode their temporal dynamics. Nodes within a frame are also connected to encode inter-person relationships. Thus, SPELL reduces ASD to a node classification task. Importantly, SPELL is able to reason over long temporal contexts for all nodes without relying on computationally expensive fully connected graph neural networks. Through extensive experiments on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset, we demonstrate that learning graph-based representations can significantly improve the active speaker detection performance owing to its explicit spatial and temporal structure. SPELL outperforms all previous state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly lower memory and computational resources.

### 116.Human keypoint detection for close proximity human-robot interaction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07742.pdf)
>  We study the performance of state-of-the-art human keypoint detectors in the context of close proximity human-robot interaction. The detection in this scenario is specific in that only a subset of body parts such as hands and torso are in the field of view. In particular, (i) we survey existing datasets with human pose annotation from the perspective of close proximity images and prepare and make publicly available a new Human in Close Proximity (HiCP) dataset; (ii) we quantitatively and qualitatively compare state-of-the-art human whole-body 2D keypoint detection methods (OpenPose, MMPose, AlphaPose, Detectron2) on this dataset; (iii) since accurate detection of hands and fingers is critical in applications with handovers, we evaluate the performance of the MediaPipe hand detector; (iv) we deploy the algorithms on a humanoid robot with an RGB-D camera on its head and evaluate the performance in 3D human keypoint detection. A motion capture system is used as reference. <br>The best performing whole-body keypoint detectors in close proximity were MMPose and AlphaPose, but both had difficulty with finger detection. Thus, we propose a combination of MMPose or AlphaPose for the body and MediaPipe for the hands in a single framework providing the most accurate and robust detection. We also analyse the failure modes of individual detectors -- for example, to what extent the absence of the head of the person in the image degrades performance. Finally, we demonstrate the framework in a scenario where a humanoid robot interacting with a person uses the detected 3D keypoints for whole-body avoidance maneuvers.      
### 117.Adversarial Focal Loss: Asking Your Discriminator for Hard Examples  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07739.pdf)
>  Focal Loss has reached incredible popularity as it uses a simple technique to identify and utilize hard examples to achieve better performance on classification. However, this method does not easily generalize outside of classification tasks, such as in keypoint detection. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation of Focal Loss for keypoint detection tasks, called Adversarial Focal Loss (AFL). AFL not only is semantically analogous to Focal loss, but also works as a plug-and-chug upgrade for arbitrary loss functions. While Focal Loss requires output from a classifier, AFL leverages a separate adversarial network to produce a difficulty score for each input. This difficulty score can then be used to dynamically prioritize learning on hard examples, even in absence of a classifier. In this work, we show AFL's effectiveness in enhancing existing methods in keypoint detection and verify its capability to re-weigh examples based on difficulty.      
### 118.Interpolation, extrapolation, and local generalization in common neural networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08648.pdf)
>  There has been a long history of works showing that neural networks have hard time extrapolating beyond the training set. A recent study by Balestriero et al. (2021) challenges this view: defining interpolation as the state of belonging to the convex hull of the training set, they show that the test set, either in input or neural space, cannot lie for the most part in this convex hull, due to the high dimensionality of the data, invoking the well known curse of dimensionality. Neural networks are then assumed to necessarily work in extrapolative mode. We here study the neural activities of the last hidden layer of typical neural networks. Using an autoencoder to uncover the intrinsic space underlying the neural activities, we show that this space is actually low-dimensional, and that the better the model, the lower the dimensionality of this intrinsic space. In this space, most samples of the test set actually lie in the convex hull of the training set: under the convex hull definition, the models thus happen to work in interpolation regime. Moreover, we show that belonging to the convex hull does not seem to be the relevant criteria. Different measures of proximity to the training set are actually better related to performance accuracy. Thus, typical neural networks do seem to operate in interpolation regime. Good generalization performances are linked to the ability of a neural network to operate well in such a regime.      
### 119.CACTUSS: Common Anatomical CT-US Space for US examinations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08619.pdf)
>  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disease in which a section of the aorta enlarges, weakening its walls and potentially rupturing the vessel. Abdominal ultrasound has been utilized for diagnostics, but due to its limited image quality and operator dependency, CT scans are usually required for monitoring and treatment planning. Recently, abdominal CT datasets have been successfully utilized to train deep neural networks for automatic aorta segmentation. Knowledge gathered from this solved task could therefore be leveraged to improve US segmentation for AAA diagnosis and monitoring. To this end, we propose CACTUSS: a common anatomical CT-US space, which acts as a virtual bridge between CT and US modalities to enable automatic AAA screening sonography. CACTUSS makes use of publicly available labelled data to learn to segment based on an intermediary representation that inherits properties from both US and CT. We train a segmentation network in this new representation and employ an additional image-to-image translation network which enables our model to perform on real B-mode images. Quantitative comparisons against fully supervised methods demonstrate the capabilities of CACTUSS in terms of Dice Score and diagnostic metrics, showing that our method also meets the clinical requirements for AAA scanning and diagnosis.      
### 120.Symmetrized Robust Procrustes: Constant-Factor Approximation and Exact Recovery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08592.pdf)
>  The classical $\textit{Procrustes}$ problem is to find a rigid motion (orthogonal transformation and translation) that best aligns two given point-sets in the least-squares sense. The $\textit{Robust Procrustes}$ problem is an important variant, in which a power-1 objective is used instead of least squares to improve robustness to outliers. While the optimal solution of the least-squares problem can be easily computed in closed form, dating back to Schönemann (1966), no such solution is known for the power-1 problem. In this paper we propose a novel convex relaxation for the Robust Procrustes problem. Our relaxation enjoys several theoretical and practical advantages: Theoretically, we prove that our method provides a $\sqrt{2}$-factor approximation to the Robust Procrustes problem, and that, under appropriate assumptions, it exactly recovers the true rigid motion from point correspondences contaminated by outliers. In practice, we find in numerical experiments on both synthetic and real robust Procrustes problems, that our method performs similarly to the standard Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS). However the convexity of our algorithm allows incorporating additional convex penalties, which are not readily amenable to IRLS. This turns out to be a substantial advantage, leading to improved results in high-dimensional problems, including non-rigid shape alignment and semi-supervised interlingual word translation.      
### 121.Study of the performance and scalability of federated learning for medical imaging with intermittent clients  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08581.pdf)
>  Federated learning is a data decentralization privacy-preserving technique used to perform machine or deep learning in a secure way. In this paper we present theoretical aspects about federated learning, such as the presentation of an aggregation operator, different types of federated learning, and issues to be taken into account in relation to the distribution of data from the clients, together with the exhaustive analysis of a use case where the number of clients varies. Specifically, a use case of medical image analysis is proposed, using chest X-ray images obtained from an open data repository. In addition to the advantages related to privacy, improvements in predictions (in terms of accuracy and area under the curve) and reduction of execution times will be studied with respect to the classical case (the centralized approach). Different clients will be simulated from the training data, selected in an unbalanced manner, i.e., they do not all have the same number of data. The results of considering three or ten clients are exposed and compared between them and against the centralized case. Two approaches to follow will be analyzed in the case of intermittent clients, as in a real scenario some clients may leave the training, and some new ones may enter the training. The evolution of the results for the test set in terms of accuracy, area under the curve and execution time is shown as the number of clients into which the original data is divided increases. Finally, improvements and future work in the field are proposed.      
### 122.Neural Distributed Image Compression with Cross-Attention Feature Alignment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08489.pdf)
>  We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture for compressing an image when a correlated image is available as side information only at the decoder side, a special case of the well-known and heavily studied distributed source coding (DSC) problem. In particular, we consider a pair of stereo images, which have overlapping fields of view, captured by a synchronized and calibrated pair of cameras; and therefore, are highly correlated. We assume that one image of the pair is to be compressed and transmitted, while the other image is available only at the decoder. In the proposed architecture, the encoder maps the input image to a latent space using a DNN, quantizes the latent representation, and compresses it losslessly using entropy coding. The proposed decoder extracts useful information common between the images solely from the available side information, as well as a latent representation of the side information. Then, the latent representations of the two images, one received from the encoder, the other extracted locally, along with the locally generated common information, are fed to the respective decoders of the two images. We employ a cross-attention module (CAM) to align the feature maps obtained in the intermediate layers of the respective decoders of the two images, thus allowing better utilization of the side information. We train and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on various realistic setups, such as KITTI and Cityscape datasets of stereo image pairs. Our results show that the proposed architecture is capable of exploiting the decoder-only side information in a more efficient manner as it outperforms previous works. We also show that the proposed method is able to provide significant gains even in the case of uncalibrated and unsynchronized camera array use cases.

>  Automated segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) is an essential step in neuroimaging analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR-weighted) is an MRI contrast that is particularly useful to visualize and quantify WMHs, a hallmark of cerebral small vessel disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical MRI protocols migrate to a three-dimensional (3D) FLAIR-weighted acquisition to enable high spatial resolution in all three voxel dimensions. The current study details the deployment of deep learning tools to enable automated WMH segmentation and characterization from 3D FLAIR-weighted images acquired as part of a national AD imaging initiative. <br>Among 642 participants (283 male, mean age: (65.18 +/- 9.33) years) from the DDI study, two in-house networks were trained and validated across five national collection sites. Three models were tested on a held-out subset of the internal data from the 642 participants and an external dataset with 29 cases from an international collaborator. These test sets were evaluated independently. Five established WMH performance metrics were used for comparison against ground truth human-in-the-loop segmentation. <br>Results of the three networks tested, the 3D nnU-Net had the best performance with an average dice similarity coefficient score of 0.78 +/- 0.10, performing better than both the in-house developed 2.5D model and the SOTA Deep Bayesian network. <br>With the increasing use of 3D FLAIR-weighted images in MRI protocols, our results suggest that WMH segmentation models can be trained on 3D data and yield WMH segmentation performance that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art without the need for including T1-weighted image series.      
### 124.Multi-head Cascaded Swin Transformers with Attention to k-space Sampling Pattern for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08412.pdf)
>  Global correlations are widely seen in human anatomical structures due to similarity across tissues and bones. These correlations are reflected in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as a result of close-range proton density and T1/T2 parameter. Furthermore, to achieve accelerated MRI, k-space data are undersampled which causes global aliasing artifacts. Convolutional neural network (CNN) models are widely utilized for accelerated MRI reconstruction, but those models are limited in capturing global correlations due to the intrinsic locality of the convolution operation. The self-attention-based transformer models are capable of capturing global correlations among image features, however, the current contributions of transformer models for MRI reconstruction are minute. The existing contributions mostly provide CNN-transformer hybrid solutions and rarely leverage the physics of MRI. In this paper, we propose a physics-based stand-alone (convolution free) transformer model titled, the Multi-head Cascaded Swin Transformers (McSTRA) for accelerated MRI reconstruction. McSTRA combines several interconnected MRI physics-related concepts with the transformer networks: it exploits global MR features via the shifted window self-attention mechanism; it extracts MR features belonging to different spectral components separately using a multi-head setup; it iterates between intermediate de-aliasing and k-space correction via a cascaded network with data consistency in k-space and intermediate loss computations; furthermore, we propose a novel positional embedding generation mechanism to guide self-attention utilizing the point spread function corresponding to the undersampling mask. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods both visually and quantitatively while depicting improved resolution and removal of aliasing artifacts.      
### 125.GLEAM: Greedy Learning for Large-Scale Accelerated MRI Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08393.pdf)
>  Unrolled neural networks have recently achieved state-of-the-art accelerated MRI reconstruction. These networks unroll iterative optimization algorithms by alternating between physics-based consistency and neural-network based regularization. However, they require several iterations of a large neural network to handle high-dimensional imaging tasks such as 3D MRI. This limits traditional training algorithms based on backpropagation due to prohibitively large memory and compute requirements for calculating gradients and storing intermediate activations. To address this challenge, we propose Greedy LEarning for Accelerated MRI (GLEAM) reconstruction, an efficient training strategy for high-dimensional imaging settings. GLEAM splits the end-to-end network into decoupled network modules. Each module is optimized in a greedy manner with decoupled gradient updates, reducing the memory footprint during training. We show that the decoupled gradient updates can be performed in parallel on multiple graphical processing units (GPUs) to further reduce training time. We present experiments with 2D and 3D datasets including multi-coil knee, brain, and dynamic cardiac cine MRI. We observe that: i) GLEAM generalizes as well as state-of-the-art memory-efficient baselines such as gradient checkpointing and invertible networks with the same memory footprint, but with 1.3x faster training; ii) for the same memory footprint, GLEAM yields 1.1dB PSNR gain in 2D and 1.8 dB in 3D over end-to-end baselines.      
### 126.Towards Understanding The Semidefinite Relaxations of Truncated Least-Squares in Robust Rotation Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08350.pdf)
>  The rotation search problem aims to find a 3D rotation that best aligns a given number of point pairs. To induce robustness against outliers for rotation search, prior work considers truncated least-squares (TLS), which is a non-convex optimization problem, and its semidefinite relaxation (SDR) as a tractable alternative. Whether this SDR is theoretically tight in the presence of noise, outliers, or both has remained largely unexplored. We derive conditions that characterize the tightness of this SDR, showing that the tightness depends on the noise level, the truncation parameters of TLS, and the outlier distribution (random or clustered). In particular, we give a short proof for the tightness in the noiseless and outlier-free case, as opposed to the lengthy analysis of prior work.      
### 127.PlaneSDF-based Change Detection for Long-term Dense Mapping  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08323.pdf)
>  The ability to process environment maps across multiple sessions is critical for robots operating over extended periods of time. Specifically, it is desirable for autonomous agents to detect changes amongst maps of different sessions so as to gain a conflict-free understanding of the current environment. In this paper, we look into the problem of change detection based on a novel map representation, dubbed Plane Signed Distance Fields (PlaneSDF), where dense maps are represented as a collection of planes and their associated geometric components in SDF volumes. Given point clouds of the source and target scenes, we propose a three-step PlaneSDF-based change detection approach: (1) PlaneSDF volumes are instantiated within each scene and registered across scenes using plane poses; 2D height maps and object maps are extracted per volume via height projection and connected component analysis. (2) Height maps are compared and intersected with the object map to produce a 2D change location mask for changed object candidates in the source scene. (3) 3D geometric validation is performed using SDF-derived features per object candidate for change mask refinement. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via the task of changed object detection.      
### 128.HyperInvariances: Amortizing Invariance Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08304.pdf)
>  Providing invariances in a given learning task conveys a key inductive bias that can lead to sample-efficient learning and good generalisation, if correctly specified. However, the ideal invariances for many problems of interest are often not known, which has led both to a body of engineering lore as well as attempts to provide frameworks for invariance learning. However, invariance learning is expensive and data intensive for popular neural architectures. We introduce the notion of amortizing invariance learning. In an up-front learning phase, we learn a low-dimensional manifold of feature extractors spanning invariance to different transformations using a hyper-network. Then, for any problem of interest, both model and invariance learning are rapid and efficient by fitting a low-dimensional invariance descriptor an output head. Empirically, this framework can identify appropriate invariances in different downstream tasks and lead to comparable or better test performance than conventional approaches. Our HyperInvariance framework is also theoretically appealing as it enables generalisation-bounds that provide an interesting new operating point in the trade-off between model fit and complexity.      
### 129.MLP-GAN for Brain Vessel Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08265.pdf)
>  Brain vessel image segmentation can be used as a promising biomarker for better prevention and treatment of different diseases. One successful approach is to consider the segmentation as an image-to-image translation task and perform a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to learn a transformation between two distributions. In this paper, we present a novel multi-view approach, MLP-GAN, which splits a 3D volumetric brain vessel image into three different dimensional 2D images (i.e., sagittal, coronal, axial) and then feed them into three different 2D cGANs. The proposed MLP-GAN not only alleviates the memory issue which exists in the original 3D neural networks but also retains 3D spatial information. Specifically, we utilize U-Net as the backbone for our generator and redesign the pattern of skip connection integrated with the MLP-Mixer which has attracted lots of attention recently. Our model obtains the ability to capture cross-patch information to learn global information with the MLP-Mixer. Extensive experiments are performed on the public brain vessel dataset that show our MLP-GAN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

### 130.Unsupervised Medical Image Translation with Adversarial Diffusion Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08208.pdf)
>  Imputation of missing images via source-to-target modality translation can facilitate downstream tasks in medical imaging. A pervasive approach for synthesizing target images involves one-shot mapping through generative adversarial networks (GAN). Yet, GAN models that implicitly characterize the image distribution can suffer from limited sample fidelity and diversity. Here, we propose a novel method based on adversarial diffusion modeling, SynDiff, for improved reliability in medical image synthesis. To capture a direct correlate of the image distribution, SynDiff leverages a conditional diffusion process to progressively map noise and source images onto the target image. For fast and accurate image sampling during inference, large diffusion steps are coupled with adversarial projections in the reverse diffusion direction. To enable training on unpaired datasets, a cycle-consistent architecture is devised with two coupled diffusion processes to synthesize the target given source and the source given target. Extensive assessments are reported on the utility of SynDiff against competing GAN and diffusion models in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT translation. Our demonstrations indicate that SynDiff offers superior performance against competing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively.      
### 131.BusyBot: Learning to Interact, Reason, and Plan in a BusyBoard Environment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08192.pdf)
>  We introduce BusyBoard, a toy-inspired robot learning environment that leverages a diverse set of articulated objects and inter-object functional relations to provide rich visual feedback for robot interactions. Based on this environment, we introduce a learning framework, BusyBot, which allows an agent to jointly acquire three fundamental capabilities (interaction, reasoning, and planning) in an integrated and self-supervised manner. With the rich sensory feedback provided by BusyBoard, BusyBot first learns a policy to efficiently interact with the environment; then with data collected using the policy, BusyBot reasons the inter-object functional relations through a causal discovery network; and finally by combining the learned interaction policy and relation reasoning skill, the agent is able to perform goal-conditioned manipulation tasks. We evaluate BusyBot in both simulated and real-world environments, and validate its generalizability to unseen objects and relations.

### 132.Improving Deep Neural Network Random Initialization Through Neuronal Rewiring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08148.pdf)
>  The deep learning literature is continuously updated with new architectures and training techniques. However, weight initialization is overlooked by most recent research, despite some intriguing findings regarding random weights. On the other hand, recent works have been approaching Network Science to understand the structure and dynamics of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) after training. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the centrality of neurons in randomly initialized networks. We show that a higher neuronal strength variance may decrease performance, while a lower neuronal strength variance usually improves it. A new method is then proposed to rewire neuronal connections according to a preferential attachment (PA) rule based on their strength, which significantly reduces the strength variance of layers initialized by common methods. In this sense, PA rewiring only reorganizes connections, while preserving the magnitude and distribution of the weights. We show through an extensive statistical analysis in image classification that performance is improved in most cases, both during training and testing, when using both simple and complex architectures and learning schedules. Our results show that, aside from the magnitude, the organization of the weights is also relevant for better initialization of deep ANNs.      
### 133.FloLPIPS: A Bespoke Video Quality Metric for Frame Interpoation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08119.pdf)
>  Video frame interpolation (VFI) serves as a useful tool for many video processing applications. Recently, it has also been applied in the video compression domain for enhancing both conventional video codecs and learning-based compression architectures. While there has been an increased focus on the development of enhanced frame interpolation algorithms in recent years, the perceptual quality assessment of interpolated content remains an open field of research. In this paper, we present a bespoke full reference video quality metric for VFI, FloLPIPS, that builds on the popular perceptual image quality metric, LPIPS, which captures the perceptual degradation in extracted image feature space. In order to enhance the performance of LPIPS for evaluating interpolated content, we re-designed its spatial feature aggregation step by using the temporal distortion (through comparing optical flows) to weight the feature difference maps. Evaluated on the BVI-VFI database, which contains 180 test sequences with various frame interpolation artefacts, FloLPIPS shows superior correlation performance (with statistical significance) with subjective ground truth over 12 popular quality assessors. To facilitate further research in VFI quality assessment, our code is publicly available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://danielism97.github.io/FloLPIPS" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 134.BCS-Net: Boundary, Context and Semantic for Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08114.pdf)
>  The spread of COVID-19 has brought a huge disaster to the world, and the automatic segmentation of infection regions can help doctors to make diagnosis quickly and reduce workload. However, there are several challenges for the accurate and complete segmentation, such as the scattered infection area distribution, complex background noises, and blurred segmentation boundaries. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel network for automatic COVID-19 lung infection segmentation from CT images, named BCS-Net, which considers the boundary, context, and semantic attributes. The BCS-Net follows an encoder-decoder architecture, and more designs focus on the decoder stage that includes three progressively Boundary-Context-Semantic Reconstruction (BCSR) blocks. In each BCSR block, the attention-guided global context (AGGC) module is designed to learn the most valuable encoder features for decoder by highlighting the important spatial and boundary locations and modeling the global context dependence. Besides, a semantic guidance (SG) unit generates the semantic guidance map to refine the decoder features by aggregating multi-scale high-level features at the intermediate resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing competitors both qualitatively and quantitatively.      
### 135.Single MR Image Super-Resolution using Generative Adversarial Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08036.pdf)
>  Spatial resolution of medical images can be improved using super-resolution methods. Real Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) is one of the recent effective approaches utilized to produce higher resolution images, given input images of lower resolution. In this paper, we apply this method to enhance the spatial resolution of 2D MR images. In our proposed approach, we slightly modify the structure of the Real-ESRGAN to train 2D Magnetic Resonance images (MRI) taken from the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2018 dataset. The obtained results are validated qualitatively and quantitatively by computing SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure), NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) values.      
### 136.Analysis of liver cancer detection based on image processing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08032.pdf)
>  Medical imaging is the most important tool for detecting complications in the inner body of medicine. Nowadays, with the development of image processing technology as well as changing the size of photos to higher resolution images in the field of digital medical imaging, there is an efficient and accurate system for segmenting this. Real-world images that for a variety of reasons have poor heterogeneity, noise and contrast are essential. Digital image segmentation in medicine is used for diagnostic and therapeutic analysis, which is very helpful for physicians. In this study, we aim at liver cancer photographs, which aim to more accurately detect the lesion or tumor of the liver because accurate and timely detection of the tumor is very important in the survival and life of the patient.The aim of this paper is to simplify the obnoxious study problems related to the study of MR images. The liver is the second organ most generic involved by metastatic disease being liver cancer one of the prominent causes of death worldwide. Without healthy liver a person cannot survive. It is life threatening disease which is very challenging perceptible for both medical and engineering technologists. Medical image processing is used as a non-invasive method to detect tumours. The chances of survival having liver Tumor highly depends on early detection of Tumor and then classification as cancerous and noncancerous tumours. Image processing techniques for automatic detection of brain are includes pre-processing and enhancement, image segmentation, classification and volume calculation, Poly techniques have been developed for the detection of liver Tumor and different liver toM oR detection algorithms and methodologies utilized for Tumor diagnosis. Novel methodology for the detection and diagnosis of liver Tumor.      
### 137.Discriminative Kernel Convolution Network for Multi-Label Ophthalmic Disease Detection on Imbalanced Fundus Image Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07918.pdf)
>  It is feasible to recognize the presence and seriousness of eye disease by investigating the progressions in retinal biological structure. Fundus examination is a diagnostic procedure to examine the biological structure and anomaly of the eye. Ophthalmic diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cataract are the main reason for visual impairment around the world. Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR-5K) is a benchmark structured fundus image dataset utilized by researchers for multi-label multi-disease classification of fundus images. This work presents a discriminative kernel convolution network (DKCNet), which explores discriminative region-wise features without adding extra computational cost. DKCNet is composed of an attention block followed by a squeeze and excitation (SE) block. The attention block takes features from the backbone network and generates discriminative feature attention maps. The SE block takes the discriminative feature maps and improves channel interdependencies. Better performance of DKCNet is observed with InceptionResnet backbone network for multi-label classification of ODIR-5K fundus images with 96.08 AUC, 94.28 F1-score and 0.81 kappa score. The proposed method splits the common target label for an eye pair based on the diagnostic keyword. Based on these labels oversampling and undersampling is done to resolve class imbalance. To check the biasness of proposed model towards training data, the model trained on ODIR dataset is tested on three publicly available benchmark datasets. It is found to give good performance on completely unseen fundus images also.      
### 138.On the Importance of Hyperparameters and Data Augmentation for Self-Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07875.pdf)
>  Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a very active area of Deep Learning research where it is heavily used as a pre-training method for classification and other tasks. However, the rapid pace of advancements in this area comes at a price: training pipelines vary significantly across papers, which presents a potentially crucial confounding factor. Here, we show that, indeed, the choice of hyperparameters and data augmentation strategies can have a dramatic impact on performance. To shed light on these neglected factors and help maximize the power of SSL, we hyperparameterize these components and optimize them with Bayesian optimization, showing improvements across multiple datasets for the SimSiam SSL approach. Realizing the importance of data augmentations for SSL, we also introduce a new automated data augmentation algorithm, GroupAugment, which considers groups of augmentations and optimizes the sampling across groups. In contrast to algorithms designed for supervised learning, GroupAugment achieved consistently high linear evaluation accuracy across all datasets we considered. Overall, our results indicate the importance and likely underestimated role of data augmentation for SSL.      
### 139.TransGrasp: Grasp Pose Estimation of a Category of Objects by Transferring Grasps from Only One Labeled Instance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07861.pdf)
>  Grasp pose estimation is an important issue for robots to interact with the real world. However, most of existing methods require exact 3D object models available beforehand or a large amount of grasp annotations for training. To avoid these problems, we propose TransGrasp, a category-level grasp pose estimation method that predicts grasp poses of a category of objects by labeling only one object instance. Specifically, we perform grasp pose transfer across a category of objects based on their shape correspondences and propose a grasp pose refinement module to further fine-tune grasp pose of grippers so as to ensure successful grasps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on achieving high-quality grasps with the transferred grasp poses.

### 140.Generalizable Memory-driven Transformer for Multivariate Long Sequence Time-series Forecasting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07827.pdf)
>  Multivariate long sequence time-series forecasting (M-LSTF) is a practical but challenging problem. Unlike traditional timer-series forecasting tasks, M-LSTF tasks are more challenging from two aspects: 1) M-LSTF models need to learn time-series patterns both within and between multiple time features; 2) Under the rolling forecasting setting, the similarity between two consecutive training samples increases with the increasing prediction length, which makes models more prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose a generalizable memory-driven Transformer to target M-LSTF problems. Specifically, we first propose a global-level memory component to drive the forecasting procedure by integrating multiple time-series features. In addition, we adopt a progressive fashion to train our model to increase its generalizability, in which we gradually introduce Bernoulli noises to training samples. Extensive experiments have been performed on five different datasets across multiple fields. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can be seamlessly plugged into varying Transformer-based models to improve their performances up to roughly 30%. Particularly, this is the first work to specifically focus on the M-LSTF tasks to the best of our knowledge.      
### 141.ESFPNet: efficient deep learning architecture for real-time lesion segmentation in autofluorescence bronchoscopic video  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07759.pdf)
>  Lung cancer tends to be detected at an advanced stage, resulting in a high patient mortality rate. Thus, recent research has focused on early disease detection. Lung cancer generally first appears as lesions developing within the bronchial epithelium of the airway walls. Bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice for effective noninvasive bronchial lesion detection. In particular, autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) discriminates the autofluorescence properties of normal and diseased tissue, whereby lesions appear reddish brown in AFB video frames, while normal tissue appears green. Because recent studies show AFB's ability for high lesion sensitivity, it has become a potentially pivotal method during the standard bronchoscopic airway exam for early-stage lung cancer detection. Unfortunately, manual inspection of AFB video is extremely tedious and error-prone, while limited effort has been expended toward potentially more robust automatic AFB lesion detection and segmentation. We propose a real-time deep learning architecture ESFPNet for robust detection and segmentation of bronchial lesions from an AFB video stream. The architecture features an encoder structure that exploits pretrained Mix Transformer (MiT) encoders and a stage-wise feature pyramid (ESFP) decoder structure. Results from AFB videos derived from lung cancer patient airway exams indicate that our approach gives mean Dice index and IOU values of 0.782 and 0.658, respectively, while having a processing throughput of 27 frames/sec. These values are superior to results achieved by other competing architectures that use Mix transformers or CNN-based encoders. Moreover, the superior performance on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB dataset demonstrates its potential applicability to other domains.      
### 142.HOME: High-Order Mixed-Moment-based Embedding for Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07743.pdf)
>  Minimum redundancy among different elements of an embedding in a latent space is a fundamental requirement or major preference in representation learning to capture intrinsic informational structures. Current self-supervised learning methods minimize a pair-wise covariance matrix to reduce the feature redundancy and produce promising results. However, such representation features of multiple variables may contain the redundancy among more than two feature variables that cannot be minimized via the pairwise regularization. Here we propose the High-Order Mixed-Moment-based Embedding (HOME) strategy to reduce the redundancy between any sets of feature variables, which is to our best knowledge the first attempt to utilize high-order statistics/information in this context. Multivariate mutual information is minimum if and only if multiple variables are mutually independent, which suggests the necessary conditions of factorized mixed moments among multiple variables. Based on these statistical and information theoretic principles, our general HOME framework is presented for self-supervised representation learning. Our initial experiments show that a simple version in the form of a three-order HOME scheme already significantly outperforms the current two-order baseline method (i.e., Barlow Twins) in terms of the linear evaluation on representation features.      
### 143.Untrained, physics-informed neural networks for structured illumination microscopy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07705.pdf)
>  In recent years there has been great interest in using deep neural networks (DNN) for super-resolution image reconstruction including for structured illumination microscopy (SIM). While these methods have shown very promising results, they all rely on data-driven, supervised training strategies that need a large number of ground truth images, which is experimentally difficult to realize. For SIM imaging, there exists a need for a flexible, general, and open-source reconstruction method that can be readily adapted to different forms of structured illumination. We demonstrate that we can combine a deep neural network with the forward model of the structured illumination process to reconstruct sub-diffraction images without training data. The resulting physics-informed neural network (PINN) can be optimized on a single set of diffraction limited sub-images and thus doesn't require any training set. We show with simulated and experimental data that this PINN can be applied to a wide variety of SIM methods by simply changing the known illumination patterns used in the loss function and can achieve resolution improvements that match well with theoretical expectations.      
### 144.POET: Training Neural Networks on Tiny Devices with Integrated Rematerialization and Paging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07697.pdf)
>  Fine-tuning models on edge devices like mobile phones would enable privacy-preserving personalization over sensitive data. However, edge training has historically been limited to relatively small models with simple architectures because training is both memory and energy intensive. We present POET, an algorithm to enable training large neural networks on memory-scarce battery-operated edge devices. POET jointly optimizes the integrated search search spaces of rematerialization and paging, two algorithms to reduce the memory consumption of backpropagation. Given a memory budget and a run-time constraint, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for energy-optimal training. Our approach enables training significantly larger models on embedded devices while reducing energy consumption while not modifying mathematical correctness of backpropagation. We demonstrate that it is possible to fine-tune both ResNet-18 and BERT within the memory constraints of a Cortex-M class embedded device while outperforming current edge training methods in energy efficiency.

### 145.Localisation And Imaging Methods for Moving Target Ghost Imaging Radar Based On Correlation Intensity Weighting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07649.pdf)
>  Ghost imaging radar is a new system of gaze imaging radar with high detection sensitivity, super-resolution and better anti-interference performance, but the relative motion between the radar system and the target will make the target imaging deteriorate. This paper proposes to perform absolute position localisation of a single target in the field of view by weighting the correlation strength of a single frame image of rough target, and to compensate translation of the reference arm speckle according to the localisation and tracking trajectory to accumulate the rough image into a high quality image. The proposed correlation intensity weighted localization and tracking imaging method has been verified by simulation to be able to locate and image targets in the field of view well.
