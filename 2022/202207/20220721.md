### 1.Discover and Mitigate Unknown Biases with Debiasing Alternate Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10077.pdf)
>  Deep image classifiers have been found to learn biases from datasets. To mitigate the biases, most previous methods require labels of protected attributes (e.g., age, skin tone) as full-supervision, which has two limitations: 1) it is infeasible when the labels are unavailable; 2) they are incapable of mitigating unknown biases -- biases that humans do not preconceive. To resolve those problems, we propose Debiasing Alternate Networks (DebiAN), which comprises two networks -- a Discoverer and a Classifier. By training in an alternate manner, the discoverer tries to find multiple unknown biases of the classifier without any annotations of biases, and the classifier aims at unlearning the biases identified by the discoverer. While previous works evaluate debiasing results in terms of a single bias, we create Multi-Color MNIST dataset to better benchmark mitigation of multiple biases in a multi-bias setting, which not only reveals the problems in previous methods but also demonstrates the advantage of DebiAN in identifying and mitigating multiple biases simultaneously. We further conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, showing that the discoverer in DebiAN can identify unknown biases that may be hard to be found by humans. Regarding debiasing, DebiAN achieves strong bias mitigation performance.      
### 2.Is an Object-Centric Video Representation Beneficial for Transfer?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10075.pdf)
>  The objective of this work is to learn an object-centric video representation, with the aim of improving transferability to novel tasks, i.e., tasks different from the pre-training task of action classification. To this end, we introduce a new object-centric video recognition model based on a transformer architecture. The model learns a set of object-centric summary vectors for the video, and uses these vectors to fuse the visual and spatio-temporal trajectory `modalities' of the video clip. We also introduce a novel trajectory contrast loss to further enhance objectness in these summary vectors. With experiments on four datasets -- SomethingSomething-V2, SomethingElse, Action Genome and EpicKitchens -- we show that the object-centric model outperforms prior video representations (both object-agnostic and object-aware), when: (1) classifying actions on unseen objects and unseen environments; (2) low-shot learning to novel classes; (3) linear probe to other downstream tasks; as well as (4) for standard action classification.      
### 3.Semantic uncertainty intervals for disentangled latent spaces  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10074.pdf)
>  Meaningful uncertainty quantification in computer vision requires reasoning about semantic information -- say, the hair color of the person in a photo or the location of a car on the street. To this end, recent breakthroughs in generative modeling allow us to represent semantic information in disentangled latent spaces, but providing uncertainties on the semantic latent variables has remained challenging. In this work, we provide principled uncertainty intervals that are guaranteed to contain the true semantic factors for any underlying generative model. The method does the following: (1) it uses quantile regression to output a heuristic uncertainty interval for each element in the latent space (2) calibrates these uncertainties such that they contain the true value of the latent for a new, unseen input. The endpoints of these calibrated intervals can then be propagated through the generator to produce interpretable uncertainty visualizations for each semantic factor. This technique reliably communicates semantically meaningful, principled, and instance-adaptive uncertainty in inverse problems like image super-resolution and image completion.      
### 4.Monocular 3D Object Reconstruction with GAN Inversion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10061.pdf)
>  Recovering a textured 3D mesh from a monocular image is highly challenging, particularly for in-the-wild objects that lack 3D ground truths. In this work, we present MeshInversion, a novel framework to improve the reconstruction by exploiting the generative prior of a 3D GAN pre-trained for 3D textured mesh synthesis. Reconstruction is achieved by searching for a latent space in the 3D GAN that best resembles the target mesh in accordance with the single view observation. Since the pre-trained GAN encapsulates rich 3D semantics in terms of mesh geometry and texture, searching within the GAN manifold thus naturally regularizes the realness and fidelity of the reconstruction. Importantly, such regularization is directly applied in the 3D space, providing crucial guidance of mesh parts that are unobserved in the 2D space. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our framework obtains faithful 3D reconstructions with consistent geometry and texture across both observed and unobserved parts. Moreover, it generalizes well to meshes that are less commonly seen, such as the extended articulation of deformable objects.

### 5.3D Clothed Human Reconstruction in the Wild  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10053.pdf)
>  Although much progress has been made in 3D clothed human reconstruction, most of the existing methods fail to produce robust results from in-the-wild images, which contain diverse human poses and appearances. This is mainly due to the large domain gap between training datasets and in-the-wild datasets. The training datasets are usually synthetic ones, which contain rendered images from GT 3D scans. However, such datasets contain simple human poses and less natural image appearances compared to those of real in-the-wild datasets, which makes generalization of it to in-the-wild images extremely challenging. To resolve this issue, in this work, we propose ClothWild, a 3D clothed human reconstruction framework that firstly addresses the robustness on in-thewild images. First, for the robustness to the domain gap, we propose a weakly supervised pipeline that is trainable with 2D supervision targets of in-the-wild datasets. Second, we design a DensePose-based loss function to reduce ambiguities of the weak supervision. Extensive empirical tests on several public in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that our proposed ClothWild produces much more accurate and robust results than the state-of-the-art methods.

### 6.Pretraining a Neural Network before Knowing Its Architecture  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10049.pdf)
>  Training large neural networks is possible by training a smaller hypernetwork that predicts parameters for the large ones. A recently released Graph HyperNetwork (GHN) trained this way on one million smaller ImageNet architectures is able to predict parameters for large unseen networks such as ResNet-50. While networks with predicted parameters lose performance on the source task, the predicted parameters have been found useful for fine-tuning on other tasks. We study if fine-tuning based on the same GHN is still useful on novel strong architectures that were published after the GHN had been trained. We found that for recent architectures such as ConvNeXt, GHN initialization becomes less useful than for ResNet-50. One potential reason is the increased distribution shift of novel architectures from those used to train the GHN. We also found that the predicted parameters lack the diversity necessary to successfully fine-tune parameters with gradient descent. We alleviate this limitation by applying simple post-processing techniques to predicted parameters before fine-tuning them on a target task and improve fine-tuning of ResNet-50 and ConvNeXt.      
### 7.Densely Constrained Depth Estimator for Monocular 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10047.pdf)
>  Estimating accurate 3D locations of objects from monocular images is a challenging problem because of lacking depth. Previous work shows that utilizing the object's keypoint projection constraints to estimate multiple depth candidates boosts the detection performance. However, the existing methods can only utilize vertical edges as projection constraints for depth estimation. So these methods only use a small number of projection constraints and produce insufficient depth candidates, leading to inaccurate depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a method that utilizes dense projection constraints from edges of any direction. In this way, we employ much more projection constraints and produce considerable depth candidates. Besides, we present a graph matching weighting module to merge the depth candidates. The proposed method DCD (Densely Constrained Detector) achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI and WOD benchmarks.

### 8.Fully Sparse 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10035.pdf)
>  As the perception range of LiDAR increases, LiDAR-based 3D object detection becomes a dominant task in the long-range perception task of autonomous driving. The mainstream 3D object detectors usually build dense feature maps in the network backbone and prediction head. However, the computational and spatial costs on the dense feature map are quadratic to the perception range, which makes them hardly scale up to the long-range setting. To enable efficient long-range LiDAR-based object detection, we build a fully sparse 3D object detector (FSD). The computational and spatial cost of FSD is roughly linear to the number of points and independent of the perception range. FSD is built upon the general sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR) module. SIR first groups the points into instances and then applies instance-wise feature extraction and prediction. In this way, SIR resolves the issue of center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully sparse architecture for all center-based or anchor-based detectors. Moreover, SIR avoids the time-consuming neighbor queries in previous point-based methods by grouping points into instances. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset to reveal the working mechanism of FSD, and state-of-the-art performance is reported. To demonstrate the superiority of FSD in long-range detection, we also conduct experiments on Argoverse 2 Dataset, which has a much larger perception range ($200m$) than Waymo Open Dataset ($75m$). On such a large perception range, FSD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is 2.4$\times$ faster than the dense counterpart.Codes will be released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/TuSimple/SST" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 9.MOTCOM: The Multi-Object Tracking Dataset Complexity Metric  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10031.pdf)
>  There exists no comprehensive metric for describing the complexity of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) sequences. This lack of metrics decreases explainability, complicates comparison of datasets, and reduces the conversation on tracker performance to a matter of leader board position. As a remedy, we present the novel MOT dataset complexity metric (MOTCOM), which is a combination of three sub-metrics inspired by key problems in MOT: occlusion, erratic motion, and visual similarity. The insights of MOTCOM can open nuanced discussions on tracker performance and may lead to a wider acknowledgement of novel contributions developed for either less known datasets or those aimed at solving sub-problems. We evaluate MOTCOM on the comprehensive MOT17, MOT20, and MOTSynth datasets and show that MOTCOM is far better at describing the complexity of MOT sequences compared to the conventional density and number of tracks.

### 10.Locality Guidance for Improving Vision Transformers on Tiny Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10026.pdf)
>  While the Vision Transformer (VT) architecture is becoming trendy in computer vision, pure VT models perform poorly on tiny datasets. To address this issue, this paper proposes the locality guidance for improving the performance of VTs on tiny datasets. We first analyze that the local information, which is of great importance for understanding images, is hard to be learned with limited data due to the high flexibility and intrinsic globality of the self-attention mechanism in VTs. To facilitate local information, we realize the locality guidance for VTs by imitating the features of an already trained convolutional neural network (CNN), inspired by the built-in local-to-global hierarchy of CNN. Under our dual-task learning paradigm, the locality guidance provided by a lightweight CNN trained on low-resolution images is adequate to accelerate the convergence and improve the performance of VTs to a large extent. Therefore, our locality guidance approach is very simple and efficient, and can serve as a basic performance enhancement method for VTs on tiny datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve VTs when training from scratch on tiny datasets and is compatible with different kinds of VTs and datasets. For example, our proposed method can boost the performance of various VTs on tiny datasets (e.g., 13.07% for DeiT, 8.98% for T2T and 7.85% for PVT), and enhance even stronger baseline PVTv2 by 1.86% to 79.30%, showing the potential of VTs on tiny datasets.

### 11.Learning from Synthetic Data: Facial Expression Classification based on Ensemble of Multi-task Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10025.pdf)
>  Facial expression in-the-wild is essential for various interactive computing domains. Especially, "Learning from Synthetic Data" (LSD) is an important topic in the facial expression recognition task. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning-based facial expression recognition approach which consists of emotion and appearance learning branches that can share all face information, and present preliminary results for the LSD challenge introduced in the 4th affective behavior analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition. Our method achieved the mean F1 score of 0.71.      
### 12.Difficulty-Aware Simulator for Open Set Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10024.pdf)
>  Open set recognition (OSR) assumes unknown instances appear out of the blue at the inference time. The main challenge of OSR is that the response of models for unknowns is totally unpredictable. Furthermore, the diversity of open set makes it harder since instances have different difficulty levels. Therefore, we present a novel framework, DIfficulty-Aware Simulator (DIAS), that generates fakes with diverse difficulty levels to simulate the real world. We first investigate fakes from generative adversarial network (GAN) in the classifier's viewpoint and observe that these are not severely challenging. This leads us to define the criteria for difficulty by regarding samples generated with GANs having moderate-difficulty. To produce hard-difficulty examples, we introduce Copycat, imitating the behavior of the classifier. Furthermore, moderate- and easy-difficulty samples are also yielded by our modified GAN and Copycat, respectively. As a result, DIAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with both metrics of AUROC and F-score.

### 13.Tailoring Self-Supervision for Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10023.pdf)
>  Recently, it is shown that deploying a proper self-supervision is a prospective way to enhance the performance of supervised learning. Yet, the benefits of self-supervision are not fully exploited as previous pretext tasks are specialized for unsupervised representation learning. To this end, we begin by presenting three desirable properties for such auxiliary tasks to assist the supervised objective. First, the tasks need to guide the model to learn rich features. Second, the transformations involved in the self-supervision should not significantly alter the training distribution. Third, the tasks are preferred to be light and generic for high applicability to prior arts. Subsequently, to show how existing pretext tasks can fulfill these and be tailored for supervised learning, we propose a simple auxiliary self-supervision task, predicting localizable rotation (LoRot). Our exhaustive experiments validate the merits of LoRot as a pretext task tailored for supervised learning in terms of robustness and generalization capability.

### 14.Secrets of Event-Based Optical Flow  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10022.pdf)
>  Event cameras respond to scene dynamics and offer advantages to estimate motion. Following recent image-based deep-learning achievements, optical flow estimation methods for event cameras have rushed to combine those image-based methods with event data. However, it requires several adaptations (data conversion, loss function, etc.) as they have very different properties. We develop a principled method to extend the Contrast Maximization framework to estimate optical flow from events alone. We investigate key elements: how to design the objective function to prevent overfitting, how to warp events to deal better with occlusions, and how to improve convergence with multi-scale raw events. With these key elements, our method ranks first among unsupervised methods on the MVSEC benchmark, and is competitive on the DSEC benchmark. Moreover, our method allows us to expose the issues of the ground truth flow in those benchmarks, and produces remarkable results when it is transferred to unsupervised learning settings.

### 15.Generative Domain Adaptation for Face Anti-Spoofing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10015.pdf)
>  Face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches based on unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) have drawn growing attention due to promising performances for target scenarios. Most existing UDA FAS methods typically fit the trained models to the target domain via aligning the distribution of semantic high-level features. However, insufficient supervision of unlabeled target domains and neglect of low-level feature alignment degrade the performances of existing methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel perspective of UDA FAS that directly fits the target data to the models, i.e., stylizes the target data to the source-domain style via image translation, and further feeds the stylized data into the well-trained source model for classification. The proposed Generative Domain Adaptation (GDA) framework combines two carefully designed consistency constraints: 1) Inter-domain neural statistic consistency guides the generator in narrowing the inter-domain gap. 2) Dual-level semantic consistency ensures the semantic quality of stylized images. Besides, we propose intra-domain spectrum mixup to further expand target data distributions to ensure generalization and reduce the intra-domain gap. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 16.E-Graph: Minimal Solution for Rigid Rotation with Extensibility Graphs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10008.pdf)
>  Minimal solutions for relative rotation and translation estimation tasks have been explored in different scenarios, typically relying on the so-called co-visibility graph. However, how to build direct rotation relationships between two frames without overlap is still an open topic, which, if solved, could greatly improve the accuracy of visual odometry. <br>In this paper, a new minimal solution is proposed to solve relative rotation estimation between two images without overlapping areas by exploiting a new graph structure, which we call Extensibility Graph (E-Graph). Differently from a co-visibility graph, high-level landmarks, including vanishing directions and plane normals, are stored in our E-Graph, which are geometrically extensible. Based on E-Graph, the rotation estimation problem becomes simpler and more elegant, as it can deal with pure rotational motion and requires fewer assumptions, e.g. Manhattan/Atlanta World, planar/vertical motion. Finally, we embed our rotation estimation strategy into a complete camera tracking and mapping system which obtains 6-DoF camera poses and a dense 3D mesh model. <br>Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance.      
### 17.Overcoming Shortcut Learning in a Target Domain by Generalizing Basic Visual Factors from a Source Domain  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10002.pdf)
>  Shortcut learning occurs when a deep neural network overly relies on spurious correlations in the training dataset in order to solve downstream tasks. Prior works have shown how this impairs the compositional generalization capability of deep learning models. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to mitigate shortcut learning in uncontrolled target domains. Our approach extends the training set with an additional dataset (the source domain), which is specifically designed to facilitate learning independent representations of basic visual factors. We benchmark our idea on synthetic target domains where we explicitly control shortcut opportunities as well as real-world target domains. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of different specifications of the source domain and the network architecture on compositional generalization. Our main finding is that leveraging data from a source domain is an effective way to mitigate shortcut learning. By promoting independence across different factors of variation in the learned representations, networks can learn to consider only predictive factors and ignore potential shortcut factors during inference.      
### 18.DecoupleNet: Decoupled Network for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09988.pdf)
>  Unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation has been raised to alleviate the reliance on expensive pixel-wise annotations. It leverages a labeled source domain dataset as well as unlabeled target domain images to learn a segmentation network. In this paper, we observe two main issues of the existing domain-invariant learning framework. (1) Being distracted by the feature distribution alignment, the network cannot focus on the segmentation task. (2) Fitting source domain data well would compromise the target domain performance. To address these issues, we propose DecoupleNet that alleviates source domain overfitting and enables the final model to focus more on the segmentation task. Furthermore, we put forward Self-Discrimination (SD) and introduce an auxiliary classifier to learn more discriminative target domain features with pseudo labels. Finally, we propose Online Enhanced Self-Training (OEST) to contextually enhance the quality of pseudo labels in an online manner. Experiments show our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, and extensive ablation studies verify the effectiveness of each component.

### 19.NeuralBF: Neural Bilateral Filtering for Top-down Instance Segmentation on Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09978.pdf)
>  We introduce a method for instance proposal generation for 3D point clouds. Existing techniques typically directly regress proposals in a single feed-forward step, leading to inaccurate estimation. We show that this serves as a critical bottleneck, and propose a method based on iterative bilateral filtering with learned kernels. Following the spirit of bilateral filtering, we consider both the deep feature embeddings of each point, as well as their locations in the 3D space. We show via synthetic experiments that our method brings drastic improvements when generating instance proposals for a given point of interest. We further validate our method on the challenging ScanNet benchmark, achieving the best instance segmentation performance amongst the sub-category of top-down methods.      
### 20.Temporal and cross-modal attention for audio-visual zero-shot learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09966.pdf)
>  Audio-visual generalised zero-shot learning for video classification requires understanding the relations between the audio and visual information in order to be able to recognise samples from novel, previously unseen classes at test time. The natural semantic and temporal alignment between audio and visual data in video data can be exploited to learn powerful representations that generalise to unseen classes at test time. We propose a multi-modal and Temporal Cross-attention Framework (\modelName) for audio-visual generalised zero-shot learning. Its inputs are temporally aligned audio and visual features that are obtained from pre-trained networks. Encouraging the framework to focus on cross-modal correspondence across time instead of self-attention within the modalities boosts the performance significantly. We show that our proposed framework that ingests temporal features yields state-of-the-art performance on the \ucf, \vgg, and \activity benchmarks for (generalised) zero-shot learning. Code for reproducing all results is available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/ExplainableML/TCAF-GZSL" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 21.M2-Net: Multi-stages Specular Highlight Detection and Removal in Multi-scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09965.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel uniformity framework for highlight detection and removal in multi-scenes, including synthetic images, face images, natural images, and text images. The framework consists of three main components, highlight feature extractor module, highlight coarse removal module, and highlight refine removal module. Firstly, the highlight feature extractor module can directly separate the highlight feature and non-highlight feature from the original highlight image. Then highlight removal image is obtained using a coarse highlight removal network. To further improve the highlight removal effect, the refined highlight removal image is finally obtained using refine highlight removal module based on contextual highlight attention mechanisms. Extensive experimental results in multiple scenes indicate that the proposed framework can obtain excellent visual effects of highlight removal and achieve state-of-the-art results in several quantitative evaluation metrics. Our algorithm is applied for the first time in video highlight removal with promising results.      
### 22.Rethinking Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning with Open-Set Hypothesis in Hyperbolic Geometry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09963.pdf)
>  Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims at incrementally learning novel classes from a few labeled samples by avoiding the overfitting and catastrophic forgetting simultaneously. The current protocol of FSCIL is built by mimicking the general class-incremental learning setting, while it is not totally appropriate due to the different data configuration, i.e., novel classes are all in the limited data regime. In this paper, we rethink the configuration of FSCIL with the open-set hypothesis by reserving the possibility in the first session for incoming categories. To assign better performances on both close-set and open-set recognition to the model, Hyperbolic Reciprocal Point Learning module (Hyper-RPL) is built on Reciprocal Point Learning (RPL) with hyperbolic neural networks. Besides, for learning novel categories from limited labeled data, we incorporate a hyperbolic metric learning (Hyper-Metric) module into the distillation-based framework to alleviate the overfitting issue and better handle the trade-off issue between the preservation of old knowledge and the acquisition of new knowledge. The comprehensive assessments of the proposed configuration and modules on three benchmark datasets are executed to validate the effectiveness concerning three evaluation indicators.      
### 23.Estimating Model Performance under Domain Shifts with Class-Specific Confidence Scores  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09957.pdf)
>  Machine learning models are typically deployed in a test setting that differs from the training setting, potentially leading to decreased model performance because of domain shift. If we could estimate the performance that a pre-trained model would achieve on data from a specific deployment setting, for example a certain clinic, we could judge whether the model could safely be deployed or if its performance degrades unacceptably on the specific data. Existing approaches estimate this based on the confidence of predictions made on unlabeled test data from the deployment's domain. We find existing methods struggle with data that present class imbalance, because the methods used to calibrate confidence do not account for bias induced by class imbalance, consequently failing to estimate class-wise accuracy. Here, we introduce class-wise calibration within the framework of performance estimation for imbalanced datasets. Specifically, we derive class-specific modifications of state-of-the-art confidence-based model evaluation methods including temperature scaling (TS), difference of confidences (DoC), and average thresholded confidence (ATC). We also extend the methods to estimate Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in image segmentation. We conduct experiments on four tasks and find the proposed modifications consistently improve the estimation accuracy for imbalanced datasets. Our methods improve accuracy estimation by 18\% in classification under natural domain shifts, and double the estimation accuracy on segmentation tasks, when compared with prior methods.      
### 24.Telepresence Video Quality Assessment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09956.pdf)
>  Video conferencing, which includes both video and audio content, has contributed to dramatic increases in Internet traffic, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of people to work and learn from home. Global Internet traffic of video conferencing has dramatically increased Because of this, efficient and accurate video quality tools are needed to monitor and perceptually optimize telepresence traffic streamed via Zoom, Webex, Meet, etc. However, existing models are limited in their prediction capabilities on multi-modal, live streaming telepresence content. Here we address the significant challenges of Telepresence Video Quality Assessment (TVQA) in several ways. First, we mitigated the dearth of subjectively labeled data by collecting ~2k telepresence videos from different countries, on which we crowdsourced ~80k subjective quality labels. Using this new resource, we created a first-of-a-kind online video quality prediction framework for live streaming, using a multi-modal learning framework with separate pathways to compute visual and audio quality predictions. Our all-in-one model is able to provide accurate quality predictions at the patch, frame, clip, and audiovisual levels. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing quality databases and our new TVQA database, at a considerably lower computational expense, making it an attractive solution for mobile and embedded systems.      
### 25.Learning Pedestrian Group Representations for Multi-modal Trajectory Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09953.pdf)
>  Modeling the dynamics of people walking is a problem of long-standing interest in computer vision. Many previous works involving pedestrian trajectory prediction define a particular set of individual actions to implicitly model group actions. In this paper, we present a novel architecture named GP-Graph which has collective group representations for effective pedestrian trajectory prediction in crowded environments, and is compatible with all types of existing approaches. A key idea of GP-Graph is to model both individual-wise and group-wise relations as graph representations. To do this, GP-Graph first learns to assign each pedestrian into the most likely behavior group. Using this assignment information, GP-Graph then forms both intra- and inter-group interactions as graphs, accounting for human-human relations within a group and group-group relations, respectively. To be specific, for the intra-group interaction, we mask pedestrian graph edges out of an associated group. We also propose group pooling&amp;unpooling operations to represent a group with multiple pedestrians as one graph node. Lastly, GP-Graph infers a probability map for socially-acceptable future trajectories from the integrated features of both group interactions. Moreover, we introduce a group-level latent vector sampling to ensure collective inferences over a set of possible future trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our architecture, which demonstrates consistent performance improvements with publicly available benchmarks.

### 26.VirtualPose: Learning Generalizable 3D Human Pose Models from Virtual Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09949.pdf)
>  While monocular 3D pose estimation seems to have achieved very accurate results on the public datasets, their generalization ability is largely overlooked. In this work, we perform a systematic evaluation of the existing methods and find that they get notably larger errors when tested on different cameras, human poses and appearance. To address the problem, we introduce VirtualPose, a two-stage learning framework to exploit the hidden "free lunch" specific to this task, i.e. generating infinite number of poses and cameras for training models at no cost. To that end, the first stage transforms images to abstract geometry representations (AGR), and then the second maps them to 3D poses. It addresses the generalization issue from two aspects: (1) the first stage can be trained on diverse 2D datasets to reduce the risk of over-fitting to limited appearance; (2) the second stage can be trained on diverse AGR synthesized from a large number of virtual cameras and poses. It outperforms the SOTA methods without using any paired images and 3D poses from the benchmarks, which paves the way for practical applications.

### 27.Towards Efficient and Scale-Robust Ultra-High-Definition Image Demoireing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09935.pdf)
>  With the rapid development of mobile devices, modern widely-used mobile phones typically allow users to capture 4K resolution (i.e., ultra-high-definition) images. However, for image demoireing, a challenging task in low-level vision, existing works are generally carried out on low-resolution or synthetic images. Hence, the effectiveness of these methods on 4K resolution images is still unknown. In this paper, we explore moire pattern removal for ultra-high-definition images. To this end, we propose the first ultra-high-definition demoireing dataset (UHDM), which contains 5,000 real-world 4K resolution image pairs, and conduct a benchmark study on current state-of-the-art methods. Further, we present an efficient baseline model ESDNet for tackling 4K moire images, wherein we build a semantic-aligned scale-aware module to address the scale variation of moire patterns. Extensive experiments manifest the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while being much more lightweight.

### 28.Robust Landmark-based Stent Tracking in X-ray Fluoroscopy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09933.pdf)
>  In clinical procedures of angioplasty (i.e., open clogged coronary arteries), devices such as balloons and stents need to be placed and expanded in arteries under the guidance of X-ray fluoroscopy. Due to the limitation of X-ray dose, the resulting images are often noisy. To check the correct placement of these devices, typically multiple motion-compensated frames are averaged to enhance the view. Therefore, device tracking is a necessary procedure for this purpose. Even though angioplasty devices are designed to have radiopaque markers for the ease of tracking, current methods struggle to deliver satisfactory results due to the small marker size and complex scenes in angioplasty. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for single stent tracking, which consists of three hierarchical modules: U-Net based landmark detection, ResNet based stent proposal and feature extraction, and graph convolutional neural network (GCN) based stent tracking that temporally aggregates both spatial information and appearance features. The experiments show that our method performs significantly better in detection compared with the state-of-the-art point-based tracking models. In addition, its fast inference speed satisfies clinical requirements.      
### 29.ViGAT: Bottom-up event recognition and explanation in video using factorized graph attention network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09927.pdf)
>  In this paper a pure-attention bottom-up approach, called ViGAT, that utilizes an object detector together with a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone network to derive object and frame features, and a head network to process these features for the task of event recognition and explanation in video, is proposed. The ViGAT head consists of graph attention network (GAT) blocks factorized along the spatial and temporal dimensions in order to capture effectively both local and long-term dependencies between objects or frames. Moreover, using the weighted in-degrees (WiDs) derived from the adjacency matrices at the various GAT blocks, we show that the proposed architecture can identify the most salient objects and frames that explain the decision of the network. A comprehensive evaluation study is performed, demonstrating that the proposed approach provides state-of-the-art results on three large, publicly available video datasets (FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, ActivityNet).      
### 30.An Efficient Framework for Few-shot Skeleton-based Temporal Action Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09925.pdf)
>  Temporal action segmentation (TAS) aims to classify and locate actions in the long untrimmed action sequence. With the success of deep learning, many deep models for action segmentation have emerged. However, few-shot TAS is still a challenging problem. This study proposes an efficient framework for the few-shot skeleton-based TAS, including a data augmentation method and an improved model. The data augmentation approach based on motion interpolation is presented here to solve the problem of insufficient data, and can increase the number of samples significantly by synthesizing action sequences. Besides, we concatenate a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layer with a network designed for skeleton-based TAS to obtain an optimized model. Leveraging CTC can enhance the temporal alignment between prediction and ground truth and further improve the segment-wise metrics of segmentation results. Extensive experiments on both public and self-constructed datasets, including two small-scale datasets and one large-scale dataset, show the effectiveness of two proposed methods in improving the performance of the few-shot skeleton-based TAS task.      
### 31.A note on the variation of geometric functionals  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09915.pdf)
>  Calculus of Variation combined with Differential Geometry as tools of modelling and solving problems in image processing and computer vision were introduced in the late 80's and the 90s of the 20th century. The beginning of an extensive work in these directions was marked by works such as Geodesic Active Contours (GAC), the Beltrami framework, level set method of Osher and Sethian the works of Charpiat et al. and the works by Chan and Vese to name just a few. In many cases the optimization of these functional are done by the gradient descent method via the calculation of the Euler-Lagrange equations. Straightforward use of the resulted EL equations in the gradient descent scheme leads to non-geometric and in some cases non sensical equations. It is costumary to modify these EL equations or even the functional itself in order to obtain geometric and/or sensical equations. The aim of this note is to point to the correct way to derive the EL and the gradient descent equations such that the resulted gradient descent equation is geometric and makes sense.      
### 32.Labeling instructions matter in biomedical image analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09899.pdf)
>  Biomedical image analysis algorithm validation depends on high-quality annotation of reference datasets, for which labeling instructions are key. Despite their importance, their optimization remains largely unexplored. Here, we present the first systematic study of labeling instructions and their impact on annotation quality in the field. Through comprehensive examination of professional practice and international competitions registered at the MICCAI Society, we uncovered a discrepancy between annotators' needs for labeling instructions and their current quality and availability. Based on an analysis of 14,040 images annotated by 156 annotators from four professional companies and 708 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdworkers using instructions with different information density levels, we further found that including exemplary images significantly boosts annotation performance compared to text-only descriptions, while solely extending text descriptions does not. Finally, professional annotators constantly outperform MTurk crowdworkers. Our study raises awareness for the need of quality standards in biomedical image analysis labeling instructions.      
### 33.Negative Samples are at Large: Leveraging Hard-distance Elastic Loss for Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09884.pdf)
>  We present a Momentum Re-identification (MoReID) framework that can leverage a very large number of negative samples in training for general re-identification task. The design of this framework is inspired by Momentum Contrast (MoCo), which uses a dictionary to store current and past batches to build a large set of encoded samples. As we find it less effective to use past positive samples which may be highly inconsistent to the encoded feature property formed with the current positive samples, MoReID is designed to use only a large number of negative samples stored in the dictionary. However, if we train the model using the widely used Triplet loss that uses only one sample to represent a set of positive/negative samples, it is hard to effectively leverage the enlarged set of negative samples acquired by the MoReID framework. To maximize the advantage of using the scaled-up negative sample set, we newly introduce Hard-distance Elastic loss (HE loss), which is capable of using more than one hard sample to represent a large number of samples. Our experiments demonstrate that a large number of negative samples provided by MoReID framework can be utilized at full capacity only with the HE loss, achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy on three re-ID benchmarks, VeRi-776, Market-1501, and VeRi-Wild.      
### 34.A Novel Neural Network Training Method for Autonomous Driving Using Semi-Pseudo-Labels and 3D Data Augmentations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09869.pdf)
>  Training neural networks to perform 3D object detection for autonomous driving requires a large amount of diverse annotated data. However, obtaining training data with sufficient quality and quantity is expensive and sometimes impossible due to human and sensor constraints. Therefore, a novel solution is needed for extending current training methods to overcome this limitation and enable accurate 3D object detection. Our solution for the above-mentioned problem combines semi-pseudo-labeling and novel 3D augmentations. For demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method, we have designed a convolutional neural network for 3D object detection which can significantly increase the detection range in comparison with the training data distribution.      
### 35.Adaptive Mixture of Experts Learning for Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09868.pdf)
>  With various face presentation attacks emerging continually, face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches based on domain generalization (DG) have drawn growing attention. Existing DG-based FAS approaches always capture the domain-invariant features for generalizing on the various unseen domains. However, they neglect individual source domains' discriminative characteristics and diverse domain-specific information of the unseen domains, and the trained model is not sufficient to be adapted to various unseen domains. To address this issue, we propose an Adaptive Mixture of Experts Learning (AMEL) framework, which exploits the domain-specific information to adaptively establish the link among the seen source domains and unseen target domains to further improve the generalization. Concretely, Domain-Specific Experts (DSE) are designed to investigate discriminative and unique domain-specific features as a complement to common domain-invariant features. Moreover, Dynamic Expert Aggregation (DEA) is proposed to adaptively aggregate the complementary information of each source expert based on the domain relevance to the unseen target domain. And combined with meta-learning, these modules work collaboratively to adaptively aggregate meaningful domain-specific information for the various unseen target domains. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against the state-of-the-art competitors.      
### 36.Discrete-Constrained Regression for Local Counting Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09865.pdf)
>  Local counts, or the number of objects in a local area, is a continuous value by nature. Yet recent state-of-the-art methods show that formulating counting as a classification task performs better than regression. Through a series of experiments on carefully controlled synthetic data, we show that this counter-intuitive result is caused by imprecise ground truth local counts. Factors such as biased dot annotations and incorrectly matched Gaussian kernels used to generate ground truth counts introduce deviations from the true local counts. Standard continuous regression is highly sensitive to these errors, explaining the performance gap between classification and regression. To mitigate the sensitivity, we loosen the regression formulation from a continuous scale to a discrete ordering and propose a novel discrete-constrained (DC) regression. Applied to crowd counting, DC-regression is more accurate than both classification and standard regression on three public benchmarks. A similar advantage also holds for the age estimation task, verifying the overall effectiveness of DC-regression.      
### 37.Evaluating the Stability of Deep Image Quality Assessment With Respect to Image Scaling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09856.pdf)
>  Image quality assessment (IQA) is a fundamental metric for image processing tasks (e.g., compression). With full-reference IQAs, traditional IQAs, such as PSNR and SSIM, have been used. Recently, IQAs based on deep neural networks (deep IQAs), such as LPIPS and DISTS, have also been used. It is known that image scaling is inconsistent among deep IQAs, as some perform down-scaling as pre-processing, whereas others instead use the original image size. In this paper, we show that the image scale is an influential factor that affects deep IQA performance. We comprehensively evaluate four deep IQAs on the same five datasets, and the experimental results show that image scale significantly influences IQA performance. We found that the most appropriate image scale is often neither the default nor the original size, and the choice differs depending on the methods and datasets used. We visualized the stability and found that PieAPP is the most stable among the four deep IQAs.      
### 38.Everything is There in Latent Space: Attribute Editing and Attribute Style Manipulation by StyleGAN Latent Space Exploration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09855.pdf)
>  Unconstrained Image generation with high realism is now possible using recent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, it is quite challenging to generate images with a given set of attributes. Recent methods use style-based GAN models to perform image editing by leveraging the semantic hierarchy present in the layers of the generator. We present Few-shot Latent-based Attribute Manipulation and Editing (FLAME), a simple yet effective framework to perform highly controlled image editing by latent space manipulation. Specifically, we estimate linear directions in the latent space (of a pre-trained StyleGAN) that controls semantic attributes in the generated image. In contrast to previous methods that either rely on large-scale attribute labeled datasets or attribute classifiers, FLAME uses minimal supervision of a few curated image pairs to estimate disentangled edit directions. FLAME can perform both individual and sequential edits with high precision on a diverse set of images while preserving identity. Further, we propose a novel task of Attribute Style Manipulation to generate diverse styles for attributes such as eyeglass and hair. We first encode a set of synthetic images of the same identity but having different attribute styles in the latent space to estimate an attribute style manifold. Sampling a new latent from this manifold will result in a new attribute style in the generated image. We propose a novel sampling method to sample latent from the manifold, enabling us to generate a diverse set of attribute styles beyond the styles present in the training set. FLAME can generate diverse attribute styles in a disentangled manner. We illustrate the superior performance of FLAME against previous image editing methods by extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons. FLAME also generalizes well on multiple datasets such as cars and churches.      
### 39.EleGANt: Exquisite and Locally Editable GAN for Makeup Transfer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09840.pdf)
>  Most existing methods view makeup transfer as transferring color distributions of different facial regions and ignore details such as eye shadows and blushes. Besides, they only achieve controllable transfer within predefined fixed regions. This paper emphasizes the transfer of makeup details and steps towards more flexible controls. To this end, we propose Exquisite and locally editable GAN for makeup transfer (EleGANt). It encodes facial attributes into pyramidal feature maps to preserves high-frequency information. It uses attention to extract makeup features from the reference and adapt them to the source face, and we introduce a novel Sow-Attention Module that applies attention within shifted overlapped windows to reduce the computational cost. Moreover, EleGANt is the first to achieve customized local editing within arbitrary areas by corresponding editing on the feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EleGANt generates realistic makeup faces with exquisite details and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### 40.UNIF: United Neural Implicit Functions for Clothed Human Reconstruction and Animation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09835.pdf)
>  We propose united implicit functions (UNIF), a part-based method for clothed human reconstruction and animation with raw scans and skeletons as the input. Previous part-based methods for human reconstruction rely on ground-truth part labels from SMPL and thus are limited to minimal-clothed humans. In contrast, our method learns to separate parts from body motions instead of part supervision, thus can be extended to clothed humans and other articulated objects. Our Partition-from-Motion is achieved by a bone-centered initialization, a bone limit loss, and a section normal loss that ensure stable part division even when the training poses are limited. We also present a minimal perimeter loss for SDF to suppress extra surfaces and part overlapping. Another core of our method is an adjacent part seaming algorithm that produces non-rigid deformations to maintain the connection between parts which significantly relieves the part-based artifacts. Under this algorithm, we further propose "Competing Parts", a method that defines blending weights by the relative position of a point to bones instead of the absolute position, avoiding the generalization problem of neural implicit functions with inverse LBS (linear blend skinning). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by clothed human body reconstruction and animation on the CAPE and the ClothSeq datasets.      
### 41.NUWA-Infinity: Autoregressive over Autoregressive Generation for Infinite Visual Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09814.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present NUWA-Infinity, a generative model for infinite visual synthesis, which is defined as the task of generating arbitrarily-sized high-resolution images or long-duration videos. An autoregressive over autoregressive generation mechanism is proposed to deal with this variable-size generation task, where a global patch-level autoregressive model considers the dependencies between patches, and a local token-level autoregressive model considers dependencies between visual tokens within each patch. A Nearby Context Pool (NCP) is introduced to cache-related patches already generated as the context for the current patch being generated, which can significantly save computation costs without sacrificing patch-level dependency modeling. An Arbitrary Direction Controller (ADC) is used to decide suitable generation orders for different visual synthesis tasks and learn order-aware positional embeddings. Compared to DALL-E, Imagen and Parti, NUWA-Infinity can generate high-resolution images with arbitrary sizes and support long-duration video generation additionally. Compared to NUWA, which also covers images and videos, NUWA-Infinity has superior visual synthesis capabilities in terms of resolution and variable-size generation.

### 42.The Anatomy of Video Editing: A Dataset and Benchmark Suite for AI-Assisted Video Editing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09812.pdf)
>  Machine learning is transforming the video editing industry. Recent advances in computer vision have leveled-up video editing tasks such as intelligent reframing, rotoscoping, color grading, or applying digital makeups. However, most of the solutions have focused on video manipulation and VFX. This work introduces the Anatomy of Video Editing, a dataset, and benchmark, to foster research in AI-assisted video editing. Our benchmark suite focuses on video editing tasks, beyond visual effects, such as automatic footage organization and assisted video assembling. To enable research on these fronts, we annotate more than 1.5M tags, with relevant concepts to cinematography, from 196176 shots sampled from movie scenes. We establish competitive baseline methods and detailed analyses for each of the tasks. We hope our work sparks innovative research towards underexplored areas of AI-assisted video editing.      
### 43.Multimodal Transformer for Automatic 3D Annotation and Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09805.pdf)
>  Despite a growing number of datasets being collected for training 3D object detection models, significant human effort is still required to annotate 3D boxes on LiDAR scans. To automate the annotation and facilitate the production of various customized datasets, we propose an end-to-end multimodal transformer (MTrans) autolabeler, which leverages both LiDAR scans and images to generate precise 3D box annotations from weak 2D bounding boxes. To alleviate the pervasive sparsity problem that hinders existing autolabelers, MTrans densifies the sparse point clouds by generating new 3D points based on 2D image information. With a multi-task design, MTrans segments the foreground/background, densifies LiDAR point clouds, and regresses 3D boxes simultaneously. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the MTrans for improving the quality of the generated labels. By enriching the sparse point clouds, our method achieves 4.48\% and 4.03\% better 3D AP on KITTI moderate and hard samples, respectively, versus the state-of-the-art autolabeler. MTrans can also be extended to improve the accuracy for 3D object detection, resulting in a remarkable 89.45\% AP on KITTI hard samples.

### 44.EASNet: Searching Elastic and Accurate Network Architecture for Stereo Matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09796.pdf)
>  Recent advanced studies have spent considerable human efforts on optimizing network architectures for stereo matching but hardly achieved both high accuracy and fast inference speed. To ease the workload in network design, neural architecture search (NAS) has been applied with great success to various sparse prediction tasks, such as image classification and object detection. However, existing NAS studies on the dense prediction task, especially stereo matching, still cannot be efficiently and effectively deployed on devices of different computing capabilities. To this end, we propose to train an elastic and accurate network for stereo matching (EASNet) that supports various 3D architectural settings on devices with different computing capabilities. Given the deployment latency constraint on the target device, we can quickly extract a sub-network from the full EASNet without additional training while the accuracy of the sub-network can still be maintained. Extensive experiments show that our EASNet outperforms both state-of-the-art human-designed and NAS-based architectures on Scene Flow and MPI Sintel datasets in terms of model accuracy and inference speed. Particularly, deployed on an inference GPU, EASNet achieves a new SOTA 0.73 EPE on the Scene Flow dataset with 100 ms, which is 4.5$\times$ faster than LEAStereo with a better quality model.      
### 45.Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection via Pattern Generative and Contrastive Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09792.pdf)
>  It is hard to collect enough flaw images for training deep learning network in industrial production. Therefore, existing industrial anomaly detection methods prefer to use CNN-based unsupervised detection and localization network to achieve this task. However, these methods always fail when there are varieties happened in new signals since traditional end-to-end networks suffer barriers of fitting nonlinear model in high-dimensional space. Moreover, they have a memory library by clustering the feature of normal images essentially, which cause it is not robust to texture change. To this end, we propose the Vision Transformer based (VIT-based) unsupervised anomaly detection network. It utilizes a hierarchical task learning and human experience to enhance its interpretability. Our network consists of pattern generation and comparison networks. Pattern generation network uses two VIT-based encoder modules to extract the feature of two consecutive image patches, then uses VIT-based decoder module to learn the human designed style of these features and predict the third image patch. After this, we use the Siamese-based network to compute the similarity of the generation image patch and original image patch. Finally, we refine the anomaly localization by the bi-directional inference strategy. Comparison experiments on public dataset MVTec dataset show our method achieves 99.8% AUC, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we give a qualitative illustration on our own leather and cloth datasets. The accurate segment results strongly prove the accuracy of our method in anomaly detection.      
### 46.FaceFormer: Scale-aware Blind Face Restoration with Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09790.pdf)
>  Blind face restoration usually encounters with diverse scale face inputs, especially in the real world. However, most of the current works support specific scale faces, which limits its application ability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel scale-aware blind face restoration framework, named FaceFormer, which formulates facial feature restoration as scale-aware transformation. The proposed Facial Feature Up-sampling (FFUP) module dynamically generates upsampling filters based on the original scale-factor priors, which facilitate our network to adapt to arbitrary face scales. Moreover, we further propose the facial feature embedding (FFE) module which leverages transformer to hierarchically extract diversity and robustness of facial latent. Thus, our FaceFormer achieves fidelity and robustness restored faces, which possess realistic and symmetrical details of facial components. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method trained with synthetic dataset generalizes better to a natural low quality images than current state-of-the-arts.      
### 47.CoSMix: Compositional Semantic Mix for Domain Adaptation in 3D LiDAR Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09778.pdf)
>  3D LiDAR semantic segmentation is fundamental for autonomous driving. Several Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods for point cloud data have been recently proposed to improve model generalization for different sensors and environments. Researchers working on UDA problems in the image domain have shown that sample mixing can mitigate domain shift. We propose a new approach of sample mixing for point cloud UDA, namely Compositional Semantic Mix (CoSMix), the first UDA approach for point cloud segmentation based on sample mixing. CoSMix consists of a two-branch symmetric network that can process labelled synthetic data (source) and real-world unlabelled point clouds (target) concurrently. Each branch operates on one domain by mixing selected pieces of data from the other one, and by using the semantic information derived from source labels and target pseudo-labels. We evaluate CoSMix on two large-scale datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

### 48.AU-Supervised Convolutional Vision Transformers for Synthetic Facial Expression Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09777.pdf)
>  The paper describes our proposed methodology for the six basic expression classification track of Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) Competition 2022. In Learing from Synthetic Data(LSD) task, facial expression recognition (FER) methods aim to learn the representation of expression from the artificially generated data and generalise to real data. Because of the ambiguous of the synthetic data and the objectivity of the facial Action Unit (AU), we resort to the AU information for performance boosting, and make contributions as follows. First, to adapt the model to synthetic scenarios, we use the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale face recognition data. Second, we propose a conceptually-new framework, termed as AU-Supervised Convolutional Vision Transformers (AU-CVT), which clearly improves the performance of FER by jointly training auxiliary datasets with AU or pseudo AU labels. Our AU-CVT achieved F1 score as $0.6863$, accuracy as $0.7433$ on the validation set.

### 49.More Practical Scenario of Open-set Object Detection: Open at Category Level and Closed at Super-category Level  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09775.pdf)
>  Open-set object detection (OSOD) has recently attracted considerable attention. It is to detect unknown objects while correctly detecting/classifying known objects. We first point out that the scenario of OSOD considered in recent studies, which considers an unlimited variety of unknown objects similar to open-set recognition (OSR), has a fundamental issue. That is, we cannot determine what to detect and what not for such unlimited unknown objects, which is necessary for detection tasks. This issue leads to difficulty with the evaluation of methods' performance on unknown object detection. We then introduce a novel scenario of OSOD, which deals with only unknown objects that share the super-category with known objects. It has many real-world applications, e.g., detecting an increasing number of fine-grained objects. This new setting is free from the above issue and evaluation difficulty. Moreover, it makes detecting unknown objects more realistic owing to the visual similarity between known and unknown objects. We show through experimental results that a simple method based on the uncertainty of class prediction from standard detectors outperforms the current state-of-the-art OSOD methods tested in the previous setting.      
### 50.Drivable Volumetric Avatars using Texel-Aligned Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09774.pdf)
>  Photorealistic telepresence requires both high-fidelity body modeling and faithful driving to enable dynamically synthesized appearance that is indistinguishable from reality. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework that addresses two core challenges in modeling and driving full-body avatars of real people. One challenge is driving an avatar while staying faithful to details and dynamics that cannot be captured by a global low-dimensional parameterization such as body pose. Our approach supports driving of clothed avatars with wrinkles and motion that a real driving performer exhibits beyond the training corpus. Unlike existing global state representations or non-parametric screen-space approaches, we introduce texel-aligned features -- a localised representation which can leverage both the structural prior of a skeleton-based parametric model and observed sparse image signals at the same time. Another challenge is modeling a temporally coherent clothed avatar, which typically requires precise surface tracking. To circumvent this, we propose a novel volumetric avatar representation by extending mixtures of volumetric primitives to articulated objects. By explicitly incorporating articulation, our approach naturally generalizes to unseen poses. We also introduce a localized viewpoint conditioning, which leads to a large improvement in generalization of view-dependent appearance. The proposed volumetric representation does not require high-quality mesh tracking as a prerequisite and brings significant quality improvements compared to mesh-based counterparts. In our experiments, we carefully examine our design choices and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on challenging driving scenarios.      
### 51.Localization supervision of chest x-ray classifiers using label-specific eye-tracking annotation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09771.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to chest x-ray (CXR) images. Moreover, annotated bounding boxes have been shown to improve the interpretability of a CNN in terms of localizing abnormalities. However, only a few relatively small CXR datasets containing bounding boxes are available, and collecting them is very costly. Opportunely, eye-tracking (ET) data can be collected in a non-intrusive way during the clinical workflow of a radiologist. We use ET data recorded from radiologists while dictating CXR reports to train CNNs. We extract snippets from the ET data by associating them with the dictation of keywords and use them to supervise the localization of abnormalities. We show that this method improves a model's interpretability without impacting its image-level classification.      
### 52.A Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network with Meta Feature Learning for Abnormality Detection in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09769.pdf)
>  Wireless Capsule Endoscopy is one of the most advanced non-invasive methods for the examination of gastrointestinal tracts. An intelligent computer-aided diagnostic system for detecting gastrointestinal abnormalities like polyp, bleeding, inflammation, etc. is highly exigent in wireless capsule endoscopy image analysis. Abnormalities greatly differ in their shape, size, color, and texture, and some appear to be visually similar to normal regions. This poses a challenge in designing a binary classifier due to intra-class variations. In this study, a hybrid convolutional neural network is proposed for abnormality detection that extracts a rich pool of meaningful features from wireless capsule endoscopy images using a variety of convolution operations. It consists of three parallel convolutional neural networks, each with a distinctive feature learning capability. The first network utilizes depthwise separable convolution, while the second employs cosine normalized convolution operation. A novel meta-feature extraction mechanism is introduced in the third network, to extract patterns from the statistical information drawn over the features generated from the first and second networks and its own previous layer. The network trio effectively handles intra-class variance and efficiently detects gastrointestinal abnormalities. The proposed hybrid convolutional neural network model is trained and tested on two widely used publicly available datasets. The test results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms six state-of-the-art methods with 97\% and 98\% classification accuracy on KID and Kvasir-Capsule datasets respectively. Cross dataset evaluation results also demonstrate the generalization performance of the proposed model.      
### 53.Collaborating Domain-shared and Target-specific Feature Clustering for Cross-domain 3D Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09767.pdf)
>  In this work, we consider the problem of cross-domain 3D action recognition in the open-set setting, which has been rarely explored before. Specifically, there is a source domain and a target domain that contain the skeleton sequences with different styles and categories, and our purpose is to cluster the target data by utilizing the labeled source data and unlabeled target data. For such a challenging task, this paper presents a novel approach dubbed CoDT to collaboratively cluster the domain-shared features and target-specific features. CoDT consists of two parallel branches. One branch aims to learn domain-shared features with supervised learning in the source domain, while the other is to learn target-specific features using contrastive learning in the target domain. To cluster the features, we propose an online clustering algorithm that enables simultaneous promotion of robust pseudo label generation and feature clustering. Furthermore, to leverage the complementarity of domain-shared features and target-specific features, we propose a novel collaborative clustering strategy to enforce pair-wise relationship consistency between the two branches. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain 3D action recognition datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.      
### 54.GIPSO: Geometrically Informed Propagation for Online Adaptation in 3D LiDAR Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09763.pdf)
>  3D point cloud semantic segmentation is fundamental for autonomous driving. Most approaches in the literature neglect an important aspect, i.e., how to deal with domain shift when handling dynamic scenes. This can significantly hinder the navigation capabilities of self-driving vehicles. This paper advances the state of the art in this research field. Our first contribution consists in analysing a new unexplored scenario in point cloud segmentation, namely Source-Free Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SF-OUDA). We experimentally show that state-of-the-art methods have a rather limited ability to adapt pre-trained deep network models to unseen domains in an online manner. Our second contribution is an approach that relies on adaptive self-training and geometric-feature propagation to adapt a pre-trained source model online without requiring either source data or target labels. Our third contribution is to study SF-OUDA in a challenging setup where source data is synthetic and target data is point clouds captured in the real world. We use the recent SynLiDAR dataset as a synthetic source and introduce two new synthetic (source) datasets, which can stimulate future synthetic-to-real autonomous driving research. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our segmentation approach on thousands of real-world point clouds.

### 55.Task-adaptive Spatial-Temporal Video Sampler for Few-shot Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09759.pdf)
>  A primary challenge faced in few-shot action recognition is inadequate video data for training. To address this issue, current methods in this field mainly focus on devising algorithms at the feature level while little attention is paid to processing input video data. Moreover, existing frame sampling strategies may omit critical action information in temporal and spatial dimensions, which further impacts video utilization efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel video frame sampler for few-shot action recognition to address this issue, where task-specific spatial-temporal frame sampling is achieved via a temporal selector (TS) and a spatial amplifier (SA). Specifically, our sampler first scans the whole video at a small computational cost to obtain a global perception of video frames. The TS plays its role in selecting top-T frames that contribute most significantly and subsequently. The SA emphasizes the discriminative information of each frame by amplifying critical regions with the guidance of saliency maps. We further adopt task-adaptive learning to dynamically adjust the sampling strategy according to the episode task at hand. Both the implementations of TS and SA are differentiable for end-to-end optimization, facilitating seamless integration of our proposed sampler with most few-shot action recognition methods. Extensive experiments show a significant boost in the performances on various benchmarks including long-term videos.      
### 56.CrossHuman: Learning Cross-Guidance from Multi-Frame Images for Human Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09735.pdf)
>  We propose CrossHuman, a novel method that learns cross-guidance from parametric human model and multi-frame RGB images to achieve high-quality 3D human reconstruction. To recover geometry details and texture even in invisible regions, we design a reconstruction pipeline combined with tracking-based methods and tracking-free methods. Given a monocular RGB sequence, we track the parametric human model in the whole sequence, the points (voxels) corresponding to the target frame are warped to reference frames by the parametric body motion. Guided by the geometry priors of the parametric body and spatially aligned features from RGB sequence, the robust implicit surface is fused. Moreover, a multi-frame transformer (MFT) and a self-supervised warp refinement module are integrated to the framework to relax the requirements of parametric body and help to deal with very loose cloth. Compared with previous works, our CrossHuman enables high-fidelity geometry details and texture in both visible and invisible regions and improves the accuracy of the human reconstruction even under estimated inaccurate parametric human models. The experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.      
### 57.OTPose: Occlusion-Aware Transformer for Pose Estimation in Sparsely-Labeled Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09725.pdf)
>  Although many approaches for multi-human pose estimation in videos have shown profound results, they require densely annotated data which entails excessive man labor. Furthermore, there exists occlusion and motion blur that inevitably lead to poor estimation performance. To address these problems, we propose a method that leverages an attention mask for occluded joints and encodes temporal dependency between frames using transformers. First, our framework composes different combinations of sparsely annotated frames that denote the track of the overall joint movement. We propose an occlusion attention mask from these combinations that enable encoding occlusion-aware heatmaps as a semi-supervised task. Second, the proposed temporal encoder employs transformer architecture to effectively aggregate the temporal relationship and keypoint-wise attention from each time step and accurately refines the target frame's final pose estimation. We achieve state-of-the-art pose estimation results for PoseTrack2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets and demonstrate the robustness of our approach to occlusion and motion blur in sparsely annotated video data.      
### 58.Feature Representation Learning for Unsupervised Cross-domain Image Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09721.pdf)
>  Current supervised cross-domain image retrieval methods can achieve excellent performance. However, the cost of data collection and labeling imposes an intractable barrier to practical deployment in real applications. In this paper, we investigate the unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval task, where class labels and pairing annotations are no longer a prerequisite for training. This is an extremely challenging task because there is no supervision for both in-domain feature representation learning and cross-domain alignment. We address both challenges by introducing: 1) a new cluster-wise contrastive learning mechanism to help extract class semantic-aware features, and 2) a novel distance-of-distance loss to effectively measure and minimize the domain discrepancy without any external supervision. Experiments on the Office-Home and DomainNet datasets consistently show the superior image retrieval accuracies of our framework over state-of-the-art approaches.

### 59.Multi-Task Learning for Emotion Descriptors Estimation at the fourth ABAW Challenge  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09716.pdf)
>  Facial valence/arousal, expression and action unit are related tasks in facial affective analysis. However, the tasks only have limited performance in the wild due to the various collected conditions. The 4th competition on affective behavior analysis in the wild (ABAW) provided images with valence/arousal, expression and action unit labels. In this paper, we introduce multi-task learning framework to enhance the performance of three related tasks in the wild. Feature sharing and label fusion are used to utilize their relations. We conduct experiments on the provided training and validating data.      
### 60.Learning Sequence Representations by Non-local Recurrent Neural Memory  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09710.pdf)
>  The key challenge of sequence representation learning is to capture the long-range temporal dependencies. Typical methods for supervised sequence representation learning are built upon recurrent neural networks to capture temporal dependencies. One potential limitation of these methods is that they only model one-order information interactions explicitly between adjacent time steps in a sequence, hence the high-order interactions between nonadjacent time steps are not fully exploited. It greatly limits the capability of modeling the long-range temporal dependencies since the temporal features learned by one-order interactions cannot be maintained for a long term due to temporal information dilution and gradient vanishing. To tackle this limitation, we propose the Non-local Recurrent Neural Memory (NRNM) for supervised sequence representation learning, which performs non-local operations \MR{by means of self-attention mechanism} to learn full-order interactions within a sliding temporal memory block and models global interactions between memory blocks in a gated recurrent manner. Consequently, our model is able to capture long-range dependencies. Besides, the latent high-level features contained in high-order interactions can be distilled by our model. We validate the effectiveness and generalization of our NRNM on three types of sequence applications across different modalities, including sequence classification, step-wise sequential prediction and sequence similarity learning. Our model compares favorably against other state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each of these sequence applications.      
### 61.Resolving Copycat Problems in Visual Imitation Learning via Residual Action Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09705.pdf)
>  Imitation learning is a widely used policy learning method that enables intelligent agents to acquire complex skills from expert demonstrations. The input to the imitation learning algorithm is usually composed of both the current observation and historical observations since the most recent observation might not contain enough information. This is especially the case with image observations, where a single image only includes one view of the scene, and it suffers from a lack of motion information and object occlusions. In theory, providing multiple observations to the imitation learning agent will lead to better performance. However, surprisingly people find that sometimes imitation from observation histories performs worse than imitation from the most recent observation. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon from the information flow within the neural network perspective. We also propose a novel imitation learning neural network architecture that does not suffer from this issue by design. Furthermore, our method scales to high-dimensional image observations. Finally, we benchmark our approach on two widely used simulators, CARLA and MuJoCo, and it successfully alleviates the copycat problem and surpasses the existing solutions.      
### 62.Robust Object Detection With Inaccurate Bounding Boxes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09697.pdf)
>  Learning accurate object detectors often requires large-scale training data with precise object bounding boxes. However, labeling such data is expensive and time-consuming. As the crowd-sourcing labeling process and the ambiguities of the objects may raise noisy bounding box annotations, the object detectors will suffer from the degenerated training data. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of learning robust object detectors with inaccurate bounding boxes. Inspired by the fact that localization precision suffers significantly from inaccurate bounding boxes while classification accuracy is less affected, we propose leveraging classification as a guidance signal for refining localization results. Specifically, by treating an object as a bag of instances, we introduce an Object-Aware Multiple Instance Learning approach (OA-MIL), featured with object-aware instance selection and object-aware instance extension. The former aims to select accurate instances for training, instead of directly using inaccurate box annotations. The latter focuses on generating high-quality instances for selection. Extensive experiments on synthetic noisy datasets (i.e., noisy PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO) and a real noisy wheat head dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our OA-MIL.

### 63.Efficient Meta-Tuning for Content-aware Neural Video Delivery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09691.pdf)
>  Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are utilized to reduce the bandwidth and improve the quality of Internet video delivery. Existing methods train corresponding content-aware super-resolution (SR) model for each video chunk on the server, and stream low-resolution (LR) video chunks along with SR models to the client. Although they achieve promising results, the huge computational cost of network training limits their practical applications. In this paper, we present a method named Efficient Meta-Tuning (EMT) to reduce the computational cost. Instead of training from scratch, EMT adapts a meta-learned model to the first chunk of the input video. As for the following chunks, it fine-tunes the partial parameters selected by gradient masking of previous adapted model. In order to achieve further speedup for EMT, we propose a novel sampling strategy to extract the most challenging patches from video frames. The proposed strategy is highly efficient and brings negligible additional cost. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost and achieves even better performance, paving the way for applying neural video delivery techniques to practical applications. We conduct extensive experiments based on various efficient SR architectures, including ESPCN, SRCNN, FSRCNN and EDSR-1, demonstrating the generalization ability of our work. The code is released at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Neural-video-delivery/EMT-Pytorch-ECCV2022" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 64.Uncertainty Inspired Underwater Image Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09689.pdf)
>  A main challenge faced in the deep learning-based Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is that the ground truth high-quality image is unavailable. Most of the existing methods first generate approximate reference maps and then train an enhancement network with certainty. This kind of method fails to handle the ambiguity of the reference map. In this paper, we resolve UIE into distribution estimation and consensus process. We present a novel probabilistic network to learn the enhancement distribution of degraded underwater images. Specifically, we combine conditional variational autoencoder with adaptive instance normalization to construct the enhancement distribution. After that, we adopt a consensus process to predict a deterministic result based on a set of samples from the distribution. By learning the enhancement distribution, our method can cope with the bias introduced in the reference map labeling to some extent. Additionally, the consensus process is useful to capture a robust and stable result. We examined the proposed method on two widely used real-world underwater image enhancement datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables sampling possible enhancement predictions. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate yields competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art UIE methods.

### 65.Object-Compositional Neural Implicit Surfaces  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09686.pdf)
>  The neural implicit representation has shown its effectiveness in novel view synthesis and high-quality 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. However, most approaches focus on holistic scene representation yet ignore individual objects inside it, thus limiting potential downstream applications. In order to learn object-compositional representation, a few works incorporate the 2D semantic map as a cue in training to grasp the difference between objects. But they neglect the strong connections between object geometry and instance semantic information, which leads to inaccurate modeling of individual instance. This paper proposes a novel framework, ObjectSDF, to build an object-compositional neural implicit representation with high fidelity in 3D reconstruction and object representation. Observing the ambiguity of conventional volume rendering pipelines, we model the scene by combining the Signed Distance Functions (SDF) of individual object to exert explicit surface constraint. The key in distinguishing different instances is to revisit the strong association between an individual object's SDF and semantic label. Particularly, we convert the semantic information to a function of object SDF and develop a unified and compact representation for scene and objects. Experimental results show the superiority of ObjectSDF framework in representing both the holistic object-compositional scene and the individual instances.

### 66.BigColor: Colorization using a Generative Color Prior for Natural Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09685.pdf)
>  For realistic and vivid colorization, generative priors have recently been exploited. However, such generative priors often fail for in-the-wild complex images due to their limited representation space. In this paper, we propose BigColor, a novel colorization approach that provides vivid colorization for diverse in-the-wild images with complex structures. While previous generative priors are trained to synthesize both image structures and colors, we learn a generative color prior to focus on color synthesis given the spatial structure of an image. In this way, we reduce the burden of synthesizing image structures from the generative prior and expand its representation space to cover diverse images. To this end, we propose a BigGAN-inspired encoder-generator network that uses a spatial feature map instead of a spatially-flattened BigGAN latent code, resulting in an enlarged representation space. Our method enables robust colorization for diverse inputs in a single forward pass, supports arbitrary input resolutions, and provides multi-modal colorization results. We demonstrate that BigColor significantly outperforms existing methods especially on in-the-wild images with complex structures.      
### 67.On the Versatile Uses of Partial Distance Correlation in Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09684.pdf)
>  Comparing the functional behavior of neural network models, whether it is a single network over time or two (or more networks) during or post-training, is an essential step in understanding what they are learning (and what they are not), and for identifying strategies for regularization or efficiency improvements. Despite recent progress, e.g., comparing vision transformers to CNNs, systematic comparison of function, especially across different networks, remains difficult and is often carried out layer by layer. Approaches such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) are applicable in principle, but have been sparingly used so far. In this paper, we revisit a (less widely known) from statistics, called distance correlation (and its partial variant), designed to evaluate correlation between feature spaces of different dimensions. We describe the steps necessary to carry out its deployment for large scale models -- this opens the door to a surprising array of applications ranging from conditioning one deep model w.r.t. another, learning disentangled representations as well as optimizing diverse models that would directly be more robust to adversarial attacks. Our experiments suggest a versatile regularizer (or constraint) with many advantages, which avoids some of the common difficulties one faces in such analyses.

### 68.Explaining Deepfake Detection by Analysing Image Matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09679.pdf)
>  This paper aims to interpret how deepfake detection models learn artifact features of images when just supervised by binary labels. To this end, three hypotheses from the perspective of image matching are proposed as follows. 1. Deepfake detection models indicate real/fake images based on visual concepts that are neither source-relevant nor target-relevant, that is, considering such visual concepts as artifact-relevant. 2. Besides the supervision of binary labels, deepfake detection models implicitly learn artifact-relevant visual concepts through the FST-Matching (i.e. the matching fake, source, target images) in the training set. 3. Implicitly learned artifact visual concepts through the FST-Matching in the raw training set are vulnerable to video compression. In experiments, the above hypotheses are verified among various DNNs. Furthermore, based on this understanding, we propose the FST-Matching Deepfake Detection Model to boost the performance of forgery detection on compressed videos. Experiment results show that our method achieves great performance, especially on highly-compressed (e.g. c40) videos.      
### 69.ERA: Expert Retrieval and Assembly for Early Action Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09675.pdf)
>  Early action prediction aims to successfully predict the class label of an action before it is completely performed. This is a challenging task because the beginning stages of different actions can be very similar, with only minor subtle differences for discrimination. In this paper, we propose a novel Expert Retrieval and Assembly (ERA) module that retrieves and assembles a set of experts most specialized at using discriminative subtle differences, to distinguish an input sample from other highly similar samples. To encourage our model to effectively use subtle differences for early action prediction, we push experts to discriminate exclusively between samples that are highly similar, forcing these experts to learn to use subtle differences that exist between those samples. Additionally, we design an effective Expert Learning Rate Optimization method that balances the experts' optimization and leads to better performance. We evaluate our ERA module on four public action datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance.      
### 70.GRIT: Faster and Better Image captioning Transformer Using Dual Visual Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09666.pdf)
>  Current state-of-the-art methods for image captioning employ region-based features, as they provide object-level information that is essential to describe the content of images; they are usually extracted by an object detector such as Faster R-CNN. However, they have several issues, such as lack of contextual information, the risk of inaccurate detection, and the high computational cost. The first two could be resolved by additionally using grid-based features. However, how to extract and fuse these two types of features is uncharted. This paper proposes a Transformer-only neural architecture, dubbed GRIT (Grid- and Region-based Image captioning Transformer), that effectively utilizes the two visual features to generate better captions. GRIT replaces the CNN-based detector employed in previous methods with a DETR-based one, making it computationally faster. Moreover, its monolithic design consisting only of Transformers enables end-to-end training of the model. This innovative design and the integration of the dual visual features bring about significant performance improvement. The experimental results on several image captioning benchmarks show that GRIT outperforms previous methods in inference accuracy and speed.      
### 71.Pseudo-label Guided Cross-video Pixel Contrast for Robotic Surgical Scene Segmentation with Limited Annotations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09664.pdf)
>  Surgical scene segmentation is fundamentally crucial for prompting cognitive assistance in robotic surgery. However, pixel-wise annotating surgical video in a frame-by-frame manner is expensive and time consuming. To greatly reduce the labeling burden, in this work, we study semi-supervised scene segmentation from robotic surgical video, which is practically essential yet rarely explored before. We consider a clinically suitable annotation situation under the equidistant sampling. We then propose PGV-CL, a novel pseudo-label guided cross-video contrast learning method to boost scene segmentation. It effectively leverages unlabeled data for a trusty and global model regularization that produces more discriminative feature representation. Concretely, for trusty representation learning, we propose to incorporate pseudo labels to instruct the pair selection, obtaining more reliable representation pairs for pixel contrast. Moreover, we expand the representation learning space from previous image-level to cross-video, which can capture the global semantics to benefit the learning process. We extensively evaluate our method on a public robotic surgery dataset EndoVis18 and a public cataract dataset CaDIS. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods under different labeling ratios, and even surpassing fully supervised training on EndoVis18 with 10.1% labeling.      
### 72.Streamable Neural Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09663.pdf)
>  Neural fields have emerged as a new data representation paradigm and have shown remarkable success in various signal representations. Since they preserve signals in their network parameters, the data transfer by sending and receiving the entire model parameters prevents this emerging technology from being used in many practical scenarios. We propose streamable neural fields, a single model that consists of executable sub-networks of various widths. The proposed architectural and training techniques enable a single network to be streamable over time and reconstruct different qualities and parts of signals. For example, a smaller sub-network produces smooth and low-frequency signals, while a larger sub-network can represent fine details. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our method in various domains, such as 2D images, videos, and 3D signed distance functions. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed method improves training stability, by exploiting parameter sharing.      
### 73.HTNet: Anchor-free Temporal Action Localization with Hierarchical Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09662.pdf)
>  Temporal action localization (TAL) is a task of identifying a set of actions in a video, which involves localizing the start and end frames and classifying each action instance. Existing methods have addressed this task by using predefined anchor windows or heuristic bottom-up boundary-matching strategies, which are major bottlenecks in inference time. Additionally, the main challenge is the inability to capture long-range actions due to a lack of global contextual information. In this paper, we present a novel anchor-free framework, referred to as HTNet, which predicts a set of &lt;start time, end time, class&gt; triplets from a video based on a Transformer architecture. After the prediction of coarse boundaries, we refine it through a background feature sampling (BFS) module and hierarchical Transformers, which enables our model to aggregate global contextual information and effectively exploit the inherent semantic relationships in a video. We demonstrate how our method localizes accurate action instances and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two TAL benchmark datasets: THUMOS14 and ActivityNet 1.3.      
### 74.Hand-Assisted Expression Recognition Method from Synthetic Images at the Fourth ABAW Challenge  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09661.pdf)
>  Learning from synthetic images plays an important role in facial expression recognition task due to the difficulties of labeling the real images, and it is challenging because of the gap between the synthetic images and real images. The fourth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild Competition raises the challenge and provides the synthetic images generated from Aff-Wild2 dataset. In this paper, we propose a hand-assisted expression recognition method to reduce the gap between the synthetic data and real data. Our method consists of two parts: expression recognition module and hand prediction module. Expression recognition module extracts expression information and hand prediction module predicts whether the image contains hands. Decision mode is used to combine the results of two modules, and post-pruning is used to improve the result. F1 score is used to verify the effectiveness of our method.      
### 75.Learning Depth from Focus in the Wild  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09658.pdf)
>  For better photography, most recent commercial cameras including smartphones have either adopted large-aperture lens to collect more light or used a burst mode to take multiple images within short times. These interesting features lead us to examine depth from focus/defocus. <br>In this work, we present a convolutional neural network-based depth estimation from single focal stacks. Our method differs from relevant state-of-the-art works with three unique features. First, our method allows depth maps to be inferred in an end-to-end manner even with image alignment. Second, we propose a sharp region detection module to reduce blur ambiguities in subtle focus changes and weakly texture-less regions. Third, we design an effective downsampling module to ease flows of focal information in feature extractions. In addition, for the generalization of the proposed network, we develop a simulator to realistically reproduce the features of commercial cameras, such as changes in field of view, focal length and principal points. <br>By effectively incorporating these three unique features, our network achieves the top rank in the DDFF 12-Scene benchmark on most metrics. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various quantitative evaluations and real-world images taken from various off-the-shelf cameras compared with state-of-the-art methods.

### 76.Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for One-stage Object Detector using Offsets to Bounding Box  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09656.pdf)
>  Most existing domain adaptive object detection methods exploit adversarial feature alignment to adapt the model to a new domain. Recent advances in adversarial feature alignment strives to reduce the negative effect of alignment, or negative transfer, that occurs because the distribution of features varies depending on the category of objects. However, by analyzing the features of the anchor-free one-stage detector, in this paper, we find that negative transfer may occur because the feature distribution varies depending on the regression value for the offset to the bounding box as well as the category. To obtain domain invariance by addressing this issue, we align the feature conditioned on the offset value, considering the modality of the feature distribution. With a very simple and effective conditioning method, we propose OADA (Offset-Aware Domain Adaptive object detector) that achieves state-of-the-art performances in various experimental settings. In addition, by analyzing through singular value decomposition, we find that our model enhances both discriminability and transferability.      
### 77.Learning Topological Interactions for Multi-Class Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09654.pdf)
>  Deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance for multi-class medical image segmentation. However, they are limited in their ability to encode topological interactions among different classes (e.g., containment and exclusion). These constraints naturally arise in biomedical images and can be crucial in improving segmentation quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel topological interaction module to encode the topological interactions into a deep neural network. The implementation is completely convolution-based and thus can be very efficient. This empowers us to incorporate the constraints into end-to-end training and enrich the feature representation of neural networks. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on different types of interactions. We also demonstrate the generalizability of the method on both proprietary and public challenge datasets, in both 2D and 3D settings, as well as across different modalities such as CT and Ultrasound.

### 78.GenText: Unsupervised Artistic Text Generation via Decoupled Font and Texture Manipulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09649.pdf)
>  Automatic artistic text generation is an emerging topic which receives increasing attention due to its wide applications. The artistic text can be divided into three components, content, font, and texture, respectively. Existing artistic text generation models usually focus on manipulating one aspect of the above components, which is a sub-optimal solution for controllable general artistic text generation. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel approach, namely GenText, to achieve general artistic text style transfer by separably migrating the font and texture styles from the different source images to the target images in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, our current work incorporates three different stages, stylization, destylization, and font transfer, respectively, into a unified platform with a single powerful encoder network and two separate style generator networks, one for font transfer, the other for stylization and destylization. The destylization stage first extracts the font style of the font reference image, then the font transfer stage generates the target content with the desired font style. Finally, the stylization stage renders the resulted font image with respect to the texture style in the reference image. Moreover, considering the difficult data acquisition of paired artistic text images, our model is designed under the unsupervised setting, where all stages can be effectively optimized from unpaired data. Qualitative and quantitative results are performed on artistic text benchmarks, which demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model. The code with models will become publicly available in the future.      
### 79.Aware of the History: Trajectory Forecasting with the Local Behavior Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09646.pdf)
>  The historical trajectories previously passing through a location may help infer the future trajectory of an agent currently at this location. Despite great improvements in trajectory forecasting with the guidance of high-definition maps, only a few works have explored such local historical information. In this work, we re-introduce this information as a new type of input data for trajectory forecasting systems: the local behavior data, which we conceptualize as a collection of location-specific historical trajectories. Local behavior data helps the systems emphasize the prediction locality and better understand the impact of static map objects on moving agents. We propose a novel local-behavior-aware (LBA) prediction framework that improves forecasting accuracy by fusing information from observed trajectories, HD maps, and local behavior data. Also, where such historical data is insufficient or unavailable, we employ a local-behavior-free (LBF) prediction framework, which adopts a knowledge-distillation-based architecture to infer the impact of missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that upgrading existing methods with these two frameworks significantly improves their performances. Especially, the LBA framework boosts the SOTA methods' performance on the nuScenes dataset by at least 14% for the K=1 metrics.      
### 80.Hierarchically Self-Supervised Transformer for Human Skeleton Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09644.pdf)
>  Despite the success of fully-supervised human skeleton sequence modeling, utilizing self-supervised pre-training for skeleton sequence representation learning has been an active field because acquiring task-specific skeleton annotations at large scales is difficult. Recent studies focus on learning video-level temporal and discriminative information using contrastive learning, but overlook the hierarchical spatial-temporal nature of human skeletons. Different from such superficial supervision at the video level, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training scheme incorporated into a hierarchical Transformer-based skeleton sequence encoder (Hi-TRS), to explicitly capture spatial, short-term, and long-term temporal dependencies at frame, clip, and video levels, respectively. To evaluate the proposed self-supervised pre-training scheme with Hi-TRS, we conduct extensive experiments covering three skeleton-based downstream tasks including action recognition, action detection, and motion prediction. Under both supervised and semi-supervised evaluation protocols, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that the prior knowledge learned by our model in the pre-training stage has strong transfer capability for different downstream tasks.      
### 81.HyperNet: Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Spatial-Spectral Feature Understanding Network for Hyperspectral Change Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09634.pdf)
>  The fast development of self-supervised learning lowers the bar learning feature representation from massive unlabeled data and has triggered a series of research on change detection of remote sensing images. Challenges in adapting self-supervised learning from natural images classification to remote sensing images change detection arise from difference between the two tasks. The learned patch-level feature representations are not satisfying for the pixel-level precise change detection. In this paper, we proposed a novel pixel-level self-supervised hyperspectral spatial-spectral understanding network (HyperNet) to accomplish pixel-wise feature representation for effective hyperspectral change detection. Concretely, not patches but the whole images are fed into the network and the multi-temporal spatial-spectral features are compared pixel by pixel. Instead of processing the two-dimensional imaging space and spectral response dimension in hybrid style, a powerful spatial-spectral attention module is put forward to explore the spatial correlation and discriminative spectral features of multi-temporal hyperspectral images (HSIs), separately. Only the positive samples at the same location of bi-temporal HSIs are created and forced to be aligned, aiming at learning the spectral difference-invariant features. Moreover, a new similarity loss function named focal cosine is proposed to solve the problem of imbalanced easy and hard positive samples comparison, where the weights of those hard samples are enlarged and highlighted to promote the network training. Six hyperspectral datasets have been adopted to test the validity and generalization of proposed HyperNet. The extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HyperNet over the state-of-the-art algorithms on downstream hyperspectral change detection tasks.      
### 82.Perspective Phase Angle Model for Polarimetric 3D Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09629.pdf)
>  Current polarimetric 3D reconstruction methods, including those in the well-established shape from polarization literature, are all developed under the orthographic projection assumption. In the case of a large field of view, however, this assumption does not hold and may result in significant reconstruction errors in methods that make this assumption. To address this problem, we present the perspective phase angle (PPA) model that is applicable to perspective cameras. Compared with the orthographic model, the proposed PPA model accurately describes the relationship between polarization phase angle and surface normal under perspective projection. In addition, the PPA model makes it possible to estimate surface normals from only one single-view phase angle map and does not suffer from the so-called {\pi}-ambiguity problem. Experiments on real data show that the PPA model is more accurate for surface normal estimation with a perspective camera than the orthographic model.      
### 83.Explicit Image Caption Editing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09625.pdf)
>  Given an image and a reference caption, the image caption editing task aims to correct the misalignment errors and generate a refined caption. However, all existing caption editing works are implicit models, ie, they directly produce the refined captions without explicit connections to the reference captions. In this paper, we introduce a new task: Explicit Caption Editing (ECE). ECE models explicitly generate a sequence of edit operations, and this edit operation sequence can translate the reference caption into a refined one. Compared to the implicit editing, ECE has multiple advantages: 1) Explainable: it can trace the whole editing path. 2) Editing Efficient: it only needs to modify a few words. 3) Human-like: it resembles the way that humans perform caption editing, and tries to keep original sentence structures. To solve this new task, we propose the first ECE model: TIger. TIger is a non-autoregressive transformer-based model, consisting of three modules: Tagger_del, Tagger_add, and Inserter. Specifically, Tagger_del decides whether each word should be preserved or not, Tagger_add decides where to add new words, and Inserter predicts the specific word for adding. To further facilitate ECE research, we propose two new ECE benchmarks by re-organizing two existing datasets, dubbed COCO-EE and Flickr30K-EE, respectively. Extensive ablations on both two benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of TIger.      
### 84.Learning from few examples: Classifying sex from retinal images via deep learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09624.pdf)
>  Deep learning has seen tremendous interest in medical imaging, particularly in the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for developing automated diagnostic tools. The facility of its non-invasive acquisition makes retinal fundus imaging amenable to such automated approaches. Recent work in analyzing fundus images using CNNs relies on access to massive data for training and validation - hundreds of thousands of images. However, data residency and data privacy restrictions stymie the applicability of this approach in medical settings where patient confidentiality is a mandate. Here, we showcase results for the performance of DL on small datasets to classify patient sex from fundus images - a trait thought not to be present or quantifiable in fundus images until recently. We fine-tune a Resnet-152 model whose last layer has been modified for binary classification. In several experiments, we assess performance in the small dataset context using one private (DOVS) and one public (ODIR) data source. Our models, developed using approximately 2500 fundus images, achieved test AUC scores of up to 0.72 (95% CI: [0.67, 0.77]). This corresponds to a mere 25% decrease in performance despite a nearly 1000-fold decrease in the dataset size compared to prior work in the literature. Even with a hard task like sex categorization from retinal images, we find that classification is possible with very small datasets. Additionally, we perform domain adaptation experiments between DOVS and ODIR; explore the effect of data curation on training and generalizability; and investigate model ensembling to maximize CNN classifier performance in the context of small development datasets.      
### 85.Overlooked factors in concept-based explanations: Dataset choice, concept salience, and human capability  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09615.pdf)
>  Concept-based interpretability methods aim to explain deep neural network model predictions using a predefined set of semantic concepts. These methods evaluate a trained model on a new, "probe" dataset and correlate model predictions with the visual concepts labeled in that dataset. Despite their popularity, they suffer from limitations that are not well-understood and articulated by the literature. In this work, we analyze three commonly overlooked factors in concept-based explanations. First, the choice of the probe dataset has a profound impact on the generated explanations. Our analysis reveals that different probe datasets may lead to very different explanations, and suggests that the explanations are not generalizable outside the probe dataset. Second, we find that concepts in the probe dataset are often less salient and harder to learn than the classes they claim to explain, calling into question the correctness of the explanations. We argue that only visually salient concepts should be used in concept-based explanations. Finally, while existing methods use hundreds or even thousands of concepts, our human studies reveal a much stricter upper bound of 32 concepts or less, beyond which the explanations are much less practically useful. We make suggestions for future development and analysis of concept-based interpretability methods.

### 86.Exploiting Domain Transferability for Collaborative Inter-level Domain Adaptive Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09613.pdf)
>  Domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD) has recently drawn much attention owing to its capability of detecting target objects without any annotations. To tackle the problem, previous works focus on aligning features extracted from partial levels (e.g., image-level, instance-level, RPN-level) in a two-stage detector via adversarial training. However, individual levels in the object detection pipeline are closely related to each other and this inter-level relation is unconsidered yet. To this end, we introduce a novel framework for DAOD with three proposed components: Multi-scale-aware Uncertainty Attention (MUA), Transferable Region Proposal Network (TRPN), and Dynamic Instance Sampling (DIS). With these modules, we seek to reduce the negative transfer effect during training while maximizing transferability as well as discriminability in both domains. Finally, our framework implicitly learns domain invariant regions for object detection via exploiting the transferable information and enhances the complementarity between different detection levels by collaboratively utilizing their domain information. Through ablation studies and experiments, we show that the proposed modules contribute to the performance improvement in a synergic way, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.      
### 87.Unsupervised Deep Multi-Shape Matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09610.pdf)
>  3D shape matching is a long-standing problem in computer vision and computer graphics. While deep neural networks were shown to lead to state-of-the-art results in shape matching, existing learning-based approaches are limited in the context of multi-shape matching: (i) either they focus on matching pairs of shapes only and thus suffer from cycle-inconsistent multi-matchings, or (ii) they require an explicit template shape to address the matching of a collection of shapes. In this paper, we present a novel approach for deep multi-shape matching that ensures cycle-consistent multi-matchings while not depending on an explicit template shape. To this end, we utilise a shape-to-universe multi-matching representation that we combine with powerful functional map regularisation, so that our multi-shape matching neural network can be trained in a fully unsupervised manner. While the functional map regularisation is only considered during training time, functional maps are not computed for predicting correspondences, thereby allowing for fast inference. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets, and, most remarkably, that our unsupervised method even outperforms recent supervised methods.      
### 88.Towards Accurate and Robust Classification in Continuously Transitioning Industrial Sprays with Mixup  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09609.pdf)
>  Image classification with deep neural networks has seen a surge of technological breakthroughs with promising applications in areas such as face recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous driving. In engineering problems, however, such as high-speed imaging of engine fuel injector sprays or body paint sprays, deep neural networks face a fundamental challenge related to the availability of adequate and diverse data. Typically, only thousands or sometimes even hundreds of samples are available for training. In addition, the transition between different spray classes is a continuum and requires a high level of domain expertise to label the images accurately. In this work, we used Mixup as an approach to systematically deal with the data scarcity and ambiguous class boundaries found in industrial spray applications. We show that data augmentation can mitigate the over-fitting problem of large neural networks on small data sets, to a certain level, but cannot fundamentally resolve the issue. We discuss how a convex linear interpolation of different classes naturally aligns with the continuous transition between different classes in our application. Our experiments demonstrate Mixup as a simple yet effective method to train an accurate and robust deep neural network classifier with only a few hundred samples.      
### 89.AiATrack: Attention in Attention for Transformer Visual Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09603.pdf)
>  Transformer trackers have achieved impressive advancements recently, where the attention mechanism plays an important role. However, the independent correlation computation in the attention mechanism could result in noisy and ambiguous attention weights, which inhibits further performance improvement. To address this issue, we propose an attention in attention (AiA) module, which enhances appropriate correlations and suppresses erroneous ones by seeking consensus among all correlation vectors. Our AiA module can be readily applied to both self-attention blocks and cross-attention blocks to facilitate feature aggregation and information propagation for visual tracking. Moreover, we propose a streamlined Transformer tracking framework, dubbed AiATrack, by introducing efficient feature reuse and target-background embeddings to make full use of temporal references. Experiments show that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on six tracking benchmarks while running at a real-time speed.      
### 90.A Block-based Convolutional Neural Network for Low-Resolution Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09531.pdf)
>  The success of CNN-based architecture on image classification in learning and extracting features made them so popular these days, but the task of image classification becomes more challenging when we use state of art models to classify noisy and low-quality images. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel image classification architecture that learns subtle details in low-resolution images that are blurred and noisy. In order to build our new blocks, we used the idea of Res Connections and the Inception module ideas. Using the MNIST datasets, we have conducted extensive experiments that show that the introduced architecture is more accurate and faster than other state-of-the-art Convolutional neural networks. As a result of the special characteristics of our model, it can achieve a better result with fewer parameters.      
### 91.Knowledge distillation with a class-aware loss for endoscopic disease detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09530.pdf)
>  Prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is growing alarmingly every year leading to a substantial increase in the mortality rate. Endoscopic detection is providing crucial diagnostic support, however, subtle lesions in upper and lower GI are quite hard to detect and cause considerable missed detection. In this work, we leverage deep learning to develop a framework to improve the localization of difficult to detect lesions and minimize the missed detection rate. We propose an end to end student-teacher learning setup where class probabilities of a trained teacher model on one class with larger dataset are used to penalize multi-class student network. Our model achieves higher performance in terms of mean average precision (mAP) on both endoscopic disease detection (EDD2020) challenge and Kvasir-SEG datasets. Additionally, we show that using such learning paradigm, our model is generalizable to unseen test set giving higher APs for clinically crucial neoplastic and polyp categories      
### 92.The Dice loss in the context of missing or empty labels: Introducing $Φ$ and $ε$  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09521.pdf)
>  Albeit the Dice loss is one of the dominant loss functions in medical image segmentation, most research omits a closer look at its derivative, i.e. the real motor of the optimization when using gradient descent. In this paper, we highlight the peculiar action of the Dice loss in the presence of missing or empty labels. First, we formulate a theoretical basis that gives a general description of the Dice loss and its derivative. It turns out that the choice of the reduction dimensions $\Phi$ and the smoothing term $\epsilon$ is non-trivial and greatly influences its behavior. We find and propose heuristic combinations of $\Phi$ and $\epsilon$ that work in a segmentation setting with either missing or empty labels. Second, we empirically validate these findings in a binary and multiclass segmentation setting using two publicly available datasets. We confirm that the choice of $\Phi$ and $\epsilon$ is indeed pivotal. With $\Phi$ chosen such that the reductions happen over a single batch (and class) element and with a negligible $\epsilon$, the Dice loss deals with missing labels naturally and performs similarly compared to recent adaptations specific for missing labels. With $\Phi$ chosen such that the reductions happen over multiple batch elements or with a heuristic value for $\epsilon$, the Dice loss handles empty labels correctly. We believe that this work highlights some essential perspectives and hope that it encourages researchers to better describe their exact implementation of the Dice loss in future work.      
### 93.Tip-Adapter: Training-free Adaption of CLIP for Few-shot Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09519.pdf)
>  Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training, known as CLIP, has provided a new paradigm for learning visual representations using large-scale image-text pairs. It shows impressive performance on downstream tasks by zero-shot knowledge transfer. To further enhance CLIP's adaption capability, existing methods proposed to fine-tune additional learnable modules, which significantly improves the few-shot performance but introduces extra training time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose a training-free adaption method for CLIP to conduct few-shot classification, termed as Tip-Adapter, which not only inherits the training-free advantage of zero-shot CLIP but also performs comparably to those training-required approaches. Tip-Adapter constructs the adapter via a key-value cache model from the few-shot training set, and updates the prior knowledge encoded in CLIP by feature retrieval. On top of that, the performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted to be state-of-the-art on ImageNet by fine-tuning the cache model for 10$\times$ fewer epochs than existing methods, which is both effective and efficient. We conduct extensive experiments of few-shot classification on 11 datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods. Code is released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/Tip-Adapter" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 94.Contributions of Shape, Texture, and Color in Visual Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09510.pdf)
>  We investigate the contributions of three important features of the human visual system (HVS)~ -- ~shape, texture, and color ~ -- ~to object classification. We build a humanoid vision engine (HVE) that explicitly and separately computes shape, texture, and color features from images. The resulting feature vectors are then concatenated to support the final classification. We show that HVE can summarize and rank-order the contributions of the three features to object recognition. We use human experiments to confirm that both HVE and humans predominantly use some specific features to support the classification of specific classes (e.g., texture is the dominant feature to distinguish a zebra from other quadrupeds, both for humans and HVE). With the help of HVE, given any environment (dataset), we can summarize the most important features for the whole task (task-specific; e.g., color is the most important feature overall for classification with the CUB dataset), and for each class (class-specific; e.g., shape is the most important feature to recognize boats in the iLab-20M dataset). To demonstrate more usefulness of HVE, we use it to simulate the open-world zero-shot learning ability of humans with no attribute labeling. Finally, we show that HVE can also simulate human imagination ability with the combination of different features. We will open-source the HVE engine and corresponding datasets.      
### 95.HSE-NN Team at the 4th ABAW Competition: Multi-task Emotion Recognition and Learning from Synthetic Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09508.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present the results of the HSE-NN team in the 4th competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW). The novel multi-task EfficientNet model is trained for simultaneous recognition of facial expressions and prediction of valence and arousal on static photos. The resulting MT-EmotiEffNet extracts visual features that are fed into simple feed-forward neural networks in the multi-task learning challenge. We obtain performance measure 1.3 on the validation set, which is significantly greater when compared to either performance of baseline (0.3) or existing models that are trained only on the s-Aff-Wild2 database. In the learning from synthetic data challenge, the quality of the original synthetic training set is increased by using the super-resolution techniques, such as Real-ESRGAN. Next, the MT-EmotiEffNet is fine-tuned on the new training set. The final prediction is a simple blending ensemble of pre-trained and fine-tuned MT-EmotiEffNets. Our average validation F1 score is 18% greater than the baseline convolutional neural network.      
### 96.SeasoNet: A Seasonal Scene Classification, segmentation and Retrieval dataset for satellite Imagery over Germany  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09507.pdf)
>  This work presents SeasoNet, a new large-scale multi-label land cover and land use scene understanding dataset. It includes $1\,759\,830$ images from Sentinel-2 tiles, with 12 spectral bands and patch sizes of up to $ 120 \ \mathrm{px} \times 120 \ \mathrm{px}$. Each image is annotated with large scale pixel level labels from the German land cover model LBM-DE2018 with land cover classes based on the CORINE Land Cover database (CLC) 2018 and a five times smaller minimum mapping unit (MMU) than the original CLC maps. We provide pixel synchronous examples from all four seasons, plus an additional snowy set. These properties make SeasoNet the currently most versatile and biggest remote sensing scene understanding dataset with possible applications ranging from scene classification over land cover mapping to content-based cross season image retrieval and self-supervised feature learning. We provide baseline results by evaluating state-of-the-art deep networks on the new dataset in scene classification and semantic segmentation scenarios.      
### 97.An Efficient Method for Face Quality Assessment on the Edge  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09505.pdf)
>  Face recognition applications in practice are composed of two main steps: face detection and feature extraction. In a sole vision-based solution, the first step generates multiple detection for a single identity by ingesting a camera stream. A practical approach on edge devices should prioritize these detection of identities according to their conformity to recognition. In this perspective, we propose a face quality score regression by just appending a single layer to a face landmark detection network. With almost no additional cost, face quality scores are obtained by training this single layer to regress recognition scores with surveillance like augmentations. We implemented the proposed approach on edge GPUs with all face detection pipeline steps, including detection, tracking, and alignment. Comprehensive experiments show the proposed approach's efficiency through comparison with SOTA face quality regression models on different data sets and real-life scenarios.      
### 98.Invariant Feature Learning for Generalized Long-Tailed Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09504.pdf)
>  Existing long-tailed classification (LT) methods only focus on tackling the class-wise imbalance that head classes have more samples than tail classes, but overlook the attribute-wise imbalance. In fact, even if the class is balanced, samples within each class may still be long-tailed due to the varying attributes. Note that the latter is fundamentally more ubiquitous and challenging than the former because attributes are not just implicit for most datasets, but also combinatorially complex, thus prohibitively expensive to be balanced. Therefore, we introduce a novel research problem: Generalized Long-Tailed classification (GLT), to jointly consider both kinds of imbalances. By "generalized", we mean that a GLT method should naturally solve the traditional LT, but not vice versa. Not surprisingly, we find that most class-wise LT methods degenerate in our proposed two benchmarks: ImageNet-GLT and MSCOCO-GLT. We argue that it is because they over-emphasize the adjustment of class distribution while neglecting to learn attribute-invariant features. To this end, we propose an Invariant Feature Learning (IFL) method as the first strong baseline for GLT. IFL first discovers environments with divergent intra-class distributions from the imperfect predictions and then learns invariant features across them. Promisingly, as an improved feature backbone, IFL boosts all the LT line-up: one/two-stage re-balance, augmentation, and ensemble. Codes and benchmarks are available on Github: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Generalized-Long-Tailed-Benchmarks.pytorch" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 99.Deep Analysis of Visual Product Reviews  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09499.pdf)
>  With the proliferation of the e-commerce industry, analyzing customer feedback is becoming indispensable to a service provider. In recent days, it can be noticed that customers upload the purchased product images with their review scores. In this paper, we undertake the task of analyzing such visual reviews, which is very new of its kind. In the past, the researchers worked on analyzing language feedback, but here we do not take any assistance from linguistic reviews that may be absent, since a recent trend can be observed where customers prefer to quickly upload the visual feedback instead of typing language feedback. We propose a hierarchical architecture, where the higher-level model engages in product categorization, and the lower-level model pays attention to predicting the review score from a customer-provided product image. We generated a database by procuring real visual product reviews, which was quite challenging. Our architecture obtained some promising results by performing extensive experiments on the employed database. The proposed hierarchical architecture attained a 57.48% performance improvement over the single-level best comparable architecture.      
### 100.Single Frame Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation: A Benchmark Study and A New Physics-Inspired Transformer Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10040.pdf)
>  Image restoration algorithms for atmospheric turbulence are known to be much more challenging to design than traditional ones such as blur or noise because the distortion caused by the turbulence is an entanglement of spatially varying blur, geometric distortion, and sensor noise. Existing CNN-based restoration methods built upon convolutional kernels with static weights are insufficient to handle the spatially dynamical atmospheric turbulence effect. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a physics-inspired transformer model for imaging through atmospheric turbulence. The proposed network utilizes the power of transformer blocks to jointly extract a dynamical turbulence distortion map and restore a turbulence-free image. In addition, recognizing the lack of a comprehensive dataset, we collect and present two new real-world turbulence datasets that allow for evaluation with both classical objective metrics (e.g., PSNR and SSIM) and a new task-driven metric using text recognition accuracy. Both real testing sets and all related code will be made publicly available.      
### 101.BYEL : Bootstrap on Your Emotion Latent  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10003.pdf)
>  According to the problem of dataset construction cost for training in deep learning and the development of generative models, more and more researches are being conducted to train with synthetic data and to inference using real data. We propose emotion aware Self-Supervised Learning using ABAW's Learning Synthetic Data (LSD) dataset. We pre-train our method to LSD dataset as a self-supervised learning and then use the same LSD dataset to do downstream training on the emotion classification task as a supervised learning. As a result, a higher result(0.63) than baseline(0.5) was obtained.      
### 102.Probable Domain Generalization via Quantile Risk Minimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09944.pdf)
>  Domain generalization (DG) seeks predictors which perform well on unseen test distributions by leveraging labeled training data from multiple related distributions or domains. To achieve this, the standard formulation optimizes for worst-case performance over the set of all possible domains. However, with worst-case shifts very unlikely in practice, this generally leads to overly-conservative solutions. In fact, a recent study found that no DG algorithm outperformed empirical risk minimization in terms of average performance. In this work, we argue that DG is neither a worst-case problem nor an average-case problem, but rather a probabilistic one. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework for DG, which we call Probable Domain Generalization, wherein our key idea is that distribution shifts seen during training should inform us of probable shifts at test time. To realize this, we explicitly relate training and test domains as draws from the same underlying meta-distribution, and propose a new optimization problem -- Quantile Risk Minimization (QRM) -- which requires that predictors generalize with high probability. We then prove that QRM: (i) produces predictors that generalize to new domains with a desired probability, given sufficiently many domains and samples; and (ii) recovers the causal predictor as the desired probability of generalization approaches one. In our experiments, we introduce a more holistic quantile-focused evaluation protocol for DG, and show that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art baselines on real and synthetic data.      
### 103.DeepIPC: Deeply Integrated Perception and Control for Mobile Robot in Real Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09934.pdf)
>  We propose DeepIPC, an end-to-end multi-task model that handles both perception and control tasks in driving a mobile robot autonomously. The model consists of two main parts, perception and controller modules. The perception module takes RGB image and depth map to perform semantic segmentation and bird's eye view (BEV) semantic mapping along with providing their encoded features. Meanwhile, the controller module processes these features with the measurement of GNSS locations and angular speed to estimate waypoints that come with latent features. Then, two different agents are used to translate waypoints and latent features into a set of navigational controls to drive the robot. The model is evaluated by predicting driving records and performing automated driving under various conditions in the real environment. Based on the experimental results, DeepIPC achieves the best drivability and multi-task performance even with fewer parameters compared to the other models.      
### 104.An Embedded Monocular Vision Approach for Ground-Aware Objects Detection and Position Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09851.pdf)
>  In the RoboCup Small Size League (SSL), teams are encouraged to propose solutions for executing basic soccer tasks inside the SSL field using only embedded sensing information. Thus, this work proposes an embedded monocular vision approach for detecting objects and estimating relative positions inside the soccer field. Prior knowledge from the environment is exploited by assuming objects lay on the ground, and the onboard camera has its position fixed on the robot. We implemented the proposed method on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano and employed SSD MobileNet v2 for 2D Object Detection with TensorRT optimization, detecting balls, robots, and goals with distances up to 3.5 meters. Ball localization evaluation shows that the proposed solution overcomes the currently used SSL vision system for positions closer than 1 meter to the onboard camera with a Root Mean Square Error of 14.37 millimeters. In addition, the proposed method achieves real-time performance with an average processing speed of 30 frames per second.      
### 105.Predicting Word Learning in Children from the Performance of Computer Vision Systems  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09847.pdf)
>  For human children as well as machine learning systems, a key challenge in learning a word is linking the word to the visual phenomena it describes. We explore this aspect of word learning by using the performance of computer vision systems as a proxy for the difficulty of learning a word from visual cues. We show that the age at which children acquire different categories of words is predicted by the performance of visual classification and captioning systems, over and above the expected effects of word frequency. The performance of the computer vision systems is related to human judgments of the concreteness of words, supporting the idea that we are capturing the relationship between words and visual phenomena.      
### 106.Facial Affect Analysis: Learning from Synthetic Data &amp; Multi-Task Learning Challenges  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09748.pdf)
>  Facial affect analysis remains a challenging task with its setting transitioned from lab-controlled to in-the-wild situations. In this paper, we present novel frameworks to handle the two challenges in the 4th Affective Behavior Analysis In-The-Wild (ABAW) competition: i) Multi-Task-Learning (MTL) Challenge and ii) Learning from Synthetic Data (LSD) Challenge. For MTL challenge, we adopt the SMM-EmotionNet with a better ensemble strategy of feature vectors. For LSD challenge, we propose respective methods to combat the problems of single labels, imbalanced distribution, fine-tuning limitations, and choice of model architectures. Experimental results on the official validation sets from the competition demonstrated that our proposed approaches outperformed baselines by a large margin.

### 107.Interpreting Latent Spaces of Generative Models for Medical Images using Unsupervised Methods  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09740.pdf)
>  Generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) play an increasingly important role in medical image analysis. The latent spaces of these models often show semantically meaningful directions corresponding to human-interpretable image transformations. However, until now, their exploration for medical images has been limited due to the requirement of supervised data. Several methods for unsupervised discovery of interpretable directions in GAN latent spaces have shown interesting results on natural images. This work explores the potential of applying these techniques on medical images by training a GAN and a VAE on thoracic CT scans and using an unsupervised method to discover interpretable directions in the resulting latent space. We find several directions corresponding to non-trivial image transformations, such as rotation or breast size. Furthermore, the directions show that the generative models capture 3D structure despite being presented only with 2D data. The results show that unsupervised methods to discover interpretable directions in GANs generalize to VAEs and can be applied to medical images. This opens a wide array of future work using these methods in medical image analysis.      
### 108.Revisiting data augmentation for subspace clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09728.pdf)
>  Subspace clustering is the classical problem of clustering a collection of data samples that approximately lie around several low-dimensional subspaces. The current state-of-the-art approaches for this problem are based on the self-expressive model which represents the samples as linear combination of other samples. However, these approaches require sufficiently well-spread samples for accurate representation which might not be necessarily accessible in many applications. In this paper, we shed light on this commonly neglected issue and argue that data distribution within each subspace plays a critical role in the success of self-expressive models. Our proposed solution to tackle this issue is motivated by the central role of data augmentation in the generalization power of deep neural networks. We propose two subspace clustering frameworks for both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings that use augmented samples as an enlarged dictionary to improve the quality of the self-expressive representation. We present an automatic augmentation strategy using a few labeled samples for the semi-supervised problem relying on the fact that the data samples lie in the union of multiple linear subspaces. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of data augmentation, as it significantly improves the performance of general self-expressive models.      
### 109.DC-BENCH: Dataset Condensation Benchmark  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09639.pdf)
>  Dataset Condensation is a newly emerging technique aiming at learning a tiny dataset that captures the rich information encoded in the original dataset. As the size of datasets contemporary machine learning models rely on becomes increasingly large, condensation methods become a prominent direction for accelerating network training and reducing data storage. Despite numerous methods have been proposed in this rapidly growing field, evaluating and comparing different condensation methods is non-trivial and still remains an open issue. The quality of condensed dataset are often shadowed by many critical contributing factors to the end performance, such as data augmentation and model architectures. The lack of a systematic way to evaluate and compare condensation methods not only hinders our understanding of existing techniques, but also discourages practical usage of the synthesized datasets. This work provides the first large-scale standardized benchmark on Dataset Condensation. It consists of a suite of evaluations to comprehensively reflect the generability and effectiveness of condensation methods through the lens of their generated dataset. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a large-scale study of current condensation methods, and report many insightful findings that open up new possibilities for future development. The benchmark library, including evaluators, baseline methods, and generated datasets, is open-sourced to facilitate future research and application.      
### 110.EVHA: Explainable Vision System for Hardware Testing and Assurance -- An Overview  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09627.pdf)
>  Due to the ever-growing demands for electronic chips in different sectors the semiconductor companies have been mandated to offshore their manufacturing processes. This unwanted matter has made security and trustworthiness of their fabricated chips concerning and caused creation of hardware attacks. In this condition, different entities in the semiconductor supply chain can act maliciously and execute an attack on the design computing layers, from devices to systems. Our attack is a hardware Trojan that is inserted during mask generation/fabrication in an untrusted foundry. The Trojan leaves a footprint in the fabricated through addition, deletion, or change of design cells. In order to tackle this problem, we propose Explainable Vision System for Hardware Testing and Assurance (EVHA) in this work that can detect the smallest possible change to a design in a low-cost, accurate, and fast manner. The inputs to this system are Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images acquired from the Integrated Circuits (ICs) under examination. The system output is determination of IC status in terms of having any defect and/or hardware Trojan through addition, deletion, or change in the design cells at the cell-level. This article provides an overview on the design, development, implementation, and analysis of our defense system.      
### 111.ICRICS: Iterative Compensation Recovery for Image Compressive Sensing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09594.pdf)
>  Closed-loop architecture is widely utilized in automatic control systems and attain distinguished performance. However, classical compressive sensing systems employ open-loop architecture with separated sampling and reconstruction units. Therefore, a method of iterative compensation recovery for image compressive sensing (ICRICS) is proposed by introducing closed-loop framework into traditional compresses sensing systems. The proposed method depends on any existing approaches and upgrades their reconstruction performance by adding negative feedback structure. Theory analysis on negative feedback of compressive sensing systems is performed. An approximate mathematical proof of the effectiveness of the proposed method is also provided. Simulation experiments on more than 3 image datasets show that the proposed method is superior to 10 competition approaches in reconstruction performance. The maximum increment of average peak signal-to-noise ratio is 4.36 dB and the maximum increment of average structural similarity is 0.034 on one dataset. The proposed method based on negative feedback mechanism can efficiently correct the recovery error in the existing systems of image compressive sensing.      
### 112.Segmentation of 3D Dental Images Using Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09582.pdf)
>  3D image segmentation is a recent and crucial step in many medical analysis and recognition schemes. In fact, it represents a relevant research subject and a fundamental challenge due to its importance and influence. This paper provides a multi-phase Deep Learning-based system that hybridizes various efficient methods in order to get the best 3D segmentation output. First, to reduce the amount of data and accelerate the processing time, the application of Decimate compression technique is suggested and justified. We then use a CNN model to segment dental images into fifteen separated classes. In the end, a special KNN-based transformation is applied for the purpose of removing isolated meshes and of correcting dental forms. Experimentations demonstrate the precision and the robustness of the selected framework applied to 3D dental images within a private clinical benchmark.      
### 113.Comparison of automatic prostate zones segmentation models in MRI images using U-net-like architectures  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09483.pdf)
>  Prostate cancer is the second-most frequently diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in males worldwide. The main problem that specialists face during the diagnosis of prostate cancer is the localization of Regions of Interest (ROI) containing a tumor tissue. Currently, the segmentation of this ROI in most cases is carried out manually by expert doctors, but the procedure is plagued with low detection rates (of about 27-44%) or overdiagnosis in some patients. Therefore, several research works have tackled the challenge of automatically segmenting and extracting features of the ROI from magnetic resonance images, as this process can greatly facilitate many diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, the lack of clear prostate boundaries, the heterogeneity inherent to the prostate tissue, and the variety of prostate shapes makes this process very difficult to <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://automate.In" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> this work, six deep learning models were trained and analyzed with a dataset of MRI images obtained from the Centre Hospitalaire de Dijon and Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. We carried out a comparison of multiple deep learning models (i.e. U-Net, Attention U-Net, Dense-UNet, Attention Dense-UNet, R2U-Net, and Attention R2U-Net) using categorical cross-entropy loss function. The analysis was performed using three metrics commonly used for image segmentation: Dice score, Jaccard index, and mean squared error. The model that give us the best result segmenting all the zones was R2U-Net, which achieved 0.869, 0.782, and 0.00013 for Dice, Jaccard and mean squared error, respectively.
