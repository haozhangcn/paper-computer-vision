### 1.Beyond mAP: Re-evaluating and Improving Performance in Instance Segmentation with Semantic Sorting and Contrastive Flow  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01614.pdf)
>  Top-down instance segmentation methods improve mAP by hedging bets on low-confidence predictions to match a ground truth. Moreover, the query-key paradigm of top-down methods leads to the instance merging problem. An excessive number of duplicate predictions leads to the (over)counting error, and the independence of category and localization branches leads to the naming error. The de-facto mAP metric doesn't capture these errors, as we show that a trivial dithering scheme can simultaneously increase mAP with hedging errors. To this end, we propose two graph-based metrics that quantifies the amount of hedging both inter-and intra-class. We conjecture the source of the hedging problem is due to feature merging and propose a) Contrastive Flow Field to encode contextual differences between instances as a supervisory signal, and b) Semantic Sorting and NMS step to suppress duplicates and incorrectly categorized prediction. Ablations show that our method encodes contextual information better than baselines, and experiments on COCO our method simultaneously reduces merging and hedging errors compared to state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods.      
### 2.PVO: Panoptic Visual Odometry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01610.pdf)
>  We present a novel panoptic visual odometry framework, termed PVO, to achieve a more comprehensive modeling of the scene's motion, geometry, and panoptic segmentation information. PVO models visual odometry (VO) and video panoptic segmentation (VPS) in a unified view, enabling the two tasks to facilitate each other. Specifically, we introduce a panoptic update module into the VO module, which operates on the image panoptic segmentation. This Panoptic-Enhanced VO module can trim the interference of dynamic objects in the camera pose estimation by adjusting the weights of optimized camera poses. On the other hand, the VO-Enhanced VPS module improves the segmentation accuracy by fusing the panoptic segmentation result of the current frame on the fly to the adjacent frames, using geometric information such as camera pose, depth, and optical flow obtained from the VO module. These two modules contribute to each other through a recurrent iterative optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PVO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual odometry and video panoptic segmentation tasks.

### 3.CRFormer: A Cross-Region Transformer for Shadow Removal  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01600.pdf)
>  Aiming to restore the original intensity of shadow regions in an image and make them compatible with the remaining non-shadow regions without a trace, shadow removal is a very challenging problem that benefits many downstream image/video-related tasks. Recently, transformers have shown their strong capability in various applications by capturing global pixel interactions and this capability is highly desirable in shadow removal. However, applying transformers to promote shadow removal is non-trivial for the following two reasons: 1) The patchify operation is not suitable for shadow removal due to irregular shadow shapes; 2) shadow removal only needs one-way interaction from the non-shadow region to the shadow region instead of the common two-way interactions among all pixels in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-region transformer, namely CRFormer, for shadow removal which differs from existing transformers by only considering the pixel interactions from the non-shadow region to the shadow region without splitting images into patches. This is achieved by a carefully designed region-aware cross-attention operation that can aggregate the recovered shadow region features conditioned on the non-shadow region features. Extensive experiments on ISTD, AISTD, SRD, and Video Shadow Removal datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.      
### 4.LaTeRF: Label and Text Driven Object Radiance Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01583.pdf)
>  Obtaining 3D object representations is important for creating photo-realistic simulators and collecting assets for AR/VR applications. Neural fields have shown their effectiveness in learning a continuous volumetric representation of a scene from 2D images, but acquiring object representations from these models with weak supervision remains an open challenge. In this paper we introduce LaTeRF, a method for extracting an object of interest from a scene given 2D images of the entire scene and known camera poses, a natural language description of the object, and a small number of point-labels of object and non-object points in the input images. To faithfully extract the object from the scene, LaTeRF extends the NeRF formulation with an additional `objectness' probability at each 3D point. Additionally, we leverage the rich latent space of a pre-trained CLIP model combined with our differentiable object renderer, to inpaint the occluded parts of the object. We demonstrate high-fidelity object extraction on both synthetic and real datasets and justify our design choices through an extensive ablation study.      
### 5.Dynamic Spatial Sparsification for Efficient Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01580.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a new approach for model acceleration by exploiting spatial sparsity in visual data. We observe that the final prediction in vision Transformers is only based on a subset of the most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input to accelerate vision Transformers. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. While the framework is inspired by our observation of the sparse attention in vision Transformers, we find the idea of adaptive and asymmetric computation can be a general solution for accelerating various architectures. We extend our method to hierarchical models including CNNs and hierarchical vision Transformers as well as more complex dense prediction tasks that require structured feature maps by formulating a more generic dynamic spatial sparsification framework with progressive sparsification and asymmetric computation for different spatial locations. By applying lightweight fast paths to less informative features and using more expressive slow paths to more important locations, we can maintain the structure of feature maps while significantly reducing the overall computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on various modern architectures and different visual recognition tasks. Our results clearly demonstrate that dynamic spatial sparsification offers a new and more effective dimension for model acceleration.

### 6.Embedding contrastive unsupervised features to cluster in- and out-of-distribution noise in corrupted image datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01573.pdf)
>  Using search engines for web image retrieval is a tempting alternative to manual curation when creating an image dataset, but their main drawback remains the proportion of incorrect (noisy) samples retrieved. These noisy samples have been evidenced by previous works to be a mixture of in-distribution (ID) samples, assigned to the incorrect category but presenting similar visual semantics to other classes in the dataset, and out-of-distribution (OOD) images, which share no semantic correlation with any category from the dataset. The latter are, in practice, the dominant type of noisy images retrieved. To tackle this noise duality, we propose a two stage algorithm starting with a detection step where we use unsupervised contrastive feature learning to represent images in a feature space. We find that the alignment and uniformity principles of contrastive learning allow OOD samples to be linearly separated from ID samples on the unit hypersphere. We then spectrally embed the unsupervised representations using a fixed neighborhood size and apply an outlier sensitive clustering at the class level to detect the clean and OOD clusters as well as ID noisy outliers. We finally train a noise robust neural network that corrects ID noise to the correct category and utilizes OOD samples in a guided contrastive objective, clustering them to improve low-level features. Our algorithm improves the state-of-the-art results on synthetic noise image datasets as well as real-world web-crawled data. Our work is fully reproducible [github].      
### 7.Back to MLP: A Simple Baseline for Human Motion Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01567.pdf)
>  This paper tackles the problem of human motion prediction, consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences. Despite of their performance, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on deep learning architectures of arbitrary complexity, such as Recurrent Neural Networks~(RNN), Transformers or Graph Convolutional Networks~(GCN), typically requiring multiple training stages and more than 3 million of parameters. In this paper we show that the performance of these approaches can be surpassed by a light-weight and purely MLP architecture with only 0.14M parameters when appropriately combined with several standard practices such as representing the body pose with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), predicting residual displacement of joints and optimizing velocity as an auxiliary loss. <br>An exhaustive evaluation on Human3.6M, AMASS and 3DPW datasets shows that our method, which we dub siMLPe, consistently outperforms all other approaches. We hope that our simple method could serve a strong baseline to the community and allow re-thinking the problem of human motion prediction and whether current benchmarks do really need intricate architectural designs.

### 8.Fidelity of Ensemble Aggregation for Saliency Map Explanations using Bayesian Optimization Techniques  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01565.pdf)
>  In recent years, an abundance of feature attribution methods for explaining neural networks have been developed. Especially in the field of computer vision, many methods for generating saliency maps providing pixel attributions exist. However, their explanations often contradict each other and it is not clear which explanation to trust. A natural solution to this problem is the aggregation of multiple explanations. We present and compare different pixel-based aggregation schemes with the goal of generating a new explanation, whose fidelity to the model's decision is higher than each individual explanation. Using methods from the field of Bayesian Optimization, we incorporate the variance between the individual explanations into the aggregation process. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multiple normalization techniques on ensemble aggregation.      
### 9.Progressive Latent Replay for efficient Generative Rehearsal  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01562.pdf)
>  We introduce a new method for internal replay that modulates the frequency of rehearsal based on the depth of the network. While replay strategies mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, recent works on generative replay show that performing the rehearsal only on the deeper layers of the network improves the performance in continual learning. However, the generative approach introduces additional computational overhead, limiting its applications. Motivated by the observation that earlier layers of neural networks forget less abruptly, we propose to update network layers with varying frequency using intermediate-level features during replay. This reduces the computational burden by omitting computations for both deeper layers of the generator and earlier layers of the main model. We name our method Progressive Latent Replay and show that it outperforms Internal Replay while using significantly fewer resources.      
### 10.Selectively increasing the diversity of GAN-generated samples  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01561.pdf)
>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful models able to synthesize data samples closely resembling the distribution of real data, yet the diversity of those generated samples is limited due to the so-called mode collapse phenomenon observed in GANs. Especially prone to mode collapse are conditional GANs, which tend to ignore the input noise vector and focus on the conditional information. Recent methods proposed to mitigate this limitation increase the diversity of generated samples, yet they reduce the performance of the models when similarity of samples is required. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel method to selectively increase the diversity of GAN-generated samples. By adding a simple, yet effective regularization to the training loss function we encourage the generator to discover new data modes for inputs related to diverse outputs while generating consistent samples for the remaining ones. More precisely, we maximise the ratio of distances between generated images and input latent vectors scaling the effect according to the diversity of samples for a given conditional input. We show the superiority of our method in a synthetic benchmark as well as a real-life scenario of simulating data from the Zero Degree Calorimeter of ALICE experiment in LHC, CERN.      
### 11.Masked Autoencoders in 3D Point Cloud Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01545.pdf)
>  Transformer-based Self-supervised Representation Learning methods learn generic features from unlabeled datasets for providing useful network initialization parameters for downstream tasks. Recently, self-supervised learning based upon masking local surface patches for 3D point cloud data has been under-explored. In this paper, we propose masked Autoencoders in 3D point cloud representation learning (abbreviated as MAE3D), a novel autoencoding paradigm for self-supervised learning. We first split the input point cloud into patches and mask a portion of them, then use our Patch Embedding Module to extract the features of unmasked patches. Secondly, we employ patch-wise MAE3D Transformers to learn both local features of point cloud patches and high-level contextual relationships between patches and complete the latent representations of masked patches. We use our Point Cloud Reconstruction Module with multi-task loss to complete the incomplete point cloud as a result. We conduct self-supervised pre-training on ShapeNet55 with the point cloud completion pre-text task and fine-tune the pre-trained model on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN (PB\_T50\_RS, the hardest variant). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the local features extracted by our MAE3D from point cloud patches are beneficial for downstream classification tasks, soundly outperforming state-of-the-art methods ($93.4\%$ and $86.2\%$ classification accuracy, respectively).      
### 12.Efficient Lung Cancer Image Classification and Segmentation Algorithm Based on Improved Swin Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01527.pdf)
>  With the development of computer technology, various models have emerged in artificial intelligence. The transformer model has been applied to the field of computer vision (CV) after its success in natural language processing (NLP). Radiologists continue to face multiple challenges in today's rapidly evolving medical field, such as increased workload and increased diagnostic demands. Although there are some conventional methods for lung cancer detection before, their accuracy still needs to be improved, especially in realistic diagnostic scenarios. This paper creatively proposes a segmentation method based on efficient transformer and applies it to medical image analysis. The algorithm completes the task of lung cancer classification and segmentation by analyzing lung cancer data, and aims to provide efficient technical support for medical staff. In addition, we evaluated and compared the results in various aspects. For the classification mission, the max accuracy of Swin-T by regular training and Swin-B in two resolutions by pre-training can be up to 82.3%. For the segmentation mission, we use pre-training to help the model improve the accuracy of our experiments. The accuracy of the three models reaches over 95%. The experiments demonstrate that the algorithm can be well applied to lung cancer classification and segmentation missions.      
### 13.Physics-informed compressed sensing for PC-MRI: an inverse Navier-Stokes problem  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01466.pdf)
>  We formulate a physics-informed compressed sensing (PICS) method for the reconstruction of velocity fields from noisy and sparse phase-contrast magnetic resonance signals. The method solves an inverse Navier-Stokes boundary value problem, which permits us to jointly reconstruct and segment the velocity field, and at the same time infer hidden quantities such as the hydrodynamic pressure and the wall shear stress. Using a Bayesian framework, we regularize the problem by introducing a priori information about the unknown parameters in the form of Gaussian random fields. This prior information is updated using the Navier-Stokes problem, an energy-based segmentation functional, and by requiring that the reconstruction is consistent with the $k$-space signals. We create an algorithm that solves this reconstruction problem, and test it for noisy and sparse $k$-space signals of the flow through a converging nozzle. We find that the method is capable of reconstructing and segmenting the velocity fields from sparsely-sampled (15% $k$-space coverage), low ($\sim$$10$) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, and that the reconstructed velocity field compares well with that derived from fully-sampled (100% $k$-space coverage) high ($&gt;40$) SNR signals of the same flow.      
### 14.Explicit Boundary Guided Semi-Push-Pull Contrastive Learning for Better Anomaly Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01463.pdf)
>  Most of anomaly detection algorithms are mainly focused on modeling the distribution of normal samples and treating anomalies as outliers. However, the discriminative performance of the model may be insufficient due to the lack of knowledge about anomalies. Thus, anomalies should be exploited as possible. However, utilizing a few known anomalies during training may cause another issue that model may be biased by those known anomalies and fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. In this paper, we aim to exploit a few existing anomalies with a carefully designed explicit boundary guided semi-push-pull learning strategy, which can enhance discriminability while mitigating bias problem caused by insufficient known anomalies. Our model is based on two core designs: First, finding one explicit separating boundary as the guidance for further contrastive learning. Specifically, we employ normalizing flow to learn normal feature distribution, then find an explicit separating boundary close to the distribution edge. The obtained explicit and compact separating boundary only relies on the normal feature distribution, thus the bias problem caused by a few known anomalies can be mitigated. Second, learning more discriminative features under the guidance of the explicit separating boundary. A boundary guided semi-push-pull loss is developed to only pull the normal features together while pushing the abnormal features apart from the separating boundary beyond a certain margin region. In this way, our model can form a more explicit and discriminative decision boundary to achieve better results for known and also unseen anomalies, while also maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments on the widely-used MVTecAD benchmark show that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results, with the performance of 98.8% image-level AUROC and 99.4% pixel-level AUROC.      
### 15.DeepPyramid: Enabling Pyramid View and Deformable Pyramid Reception for Semantic Segmentation in Cataract Surgery Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01453.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation in cataract surgery has a wide range of applications contributing to surgical outcome enhancement and clinical risk reduction. However, the varying issues in segmenting the different relevant structures in these surgeries make the designation of a unique network quite challenging. This paper proposes a semantic segmentation network, termed DeepPyramid, that can deal with these challenges using three novelties: (1) a Pyramid View Fusion module which provides a varying-angle global view of the surrounding region centering at each pixel position in the input convolutional feature map; (2) a Deformable Pyramid Reception module which enables a wide deformable receptive field that can adapt to geometric transformations in the object of interest; and (3) a dedicated Pyramid Loss that adaptively supervises multi-scale semantic feature maps. Combined, we show that these modules can effectively boost semantic segmentation performance, especially in the case of transparency, deformability, scalability, and blunt edges in objects. We demonstrate that our approach performs at a state-of-the-art level and outperforms a number of existing methods with a large margin (3.66% overall improvement in intersection over union compared to the best rival approach).      
### 16.Open-world Semantic Segmentation for LIDAR Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01452.pdf)
>  Current methods for LIDAR semantic segmentation are not robust enough for real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving, since it is closed-set and static. The closed-set assumption makes the network only able to output labels of trained classes, even for objects never seen before, while a static network cannot update its knowledge base according to what it has seen. Therefore, in this work, we propose the open-world semantic segmentation task for LIDAR point clouds, which aims to 1) identify both old and novel classes using open-set semantic segmentation, and 2) gradually incorporate novel objects into the existing knowledge base using incremental learning without forgetting old classes. For this purpose, we propose a REdundAncy cLassifier (REAL) framework to provide a general architecture for both the open-set semantic segmentation and incremental learning problems. The experimental results show that REAL can simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance in the open-set semantic segmentation task on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets, and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem with a large margin during incremental learning.      
### 17.A Robust Ensemble Model for Patasitic Egg Detection and Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01419.pdf)
>  Intestinal parasitic infections, as a leading causes of morbidity worldwide, still lacks time-saving, high-sensitivity and user-friendly examination method. The development of deep learning technique reveals its broad application potential in biological image. In this paper, we apply several object detectors such as YOLOv5 and variant cascadeRCNNs to automatically discriminate parasitic eggs in microscope images. Through specially-designed optimization including raw data augmentation, model ensemble, transfer learning and test time augmentation, our model achieves excellent performance on challenge dataset. In addition, our model trained with added noise gains a high robustness against polluted input, which further broaden its applicability in practice.      
### 18.Positive-Negative Equal Contrastive Loss for Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01417.pdf)
>  The contextual information is critical for various computer vision tasks, previous works commonly design plug-and-play modules and structural losses to effectively extract and aggregate the global context. These methods utilize fine-label to optimize the model but ignore that fine-trained features are also precious training resources, which can introduce preferable distribution to hard pixels (i.e., misclassified pixels). Inspired by contrastive learning in unsupervised paradigm, we apply the contrastive loss in a supervised manner and re-design the loss function to cast off the stereotype of unsupervised learning (e.g., imbalance of positives and negatives, confusion of anchors computing). To this end, we propose Positive-Negative Equal contrastive loss (PNE loss), which increases the latent impact of positive embedding on the anchor and treats the positive as well as negative sample pairs equally. The PNE loss can be directly plugged right into existing semantic segmentation frameworks and leads to excellent performance with neglectable extra computational costs. We utilize a number of classic segmentation methods (e.g., DeepLabV3, OCRNet, UperNet) and backbone (e.g., ResNet, HRNet, Swin Transformer) to conduct comprehensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets (e.g., Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff). Our code will be publicly available soon.      
### 19.Disentangling Random and Cyclic Effects in Time-Lapse Sequences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01413.pdf)
>  Time-lapse image sequences offer visually compelling insights into dynamic processes that are too slow to observe in real time. However, playing a long time-lapse sequence back as a video often results in distracting flicker due to random effects, such as weather, as well as cyclic effects, such as the day-night cycle. We introduce the problem of disentangling time-lapse sequences in a way that allows separate, after-the-fact control of overall trends, cyclic effects, and random effects in the images, and describe a technique based on data-driven generative models that achieves this goal. This enables us to "re-render" the sequences in ways that would not be possible with the input images alone. For example, we can stabilize a long sequence to focus on plant growth over many months, under selectable, consistent weather. <br>Our approach is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) that are conditioned with the time coordinate of the time-lapse sequence. Our architecture and training procedure are designed so that the networks learn to model random variations, such as weather, using the GAN's latent space, and to disentangle overall trends and cyclic variations by feeding the conditioning time label to the model using Fourier features with specific frequencies. <br>We show that our models are robust to defects in the training data, enabling us to amend some of the practical difficulties in capturing long time-lapse sequences, such as temporary occlusions, uneven frame spacing, and missing frames.      
### 20.Vehicle Trajectory Prediction on Highways Using Bird Eye View Representations and Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01407.pdf)
>  This work presents a novel method for predicting vehicle trajectories in highway scenarios using efficient bird's eye view representations and convolutional neural networks. Vehicle positions, motion histories, road configuration, and vehicle interactions are easily included in the prediction model using basic visual representations. The U-net model has been selected as the prediction kernel to generate future visual representations of the scene using an image-to-image regression approach. A method has been implemented to extract vehicle positions from the generated graphical representations to achieve subpixel resolution. The method has been trained and evaluated using the PREVENTION dataset, an on-board sensor dataset. Different network configurations and scene representations have been evaluated. This study found that U-net with 6 depth levels using a linear terminal layer and a Gaussian representation of the vehicles is the best performing configuration. The use of lane markings was found to produce no improvement in prediction performance. The average prediction error is 0.47 and 0.38 meters and the final prediction error is 0.76 and 0.53 meters for longitudinal and lateral coordinates, respectively, for a predicted trajectory length of 2.0 seconds. The prediction error is up to 50% lower compared to the baseline method.      
### 21.I-ViT: Integer-only Quantization for Efficient Vision Transformer Inference  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01405.pdf)
>  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision applications. These models, however, have considerable storage and computational overheads, making their deployment and efficient inference on edge devices challenging. Quantization is a promising approach to reducing model complexity; unfortunately, existing efforts to quantize ViTs are simulated quantization (aka fake quantization), which remains floating-point arithmetic during inference and thus contributes little to model acceleration. In this paper, we propose I-ViT, an integer-only quantization scheme for ViTs, to enable ViTs to perform the entire computational graph of inference with integer operations and bit-shifting and no floating-point operations. In I-ViT, linear operations (e.g., MatMul and Dense) follow the integer-only pipeline with dyadic arithmetic, and non-linear operations (e.g., Softmax, GELU, and LayerNorm) are approximated by the proposed light-weight integer-only arithmetic methods. In particular, I-ViT applies the proposed Shiftmax and ShiftGELU, which are designed to use integer bit-shifting to approximate the corresponding floating-point operations. We evaluate I-ViT on various benchmark models and the results show that integer-only INT8 quantization achieves comparable (or even higher) accuracy to the full-precision (FP) baseline. Furthermore, we utilize TVM for practical hardware deployment on the GPU's integer arithmetic units, achieving 3.72~4.11$\times$ inference speedup compared to the FP model.      
### 22.Large-scale Robustness Analysis of Video Action Recognition Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01398.pdf)
>  We have seen a great progress in video action recognition in recent years. There are several models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with some recent transformer based approaches which provide state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmark datasets. However, large-scale robustness has not been studied for these models which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In this work we perform a large-scale robustness analysis of these existing models for video action recognition. We mainly focus on robustness against distribution shifts due to real-world perturbations instead of adversarial perturbations. We propose four different benchmark datasets, HMDB-51P, UCF-101P, Kinetics-400P, and SSv2P and study the robustness of six different state-of-the-art action recognition models against 90 different perturbations. The study reveals some interesting findings, 1) transformer based models are consistently more robust against most of the perturbations when compared with CNN based models, 2) Pretraining helps Transformer based models to be more robust to different perturbations than CNN based models, and 3) All of the studied models are robust to temporal perturbation on the Kinetics dataset, but not on SSv2; this suggests temporal information is much more important for action label prediction on SSv2 datasets than on the Kinetics dataset. We hope that this study will serve as a benchmark for future research in robust video action recognition.

### 23.Memory Efficient Patch-based Training for INR-based GANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01395.pdf)
>  Recent studies have shown remarkable progress in GANs based on implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that produces an RGB value given its (x, y) coordinate. They represent an image as a continuous version of the underlying 2D signal instead of a 2D array of pixels, which opens new horizons for GAN applications (e.g., zero-shot super-resolution, image outpainting). However, training existing approaches require a heavy computational cost proportional to the image resolution, since they compute an MLP operation for every (x, y) coordinate. To alleviate this issue, we propose a multi-stage patch-based training, a novel and scalable approach that can train INR-based GANs with a flexible computational cost regardless of the image resolution. Specifically, our method allows to generate and discriminate by patch to learn the local details of the image and learn global structural information by a novel reconstruction loss to enable efficient GAN training. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances baseline models in GPU memory while maintaining FIDs at a reasonable level.      
### 24.BiTAT: Neural Network Binarization with Task-dependent Aggregated Transformation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01394.pdf)
>  Neural network quantization aims to transform high-precision weights and activations of a given neural network into low-precision weights/activations for reduced memory usage and computation, while preserving the performance of the original model. However, extreme quantization (1-bit weight/1-bit activations) of compactly-designed backbone architectures (e.g., MobileNets) often used for edge-device deployments results in severe performance degeneration. This paper proposes a novel Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that can effectively alleviate performance degeneration even with extreme quantization by focusing on the inter-weight dependencies, between the weights within each layer and across consecutive layers. To minimize the quantization impact of each weight on others, we perform an orthonormal transformation of the weights at each layer by training an input-dependent correlation matrix and importance vector, such that each weight is disentangled from the others. Then, we quantize the weights based on their importance to minimize the loss of the information from the original weights/activations. We further perform progressive layer-wise quantization from the bottom layer to the top, so that quantization at each layer reflects the quantized distributions of weights and activations at previous layers. We validate the effectiveness of our method on various benchmark datasets against strong neural quantization baselines, demonstrating that it alleviates the performance degeneration on ImageNet and successfully preserves the full-precision model performance on CIFAR-100 with compact backbone networks.      
### 25.GAN-based generation of realistic 3D data: A systematic review and taxonomy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01390.pdf)
>  Data has become the most valuable resource in today's world. With the massive proliferation of data-driven algorithms, such as deep learning-based approaches, the availability of data is of great interest. In this context, high-quality training, validation and testing datasets are particularly needed. Volumetric data is a very important resource in medicine, as it ranges from disease diagnoses to therapy monitoring. When the dataset is sufficient, models can be trained to help doctors with these tasks. Unfortunately, there are scenarios and applications where large amounts of data is unavailable. For example, in the medical field, rare diseases and privacy issues can lead to restricted data availability. In non-medical fields, the high cost of obtaining a sufficient amount of high-quality data can also be a concern. A solution to these problems can be the generation of synthetic data to perform data augmentation in combination with other more traditional methods of data augmentation. Therefore, most of the publications on 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are within the medical domain. The existence of mechanisms to generate realistic synthetic data is a good asset to overcome this challenge, especially in healthcare, as the data must be of good quality and close to reality, i.e. realistic, and without privacy issues. In this review, we provide a summary of works that generate realistic 3D synthetic data using GANs. We therefore outline GAN-based methods in these areas with common architectures, advantages and disadvantages. We present a novel taxonomy, evaluations, challenges and research opportunities to provide a holistic overview of the current state of GANs in medicine and other fields.      
### 26.Learning Disentangled Representations for Controllable Human Motion Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01388.pdf)
>  Generative model-based motion prediction techniques have recently realized predicting controlled human motions, such as predicting multiple upper human body motions with similar lower-body motions. However, to achieve this, the state-of-the-art methods require either subsequently learning mapping functions to seek similar motions or training the model repetitively to enable control over the desired portion of body. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn disentangled representations for controllable human motion prediction. Our network involves a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) architecture to model full-body human motion, and an extra CVAE path to learn only the corresponding partial-body (e.g., lower-body) motion. Specifically, the inductive bias imposed by the extra CVAE path encourages two latent variables in two paths to respectively govern separate representations for each partial-body motion. With a single training, our model is able to provide two types of controls for the generated human motions: (i) strictly controlling one portion of human body and (ii) adaptively controlling the other portion, by sampling from a pair of latent spaces. Additionally, we extend and adapt a sampling strategy to our trained model to diversify the controllable predictions. Our framework also potentially allows new forms of control by flexibly customizing the input for the extra CVAE path. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach is capable of predicting state-of-the-art controllable human motions both qualitatively and quantitatively.      
### 27.Detection of ADHD based on Eye Movements during Natural Viewing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01377.pdf)
>  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly prevalent and requires clinical specialists to diagnose. It is known that an individual's viewing behavior, reflected in their eye movements, is directly related to attentional mechanisms and higher-order cognitive processes. We therefore explore whether ADHD can be detected based on recorded eye movements together with information about the video stimulus in a free-viewing task. To this end, we develop an end-to-end deep learning-based sequence model which we pre-train on a related task for which more data are available. We find that the method is in fact able to detect ADHD and outperforms relevant baselines. We investigate the relevance of the input features in an ablation study. Interestingly, we find that the model's performance is closely related to the content of the video, which provides insights for future experimental designs.      
### 28.Task Discrepancy Maximization for Fine-grained Few-Shot Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01376.pdf)
>  Recognizing discriminative details such as eyes and beaks is important for distinguishing fine-grained classes since they have similar overall appearances. In this regard, we introduce Task Discrepancy Maximization (TDM), a simple module for fine-grained few-shot classification. Our objective is to localize the class-wise discriminative regions by highlighting channels encoding distinct information of the class. Specifically, TDM learns task-specific channel weights based on two novel components: Support Attention Module (SAM) and Query Attention Module (QAM). SAM produces a support weight to represent channel-wise discriminative power for each class. Still, since the SAM is basically only based on the labeled support sets, it can be vulnerable to bias toward such support set. Therefore, we propose QAM which complements SAM by yielding a query weight that grants more weight to object-relevant channels for a given query image. By combining these two weights, a class-wise task-specific channel weight is defined. The weights are then applied to produce task-adaptive feature maps more focusing on the discriminative details. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of TDM and its complementary benefits with prior methods in fine-grained few-shot classification.      
### 29.GraphVid: It Only Takes a Few Nodes to Understand a Video  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01375.pdf)
>  We propose a concise representation of videos that encode perceptually meaningful features into graphs. With this representation, we aim to leverage the large amount of redundancies in videos and save computations. First, we construct superpixel-based graph representations of videos by considering superpixels as graph nodes and create spatial and temporal connections between adjacent superpixels. Then, we leverage Graph Convolutional Networks to process this representation and predict the desired output. As a result, we are able to train models with much fewer parameters, which translates into short training periods and a reduction in computation resource requirements. A comprehensive experimental study on the publicly available datasets Kinetics-400 and Charades shows that the proposed method is highly cost-effective and uses limited commodity hardware during training and inference. It reduces the computational requirements 10-fold while achieving results that are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We believe that the proposed approach is a promising direction that could open the door to solving video understanding more efficiently and enable more resource limited users to thrive in this research field.      
### 30.PVDD: A Practical Video Denoising Dataset with Real-World Dynamic Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01356.pdf)
>  To facilitate video denoising research, we construct a compelling dataset, namely, "Practical Video Denoising Dataset" (PVDD), containing 200 noisy-clean dynamic video pairs in both sRGB and RAW format. Compared with existing datasets consisting of limited motion information, PVDD covers dynamic scenes with varying and natural motion. Different from datasets using primary Gaussian or Poisson distributions to synthesize noise in the sRGB domain, PVDD synthesizes realistic noise from the RAW domain with a physically meaningful sensor noise model followed by ISP processing. Moreover, based on this dataset, we propose a shuffle-based practical degradation model to enhance the performance of video denoising networks on real-world sRGB videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on PVDD achieve superior denoising performance on many challenging real-world videos than on models trained on other existing datasets.      
### 31.Explore Faster Localization Learning For Scene Text Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01342.pdf)
>  Generally pre-training and long-time training computation are necessary for obtaining a good-performance text detector based on deep networks. In this paper, we present a new scene text detection network (called FANet) with a Fast convergence speed and Accurate text localization. The proposed FANet is an end-to-end text detector based on transformer feature learning and normalized Fourier descriptor modeling, where the Fourier Descriptor Proposal Network and Iterative Text Decoding Network are designed to efficiently and accurately identify text proposals. Additionally, a Dense Matching Strategy and a well-designed loss function are also proposed for optimizing the network performance. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed FANet can achieve the SOTA performance with fewer training epochs and no pre-training. When we introduce additional data for pre-training, the proposed FANet can achieve SOTA performance on MSRATD500, CTW1500 and TotalText. The ablation experiments also verify the effectiveness of our contributions.      
### 32.Accurate Instance-Level CAD Model Retrieval in a Large-Scale Database  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01339.pdf)
>  We present a new solution to the fine-grained retrieval of clean CAD models from a large-scale database in order to recover detailed object shape geometries for RGBD scans. Unlike previous work simply indexing into a moderately small database using an object shape descriptor and accepting the top retrieval result, we argue that in the case of a large-scale database a more accurate model may be found within a neighborhood of the descriptor. More importantly, we propose that the distinctiveness deficiency of shape descriptors at the instance level can be compensated by a geometry-based re-ranking of its neighborhood. Our approach first leverages the discriminative power of learned representations to distinguish between different categories of models and then uses a novel robust point set distance metric to re-rank the CAD neighborhood, enabling fine-grained retrieval in a large shape database. Evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that our geometry-based re-ranking is a conceptually simple but highly effective method that can lead to a significant improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.      
### 33.Egocentric Video-Language Pretraining @ EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Multi-Instance Retrieval Challenge 2022  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01334.pdf)
>  In this report, we propose a video-language pretraining (VLP) based solution \cite{kevin2022egovlp} for the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Multi-Instance Retrieval (MIR) challenge. Especially, we exploit the recently released Ego4D dataset \cite{grauman2021ego4d} to pioneer Egocentric VLP from pretraining dataset, pretraining objective, and development set. Based on the above three designs, we develop a pretrained video-language model that is able to transfer its egocentric video-text representation to MIR benchmark. Furthermore, we devise an adaptive multi-instance max-margin loss to effectively fine-tune the model and equip the dual-softmax technique for reliable inference. Our best single model obtains strong performance on the challenge test set with 47.39% mAP and 61.44% nDCG.

### 34.Improving Nighttime Driving-Scene Segmentation via Dual Image-adaptive Learnable Filters  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01331.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation on driving-scene images is vital for autonomous driving. Although encouraging performance has been achieved on daytime images, the performance on nighttime images are less satisfactory due to the insufficient exposure and the lack of labeled data. To address these issues, we present an add-on module called dual image-adaptive learnable filters (DIAL-Filters) to improve the semantic segmentation in nighttime driving conditions, aiming at exploiting the intrinsic features of driving-scene images under different illuminations. DIAL-Filters consist of two parts, including an image-adaptive processing module (IAPM) and a learnable guided filter (LGF). With DIAL-Filters, we design both unsupervised and supervised frameworks for nighttime driving-scene segmentation, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the IAPM module consists of a small convolutional neural network with a set of differentiable image filters, where each image can be adaptively enhanced for better segmentation with respect to the different illuminations. The LGF is employed to enhance the output of segmentation network to get the final segmentation result. The DIAL-Filters are light-weight and efficient and they can be readily applied for both daytime and nighttime images. Our experiments show that DAIL-Filters can significantly improve the supervised segmentation performance on ACDC_Night and NightCity datasets, while it demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised nighttime semantic segmentation on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving testbeds.      
### 35.DUET: Cross-modal Semantic Grounding for Contrastive Zero-shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01328.pdf)
>  Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to predict unseen classes whose samples have never appeared during training, often utilizing additional semantic information (a.k.a. side information) to bridge the training (seen) classes and the unseen classes. One of the most effective and widely used semantic information for zero-shot image classification are attributes which are annotations for class-level visual characteristics. However, due to the shortage of fine-grained annotations, the attribute imbalance and co-occurrence, the current methods often fail to discriminate those subtle visual distinctions between images, which limits their performances. In this paper, we present a transformer-based end-to-end ZSL method named DUET, which integrates latent semantic knowledge from the pretrained language models (PLMs) via a self-supervised multi-modal learning paradigm. Specifically, we (1) developed a cross-modal semantic grounding network to investigate the model's capability of disentangling semantic attributes from the images, (2) applied an attribute-level contrastive learning strategy to further enhance the model's discrimination on fine-grained visual characteristics against the attribute co-occurrence and imbalance, and (3) proposed a multi-task learning policy for considering multi-model objectives. With extensive experiments on three standard ZSL benchmarks and a knowledge graph equipped ZSL benchmark, we find that DUET can often achieve state-of-the-art performance, its components are effective and its predictions are interpretable.      
### 36.Computer vision application for improved product traceability in the granite manufacturing industry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01323.pdf)
>  The traceability of granite blocks consists in identifying each block with a finite number of color bands which represent a numerical code. This code has to be read several times throughout the manufacturing process, but its accuracy is subject to human errors, leading to cause faults in the traceability system. A computer vision system is presented to address this problem through color detection and the decryption of the associated code. The system developed makes use of color space transformations, and several thresholds for the isolation of the colors. Computer vision methods are implemented, along with contour detection procedures for color identification. Lastly, the analysis of geometrical features is used to decrypt the color code captured. The proposed algorithm is trained on a set of 109 pictures taken in different environmental conditions and validated on a set of 21 images. The outcome shows promising results with an accuracy rate of 75.00% in the validation process. Therefore, the application presented can help employees reduce the number of mistakes on product tracking.      
### 37.Harmonizer: Learning to Perform White-Box Image and Video Harmonization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01322.pdf)
>  Recent works on image harmonization solve the problem as a pixel-wise image translation task via large autoencoders. They have unsatisfactory performances and slow inference speeds when dealing with high-resolution images. In this work, we observe that adjusting the input arguments of basic image filters, e.g., brightness and contrast, is sufficient for humans to produce realistic images from the composite ones. Hence, we frame image harmonization as an image-level regression problem to learn the arguments of the filters that humans use for the task. We present a Harmonizer framework for image harmonization. Unlike prior methods that are based on black-box autoencoders, Harmonizer contains a neural network for filter argument prediction and several white-box filters (based on the predicted arguments) for image harmonization. We also introduce a cascade regressor and a dynamic loss strategy for Harmonizer to learn filter arguments more stably and precisely. Since our network only outputs image-level arguments and the filters we used are efficient, Harmonizer is much lighter and faster than existing methods. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Harmonizer surpasses existing methods notably, especially with high-resolution inputs. Finally, we apply Harmonizer to video harmonization, which achieves consistent results across frames and 56 fps at 1080P resolution.

### 38.Transferring Textual Knowledge for Visual Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01297.pdf)
>  Transferring knowledge from task-agnostic pre-trained deep models for downstream tasks is an important topic in computer vision research. Along with the growth of computational capacity, we now have open-source Vision-Language pre-trained models in large scales of the model architecture and amount of data. In this study, we focus on transferring knowledge for vision classification tasks. Conventional methods randomly initialize the linear classifier head for vision classification, but they leave the usage of the text encoder for downstream visual recognition tasks undiscovered. In this paper, we revise the role of the linear classifier and replace the classifier with the embedded language representations of the object categories. These language representations are initialized from the text encoder of the vision-language pre-trained model to further utilize its well-pretrained language model parameters. The empirical study shows that our method improves both the performance and the training speed of video classification, with a negligible change in the model. In particular, our paradigm achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 87.3% on Kinetics-400.      
### 39.Real Time Egocentric Segmentation for Video-self Avatar in Mixed Reality  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01296.pdf)
>  In this work we present our real-time egocentric body segmentation algorithm. Our algorithm achieves a frame rate of 66 fps for an input resolution of 640x480, thanks to our shallow network inspired in Thundernet's architecture. Besides, we put a strong emphasis on the variability of the training data. More concretely, we describe the creation process of our Egocentric Bodies (EgoBodies) dataset, composed of almost 10,000 images from three datasets, created both from synthetic methods and real capturing. We conduct experiments to understand the contribution of the individual datasets; compare Thundernet model trained with EgoBodies with simpler and more complex previous approaches and discuss their corresponding performance in a real-life setup in terms of segmentation quality and inference times. The described trained semantic segmentation algorithm is already integrated in an end-to-end system for Mixed Reality (MR), making it possible for users to see his/her own body while being immersed in a MR scene.      
### 40.Game State Learning via Game Scene Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01289.pdf)
>  Having access to accurate game state information is of utmost importance for any game artificial intelligence task including game-playing, testing, player modeling, and procedural content generation. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques have shown to be capable of inferring accurate game state information from the high-dimensional pixel input of game's rendering into compressed latent representations. Contrastive Learning is one such popular paradigm of SSL where the visual understanding of the game's images comes from contrasting dissimilar and similar game states defined by simple image augmentation methods. In this study, we introduce a new game scene augmentation technique -- named GameCLR -- that takes advantage of the game-engine to define and synthesize specific, highly-controlled renderings of different game states, thereby, boosting contrastive learning performance. We test our GameCLR contrastive learning technique on images of the CARLA driving simulator environment and compare it against the popular SimCLR baseline SSL method. Our results suggest that GameCLR can infer the game's state information from game footage more accurately compared to the baseline. The introduced approach allows us to conduct game artificial intelligence research by directly utilizing screen pixels as input.      
### 41.FlowNAS: Neural Architecture Search for Optical Flow Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01271.pdf)
>  Existing optical flow estimators usually employ the network architectures typically designed for image classification as the encoder to extract per-pixel features. However, due to the natural difference between the tasks, the architectures designed for image classification may be sub-optimal for flow estimation. To address this issue, we propose a neural architecture search method named FlowNAS to automatically find the better encoder architecture for flow estimation task. We first design a suitable search space including various convolutional operators and construct a weight-sharing super-network for efficiently evaluating the candidate architectures. Then, for better training the super-network, we propose Feature Alignment Distillation, which utilizes a well-trained flow estimator to guide the training of super-network. Finally, a resource-constrained evolutionary algorithm is exploited to find an optimal architecture (i.e., sub-network). Experimental results show that the discovered architecture with the weights inherited from the super-network achieves 4.67\% F1-all error on KITTI, an 8.4\% reduction of RAFT baseline, surpassing state-of-the-art handcrafted models GMA and AGFlow, while reducing the model complexity and latency. The source code and trained models will be released in <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/VDIGPKU/FlowNAS" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 42.OS-MSL: One Stage Multimodal Sequential Link Framework for Scene Segmentation and Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01241.pdf)
>  Scene segmentation and classification (SSC) serve as a critical step towards the field of video structuring analysis. Intuitively, jointly learning of these two tasks can promote each other by sharing common information. However, scene segmentation concerns more on the local difference between adjacent shots while classification needs the global representation of scene segments, which probably leads to the model dominated by one of the two tasks in the training phase. In this paper, from an alternate perspective to overcome the above challenges, we unite these two tasks into one task by a new form of predicting shots link: a link connects two adjacent shots, indicating that they belong to the same scene or category. To the end, we propose a general One Stage Multimodal Sequential Link Framework (OS-MSL) to both distinguish and leverage the two-fold semantics by reforming the two learning tasks into a unified one. Furthermore, we tailor a specific module called DiffCorrNet to explicitly extract the information of differences and correlations among shots. Extensive experiments on a brand-new large scale dataset collected from real-world applications, and MovieScenes are conducted. Both the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method against strong baselines.      
### 43.Domain Adaptive Nuclei Instance Segmentation and Classification via Category-aware Feature Alignment and Pseudo-labelling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01233.pdf)
>  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been broadly utilized to improve the models' adaptation ability in general computer vision. However, different from the natural images, there exist huge semantic gaps for the nuclei from different categories in histopathology images. It is still under-explored how could we build generalized UDA models for precise segmentation or classification of nuclei instances across different datasets. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network, namely Category-Aware feature alignment and Pseudo-Labelling Network (CAPL-Net) for UDA nuclei instance segmentation and classification. Specifically, we first propose a category-level feature alignment module with dynamic learnable trade-off weights. Second, we propose to facilitate the model performance on the target data via self-supervised training with pseudo labels based on nuclei-level prototype features. Comprehensive experiments on cross-domain nuclei instance segmentation and classification tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods with a remarkable margin.      
### 44.Segmentation Guided Deep HDR Deghosting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01229.pdf)
>  We present a motion segmentation guided convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for high dynamic range (HDR) image deghosting. First, we segment the moving regions in the input sequence using a CNN. Then, we merge static and moving regions separately with different fusion networks and combine fused features to generate the final ghost-free HDR image. Our motion segmentation guided HDR fusion approach offers significant advantages over existing HDR deghosting methods. First, by segmenting the input sequence into static and moving regions, our proposed approach learns effective fusion rules for various challenging saturation and motion types. Second, we introduce a novel memory network that accumulates the necessary features required to generate plausible details in the saturated regions. The proposed method outperforms nine existing state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets and generates visually pleasing ghost-free HDR results. We also present a large-scale motion segmentation dataset of 3683 varying exposure images to benefit the research community.      
### 45.A Survey on Label-efficient Deep Segmentation: Bridging the Gap between Weak Supervision and Dense Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01223.pdf)
>  The rapid development of deep learning has made a great progress in segmentation, one of the fundamental tasks of computer vision. However, the current segmentation algorithms mostly rely on the availability of pixel-level annotations, which are often expensive, tedious, and laborious. To alleviate this burden, the past years have witnessed an increasing attention in building label-efficient, deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms. This paper offers a comprehensive review on label-efficient segmentation methods. To this end, we first develop a taxonomy to organize these methods according to the supervision provided by different types of weak labels (including no supervision, coarse supervision, incomplete supervision and noisy supervision) and supplemented by the types of segmentation problems (including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation). Next, we summarize the existing label-efficient segmentation methods from a unified perspective that discusses an important question: how to bridge the gap between weak supervision and dense prediction -- the current methods are mostly based on heuristic priors, such as cross-pixel similarity, cross-label constraint, cross-view consistency, cross-image relation, etc. Finally, we share our opinions about the future research directions for label-efficient deep segmentation.      
### 46.BusiNet -- a Light and Fast Text Detection Network for Business Documents  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01220.pdf)
>  For digitizing or indexing physical documents, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the process of extracting textual information from scanned documents, is a vital technology. When a document is visually damaged or contains non-textual elements, existing technologies can yield poor results, as erroneous detection results can greatly affect the quality of OCR. In this paper we present a detection network dubbed BusiNet aimed at OCR of business documents. Business documents often include sensitive information and as such they cannot be uploaded to a cloud service for OCR. BusiNet was designed to be fast and light so it could run locally preventing privacy issues. Furthermore, BusiNet is built to handle scanned document corruption and noise using a specialized synthetic dataset. The model is made robust to unseen noise by employing adversarial training strategies. We perform an evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrating the usefulness and broad applicability of our model.      
### 47.Solutions for Fine-grained and Long-tailed Snake Species Recognition in SnakeCLEF 2022  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01216.pdf)
>  Automatic snake species recognition is important because it has vast potential to help lower deaths and disabilities caused by snakebites. We introduce our solution in SnakeCLEF 2022 for fine-grained snake species recognition on a heavy long-tailed class distribution. First, a network architecture is designed to extract and fuse features from multiple modalities, i.e. photograph from visual modality and geographic locality information from language modality. Then, logit adjustment based methods are studied to relieve the impact caused by the severe class imbalance. Next, a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning method is proposed to make full use of the dataset, including both labeled training data and unlabeled testing data. Finally, post processing strategies, such as multi-scale and multi-crop test-time-augmentation, location filtering and model ensemble, are employed for better performance. With an ensemble of several different models, a private score 82.65%, ranking the 3rd, is achieved on the final leaderboard.      
### 48.Attributed Abnormality Graph Embedding for Clinically Accurate X-Ray Report Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01208.pdf)
>  Automatic generation of medical reports from X-ray images can assist radiologists to perform the time-consuming and yet important reporting task. Yet, achieving clinically accurate generated reports remains challenging. Modeling the underlying abnormalities using the knowledge graph approach has been found promising in enhancing the clinical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel fined-grained knowledge graph structure called an attributed abnormality graph (ATAG). The ATAG consists of interconnected abnormality nodes and attribute nodes, allowing it to better capture the abnormality details. In contrast to the existing methods where the abnormality graph was constructed manually, we propose a methodology to automatically construct the fine-grained graph structure based on annotations, medical reports in X-ray datasets, and the RadLex radiology lexicon. We then learn the ATAG embedding using a deep model with an encoder-decoder architecture for the report generation. In particular, graph attention networks are explored to encode the relationships among the abnormalities and their attributes. A gating mechanism is adopted and integrated with various decoders for the generation. We carry out extensive experiments based on the benchmark datasets, and show that the proposed ATAG-based deep model outperforms the SOTA methods by a large margin and can improve the clinical accuracy of the generated reports.      
### 49.Adversarial Pairwise Reverse Attention for Camera Performance Imbalance in Person Re-identification: New Dataset and Metrics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01204.pdf)
>  Existing evaluation metrics for Person Re-Identification (Person ReID) models focus on system-wide performance. However, our studies reveal weaknesses due to the uneven data distributions among cameras and different camera properties that expose the ReID system to exploitation. In this work, we raise the long-ignored ReID problem of camera performance imbalance and collect a real-world privacy-aware dataset from 38 cameras to assist the study of the imbalance issue. We propose new metrics to quantify camera performance imbalance and further propose the Adversarial Pairwise Reverse Attention (APRA) Module to guide the model learning the camera invariant feature with a novel pairwise attention inversion mechanism.      
### 50.R^2VOS: Robust Referring Video Object Segmentation via Relational Multimodal Cycle Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01203.pdf)
>  Referring video object segmentation (R-VOS) aims to segment the object masks in a video given a referring linguistic expression to the object. It is a recently introduced task attracting growing research attention. However, all existing works make a strong assumption: The object depicted by the expression must exist in the video, namely, the expression and video must have an object-level semantic consensus. This is often violated in real-world applications where an expression can be queried to false videos, and existing methods always fail in such false queries due to abusing the assumption. In this work, we emphasize that studying semantic consensus is necessary to improve the robustness of R-VOS. Accordingly, we pose an extended task from R-VOS without the semantic consensus assumption, named Robust R-VOS ($\mathrm{R}^2$-VOS). The $\mathrm{R}^2$-VOS task is essentially related to the joint modeling of the primary R-VOS task and its dual problem (text reconstruction). We embrace the observation that the embedding spaces have relational consistency through the cycle of text-video-text transformation, which connects the primary and dual problems. We leverage the cycle consistency to discriminate the semantic consensus, thus advancing the primary task. Parallel optimization of the primary and dual problems are enabled by introducing an early grounding medium. A new evaluation dataset, $\mathrm{R}^2$-Youtube-VOS, is collected to measure the robustness of R-VOS models against unpaired videos and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only identifies negative pairs of unrelated expressions and videos, but also improves the segmentation accuracy for positive pairs with a superior disambiguating ability. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Ref-DAVIS17, Ref-Youtube-VOS, and the novel $\mathrm{R}^2$-Youtube-VOS dataset.      
### 51.S$^{5}$Mars: Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Learning for Mars Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01200.pdf)
>  Deep learning has become a powerful tool for Mars exploration. Mars terrain segmentation is an important Martian vision task, which is the base of rover autonomous planning and safe driving. However, existing deep-learning-based terrain segmentation methods face two problems: one is the lack of sufficient detailed and high-confidence annotations, and the other is the over-reliance of models on annotated training data. In this paper, we address these two problems from the perspective of joint data and method design. We first present a new Mars terrain segmentation dataset which contains 6K high-resolution images and is sparsely annotated based on confidence, ensuring the high quality of labels. Then to learn from this sparse data, we propose a representation-learning-based framework for Mars terrain segmentation, including a self-supervised learning stage (for pre-training) and a semi-supervised learning stage (for fine-tuning). Specifically, for self-supervised learning, we design a multi-task mechanism based on the masked image modeling (MIM) concept to emphasize the texture information of images. For semi-supervised learning, since our dataset is sparsely annotated, we encourage the model to excavate the information of unlabeled area in each image by generating and utilizing pseudo-labels online. We name our dataset and method Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Segmentation for Mars (S$^{5}$Mars). Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art approaches and improve terrain segmentation performance by a large margin.      
### 52.Identifying Rhythmic Patterns for Face Forgery Detection and Categorization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01199.pdf)
>  With the emergence of GAN, face forgery technologies have been heavily abused. Achieving accurate face forgery detection is imminent. Inspired by remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) that PPG signal corresponds to the periodic change of skin color caused by heartbeat in face videos, we observe that despite the inevitable loss of PPG signal during the forgery process, there is still a mixture of PPG signals in the forgery video with a unique rhythmic pattern depending on its generation method. Motivated by this key observation, we propose a framework for face forgery detection and categorization consisting of: 1) a Spatial-Temporal Filtering Network (STFNet) for PPG signals filtering, and 2) a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Network (STINet) for constraint and interaction of PPG signals. Moreover, with insight into the generation of forgery methods, we further propose intra-source and inter-source blending to boost the performance of the framework. Overall, extensive experiments have proved the superiority of our method.      
### 53.Fast Vehicle Detection and Tracking on Fisheye Traffic Monitoring Video using CNN and Bounding Box Propagation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01183.pdf)
>  We design a fast car detection and tracking algorithm for traffic monitoring fisheye video mounted on crossroads. We use ICIP 2020 VIP Cup dataset and adopt YOLOv5 as the object detection base model. The nighttime video of this dataset is very challenging, and the detection accuracy (AP50) of the base model is about 54%. We design a reliable car detection and tracking algorithm based on the concept of bounding box propagation among frames, which provides 17.9 percentage points (pp) and 7 pp accuracy improvement over the base model for the nighttime and daytime videos, respectively. To speed up, the grayscale frame difference is used for the intermediate frames in a segment, which can double the processing speed.      
### 54.Enhancing Local Geometry Learning for 3D Point Cloud via Decoupling Convolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01181.pdf)
>  Modeling the local surface geometry is challenging in 3D point cloud understanding due to the lack of connectivity information. Most prior works model local geometry using various convolution operations. We observe that the convolution can be equivalently decomposed as a weighted combination of a local and a global component. With this observation, we explicitly decouple these two components so that the local one can be enhanced and facilitate the learning of local surface geometry. Specifically, we propose Laplacian Unit (LU), a simple yet effective architectural unit that can enhance the learning of local geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that networks equipped with LUs achieve competitive or superior performance on typical point cloud understanding tasks. Moreover, through establishing connections between the mean curvature flow, a further investigation of LU based on curvatures is made to interpret the adaptive smoothing and sharpening effect of LU. The code will be available.      
### 55.Enhancing Local Feature Learning Using Diffusion for 3D Point Cloud Understanding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01174.pdf)
>  Learning point clouds is challenging due to the lack of connectivity information, i.e., edges. Although existing edge-aware methods can improve the performance by modeling edges, how edges contribute to the improvement is unclear. In this study, we propose a method that automatically learns to enhance/suppress edges while keeping the its working mechanism clear. First, we theoretically figure out how edge enhancement/suppression works. Second, we experimentally verify the edge enhancement/suppression behavior. Third, we empirically show that this behavior improves performance. In general, we observe that the proposed method achieves competitive performance in point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.      
### 56.TANet: Transformer-based Asymmetric Network for RGB-D Salient Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01172.pdf)
>  Existing RGB-D SOD methods mainly rely on a symmetric two-stream CNN-based network to extract RGB and depth channel features separately. However, there are two problems with the symmetric conventional network structure: first, the ability of CNN in learning global contexts is limited; second, the symmetric two-stream structure ignores the inherent differences between modalities. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based asymmetric network (TANet) to tackle the issues mentioned above. We employ the powerful feature extraction capability of Transformer (PVTv2) to extract global semantic information from RGB data and design a lightweight CNN backbone (LWDepthNet) to extract spatial structure information from depth data without pre-training. The asymmetric hybrid encoder (AHE) effectively reduces the number of parameters in the model while increasing speed without sacrificing performance. Then, we design a cross-modal feature fusion module (CMFFM), which enhances and fuses RGB and depth features with each other. Finally, we add edge prediction as an auxiliary task and propose an edge enhancement module (EEM) to generate sharper contours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over 14 state-of-the-art RGB-D methods on six public datasets. Our code will be released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/lc012463/TANet" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 57.Portuguese Man-of-War Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01171.pdf)
>  Portuguese man-of-war (PMW) is a gelatinous organism with long tentacles capable of causing severe burns, thus leading to negative impacts on human activities, such as tourism and fishing. There is a lack of information about the spatio-temporal dynamics of this species. Therefore, the use of alternative methods for collecting data can contribute to their monitoring. Given the widespread use of social networks and the eye-catching look of PMW, Instagram posts can be a promising data source for monitoring. The first task to follow this approach is to identify posts that refer to PMW. This paper reports on the use of convolutional neural networks for PMW images classification, in order to automate the recognition of Instagram posts. We created a suitable dataset, and trained three different neural networks: VGG-16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, with and without a pre-trained step with the ImageNet dataset. We analyzed their results using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. The pre-trained ResNet50 network presented the best results, obtaining 94% of accuracy and 95% of precision, recall, and F1 score. These results show that convolutional neural networks can be very effective for recognizing PMW images from the Instagram social media.      
### 58.Target-absent Human Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01166.pdf)
>  The prediction of human gaze behavior is important for building human-computer interactive systems that can anticipate a user's attention. Computer vision models have been developed to predict the fixations made by people as they search for target objects. But what about when the image has no target? Equally important is to know how people search when they cannot find a target, and when they would stop searching. In this paper, we propose the first data-driven computational model that addresses the search-termination problem and predicts the scanpath of search fixations made by people searching for targets that do not appear in images. We model visual search as an imitation learning problem and represent the internal knowledge that the viewer acquires through fixations using a novel state representation that we call Foveated Feature Maps (FFMs). FFMs integrate a simulated foveated retina into a pretrained ConvNet that produces an in-network feature pyramid, all with minimal computational overhead. Our method integrates FFMs as the state representation in inverse reinforcement learning. Experimentally, we improve the state of the art in predicting human target-absent search behavior on the COCO-Search18 dataset      
### 59.Aug-NeRF: Training Stronger Neural Radiance Fields with Triple-Level Physically-Grounded Augmentations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01164.pdf)
>  Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) regresses a neural parameterized scene by differentially rendering multi-view images with ground-truth supervision. However, when interpolating novel views, NeRF often yields inconsistent and visually non-smooth geometric results, which we consider as a generalization gap between seen and unseen views. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have demonstrated the promise of advanced robust data augmentations, either random or learned, in enhancing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. Inspired by that, we propose Augmented NeRF (Aug-NeRF), which for the first time brings the power of robust data augmentations into regularizing the NeRF training. Particularly, our proposal learns to seamlessly blend worst-case perturbations into three distinct levels of the NeRF pipeline with physical grounds, including (1) the input coordinates, to simulate imprecise camera parameters at image capture; (2) intermediate features, to smoothen the intrinsic feature manifold; and (3) pre-rendering output, to account for the potential degradation factors in the multi-view image supervision. Extensive results demonstrate that Aug-NeRF effectively boosts NeRF performance in both novel view synthesis (up to 1.5dB PSNR gain) and underlying geometry reconstruction. Furthermore, thanks to the implicit smooth prior injected by the triple-level augmentations, Aug-NeRF can even recover scenes from heavily corrupted images, a highly challenging setting untackled before.

### 60.Partial and Asymmetric Contrastive Learning for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Long-Tailed Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01160.pdf)
>  Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods are typically benchmarked on training sets with balanced class distributions. However, in real-world applications, it is common for the training sets to have long-tailed distributions. In this work, we first demonstrate that existing OOD detection methods commonly suffer from significant performance degradation when the training set is long-tail distributed. Through analysis, we posit that this is because the models struggle to distinguish the minority tail-class in-distribution samples, from the true OOD samples, making the tail classes more prone to be falsely detected as OOD. To solve this problem, we propose Partial and Asymmetric Supervised Contrastive Learning (PASCL), which explicitly encourages the model to distinguish between tail-class in-distribution samples and OOD samples. To further boost in-distribution classification accuracy, we propose Auxiliary Branch Finetuning, which uses two separate branches of BN and classification layers for anomaly detection and in-distribution classification, respectively. The intuition is that in-distribution and OOD anomaly data have different underlying distributions. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art method by $1.29\%$, $1.45\%$, $0.69\%$ anomaly detection false positive rate (FPR) and $3.24\%$, $4.06\%$, $7.89\%$ in-distribution classification accuracy on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT, respectively.

### 61.RAF: Recursive Adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition Using Extremely Limited Queries  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01149.pdf)
>  Recent successful adversarial attacks on face recognition show that, despite the remarkable progress of face recognition models, they are still far behind the human intelligence for perception and recognition. It reveals the vulnerability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as state-of-the-art building block for face recognition models against adversarial examples, which can cause certain consequences for secure systems. Gradient-based adversarial attacks are widely studied before and proved to be successful against face recognition models. However, finding the optimized perturbation per each face needs to submitting the significant number of queries to the target model. In this paper, we propose recursive adversarial attack on face recognition using automatic face warping which needs extremely limited number of queries to fool the target model. Instead of a random face warping procedure, the warping functions are applied on specific detected regions of face like eyebrows, nose, lips, etc. We evaluate the robustness of proposed method in the decision-based black-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model parameters and gradients, but hard-label predictions and confidence scores are provided by the target model.      
### 62.ABAW: Learning from Synthetic Data &amp; Multi-Task Learning Challenges  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01138.pdf)
>  This paper describes the fourth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) Competition, held in conjunction with European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022. The 4th ABAW Competition is a continuation of the Competitions held at IEEE CVPR 2022, ICCV 2021, IEEE FG 2020 and IEEE CVPR 2017 Conferences, and aims at automatically analyzing affect. In the previous runs of this Competition, the Challenges targeted Valence-Arousal Estimation, Expression Classification and Action Unit Detection. This year the Competition encompasses two different Challenges: i) a Multi-Task-Learning one in which the goal is to learn at the same time (i.e., in a multi-task learning setting) all the three above mentioned tasks; and ii) a Learning from Synthetic Data one in which the goal is to learn to recognise the basic expressions from artificially generated data and generalise to real data. The Aff-Wild2 database is a large scale in-the-wild database and the first one that contains annotations for valence and arousal, expressions and action units. This database is the basis for the above Challenges. In more detail: i) s-Aff-Wild2 -- a static version of Aff-Wild2 database -- has been constructed and utilized for the purposes of the Multi-Task-Learning Challenge; and ii) some specific frames-images from the Aff-Wild2 database have been used in an expression manipulation manner for creating the synthetic dataset, which is the basis for the Learning from Synthetic Data Challenge. In this paper, at first we present the two Challenges, along with the utilized corpora, then we outline the evaluation metrics and finally present the baseline systems per Challenge, as well as their derived results.

### 63.Beyond Visual Field of View: Perceiving 3D Environment with Echoes and Vision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01136.pdf)
>  This paper focuses on perceiving and navigating 3D environments using echoes and RGB image. In particular, we perform depth estimation by fusing RGB image with echoes, received from multiple orientations. Unlike previous works, we go beyond the field of view of the RGB and estimate dense depth maps for substantially larger parts of the environment. We show that the echoes provide holistic and in-expensive information about the 3D structures complementing the RGB image. Moreover, we study how echoes and the wide field-of-view depth maps can be utilised in robot navigation. We compare the proposed methods against recent baselines using two sets of challenging realistic 3D environments: Replica and Matterport3D. The implementation and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.      
### 64.DecisioNet -- A Binary-Tree Structured Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01127.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) and decision trees (DTs) are both state-of-the-art classifiers. DNNs perform well due to their representational learning capabilities, while DTs are computationally efficient as they perform inference along one route (root-to-leaf) that is dependent on the input data. In this paper, we present DecisioNet (DN), a binary-tree structured neural network. We propose a systematic way to convert an existing DNN into a DN to create a lightweight version of the original model. DecisioNet takes the best of both worlds - it uses neural modules to perform representational learning and utilizes its tree structure to perform only a portion of the computations. We evaluate various DN architectures, along with their corresponding baseline models on the FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets. We show that the DN variants achieve similar accuracy while significantly reducing the computational cost of the original network.      
### 65.Are 3D Face Shapes Expressive Enough for Recognising Continuous Emotions and Action Unit Intensities?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01113.pdf)
>  Recognising continuous emotions and action unit (AU) intensities from face videos requires a spatial and temporal understanding of expression dynamics. Existing works primarily rely on 2D face appearances to extract such dynamics. This work focuses on a promising alternative based on parametric 3D face shape alignment models, which disentangle different factors of variation, including expression-induced shape variations. We aim to understand how expressive 3D face shapes are in estimating valence-arousal and AU intensities compared to the state-of-the-art 2D appearance-based models. We benchmark four recent 3D face alignment models: ExpNet, 3DDFA-V2, DECA, and EMOCA. In valence-arousal estimation, expression features of 3D face models consistently surpassed previous works and yielded an average concordance correlation of .739 and .574 on SEWA and AVEC 2019 CES corpora, respectively. We also study how 3D face shapes performed on AU intensity estimation on BP4D and DISFA datasets, and report that 3D face features were on par with 2D appearance features in AUs 4, 6, 10, 12, and 25, but not the entire set of AUs. To understand this discrepancy, we conduct a correspondence analysis between valence-arousal and AUs, which points out that accurate prediction of valence-arousal may require the knowledge of only a few AUs.      
### 66.Augment to Detect Anomalies with Continuous Labelling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01112.pdf)
>  Anomaly detection is to recognize samples that differ in some respect from the training observations. These samples which do not conform to the distribution of normal data are called outliers or anomalies. In real-world anomaly detection problems, the outliers are absent, not well defined, or have a very limited number of instances. Recent state-of-the-art deep learning-based anomaly detection methods suffer from high computational cost, complexity, unstable training procedures, and non-trivial implementation, making them difficult to deploy in real-world applications. To combat this problem, we leverage a simple learning procedure that trains a lightweight convolutional neural network, reaching state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose to solve anomaly detection as a supervised regression problem. We label normal and anomalous data using two separable distributions of continuous values. To compensate for the unavailability of anomalous samples during training time, we utilize straightforward image augmentation techniques to create a distinct set of samples as anomalies. The distribution of the augmented set is similar but slightly deviated from the normal data, whereas real anomalies are expected to have an even further distribution. Therefore, training a regressor on these augmented samples will result in more separable distributions of labels for normal and real anomalous data points. Anomaly detection experiments on image and video datasets show the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.      
### 67.Anomaly Detection with Adversarially Learned Perturbations of Latent Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01106.pdf)
>  Anomaly detection is to identify samples that do not conform to the distribution of the normal data. Due to the unavailability of anomalous data, training a supervised deep neural network is a cumbersome task. As such, unsupervised methods are preferred as a common approach to solve this task. Deep autoencoders have been broadly adopted as a base of many unsupervised anomaly detection methods. However, a notable shortcoming of deep autoencoders is that they provide insufficient representations for anomaly detection by generalizing to reconstruct outliers. In this work, we have designed an adversarial framework consisting of two competing components, an Adversarial Distorter, and an Autoencoder. The Adversarial Distorter is a convolutional encoder that learns to produce effective perturbations and the autoencoder is a deep convolutional neural network that aims to reconstruct the images from the perturbed latent feature space. The networks are trained with opposing goals in which the Adversarial Distorter produces perturbations that are applied to the encoder's latent feature space to maximize the reconstruction error and the autoencoder tries to neutralize the effect of these perturbations to minimize it. When applied to anomaly detection, the proposed method learns semantically richer representations due to applying perturbations to the feature space. The proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in anomaly detection on image and video datasets.      
### 68.Can Language Understand Depth?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01077.pdf)
>  Besides image classification, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has accomplished extraordinary success for a wide range of vision tasks, including object-level and 3D space understanding. However, it's still challenging to transfer semantic knowledge learned from CLIP into more intricate tasks of quantified targets, such as depth estimation with geometric information. In this paper, we propose to apply CLIP for zero-shot monocular depth estimation, named DepthCLIP. We found that the patches of the input image could respond to a certain semantic distance token and then be projected to a quantified depth bin for coarse estimation. Without any training, our DepthCLIP surpasses existing unsupervised methods and even approaches the early fully-supervised networks. To our best knowledge, we are the first to conduct zero-shot adaptation from the semantic language knowledge to quantified downstream tasks and perform zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We hope our work could cast a light on future research.

### 69.Divert More Attention to Vision-Language Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01076.pdf)
>  Relying on Transformer for complex visual feature learning, object tracking has witnessed the new standard for state-of-the-arts (SOTAs). However, this advancement accompanies by larger training data and longer training period, making tracking increasingly expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Transformer-reliance is not necessary and the pure ConvNets are still competitive and even better yet more economical and friendly in achieving SOTA tracking. Our solution is to unleash the power of multimodal vision-language (VL) tracking, simply using ConvNets. The essence lies in learning novel unified-adaptive VL representations with our modality mixer (ModaMixer) and asymmetrical ConvNet search. We show that our unified-adaptive VL representation, learned purely with the ConvNets, is a simple yet strong alternative to Transformer visual features, by unbelievably improving a CNN-based Siamese tracker by 14.5% in SUC on challenging LaSOT (50.7% &gt; 65.2%), even outperforming several Transformer-based SOTA trackers. Besides empirical results, we theoretically analyze our approach to evidence its effectiveness. By revealing the potential of VL representation, we expect the community to divert more attention to VL tracking and hope to open more possibilities for future tracking beyond Transformer.

### 70.Sub-cluster-aware Network for Few-shot Skin Disease Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01072.pdf)
>  This paper studies the few-shot skin disease classification problem. Based on a crucial observation that skin disease images often exist multiple sub-clusters within a class (i.e., the appearances of images within one class of disease vary and form multiple distinct sub-groups), we design a novel Sub-Cluster-Aware Network, namely SCAN, for rare skin disease diagnosis with enhanced accuracy. As the performance of few-shot learning highly depends on the quality of the learned feature encoder, the main principle guiding the design of SCAN is the intrinsic sub-clustered representation learning for each class so as to better describe feature distributions. Specifically, SCAN follows a dual-branch framework, where the first branch is to learn class-wise features to distinguish different skin diseases, and the second one aims to learn features which can effectively partition each class into several groups so as to preserve the sub-clustered structure within each class. To achieve the objective of the second branch, we present a cluster loss to learn image similarities via unsupervised clustering. To ensure that the samples in each sub-cluster are from the same class, we further design a purity loss to refine the unsupervised clustering results. We evaluate the proposed approach on two public datasets for few-shot skin disease classification. The experimental results validate that our framework outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods by around 2% to 4% on the SD-198 and Derm7pt datasets.      
### 71.You Only Need One Detector: Unified Object Detector for Different Modalities based on Vision Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01071.pdf)
>  Most systems use different models for different modalities, such as one model for processing RGB images and one for depth images. Meanwhile, some recent works discovered that an identical model for one modality can be used for another modality with the help of cross modality transfer learning. In this article, we further find out that by using a vision transformer together with cross/inter modality transfer learning, a unified detector can achieve better performances when using different modalities as inputs. The unified model is useful as we don't need to maintain separate models or weights for robotics, hence, it is more efficient. One application scenario of our unified system for robotics can be: without any model architecture and model weights updating, robotics can switch smoothly on using RGB camera or both RGB and Depth Sensor during the day time and Depth sensor during the night time . <br>Experiments on SUN RGB-D dataset show: Our unified model is not only efficient, but also has a similar or better performance in terms of mAP50 based on SUNRGBD16 category: compare with the RGB only one, ours is slightly worse (52.3 $\to$ 51.9). compare with the point cloud only one, we have similar performance (52.7 $\to$ 52.8); When using the novel inter modality mixing method proposed in this work, our model can achieve a significantly better performance with 3.1 (52.7 $\to$ 55.8) absolute improvement comparing with the previous best result.

### 72.Counterfactually Measuring and Eliminating Social Bias in Vision-Language Pre-training Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01056.pdf)
>  Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in numerous cross-modal tasks. Since they are optimized to capture the statistical properties of intra- and inter-modality, there remains risk to learn social biases presented in the data as well. In this work, we (1) introduce a counterfactual-based bias measurement \emph{CounterBias} to quantify the social bias in VLP models by comparing the [MASK]ed prediction probabilities of factual and counterfactual samples; (2) construct a novel VL-Bias dataset including 24K image-text pairs for measuring gender bias in VLP models, from which we observed that significant gender bias is prevalent in VLP models; and (3) propose a VLP debiasing method \emph{FairVLP} to minimize the difference in the [MASK]ed prediction probabilities between factual and counterfactual image-text pairs for VLP debiasing. Although CounterBias and FairVLP focus on social bias, they are generalizable to serve as tools and provide new insights to probe and regularize more knowledge in VLP models.      
### 73.Exploiting Context Information for Generic Event Boundary Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01050.pdf)
>  Generic Event Boundary Captioning (GEBC) aims to generate three sentences describing the status change for a given time boundary. Previous methods only process the information of a single boundary at a time, which lacks utilization of video context information. To tackle this issue, we design a model that directly takes the whole video as input and generates captions for all boundaries parallelly. The model could learn the context information for each time boundary by modeling the boundary-boundary interactions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of context information. The proposed method achieved a 72.84 score on the test set, and we reached the $2^{nd}$ place in this challenge.

### 74.Memory-Based Label-Text Tuning for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01036.pdf)
>  Few-shot class-incremental learning(FSCIL) focuses on designing learning algorithms that can continually learn a sequence of new tasks from a few samples without forgetting old ones. The difficulties are that training on a sequence of limited data from new tasks leads to severe overfitting issues and causes the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem. Existing researches mainly utilize the image information, such as storing the image knowledge of previous tasks or limiting classifiers updating. However, they ignore analyzing the informative and less noisy text information of class labels. In this work, we propose leveraging the label-text information by adopting the memory prompt. The memory prompt can learn new data sequentially, and meanwhile store the previous knowledge. Furthermore, to optimize the memory prompt without undermining the stored knowledge, we propose a stimulation-based training strategy. It optimizes the memory prompt depending on the image embedding stimulation, which is the distribution of the image embedding elements. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms all prior state-of-the-art approaches, significantly mitigating the catastrophic forgetting and overfitting problems.      
### 75.Boosting Single-Frame 3D Object Detection by Simulating Multi-Frame Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01030.pdf)
>  To boost a detector for single-frame 3D object detection, we present a new approach to train it to simulate features and responses following a detector trained on multi-frame point clouds. Our approach needs multi-frame point clouds only when training the single-frame detector, and once trained, it can detect objects with only single-frame point clouds as inputs during the inference. We design a novel Simulated Multi-Frame Single-Stage object Detector (SMF-SSD) framework to realize the approach: multi-view dense object fusion to densify ground-truth objects to generate a multi-frame point cloud; self-attention voxel distillation to facilitate one-to-many knowledge transfer from multi- to single-frame voxels; multi-scale BEV feature distillation to transfer knowledge in low-level spatial and high-level semantic BEV features; and adaptive response distillation to activate single-frame responses of high confidence and accurate localization. Experimental results on the Waymo test set show that our SMF-SSD consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art single-frame 3D object detectors for all object classes of difficulty levels 1 and 2 in terms of both mAP and mAPH.      
### 76.Lasers to Events: Automatic Extrinsic Calibration of Lidars and Event Cameras  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01009.pdf)
>  Despite significant academic and corporate efforts, autonomous driving under adverse visual conditions still proves challenging. As neuromorphic technology has matured, its application to robotics and autonomous vehicle systems has become an area of active research. Low-light and latency-demanding situations can benefit. To enable event cameras to operate alongside staple sensors like lidar in perception tasks, we propose a direct, temporally-decoupled calibration method between event cameras and lidars. The high dynamic range and low-light operation of event cameras are exploited to directly register lidar laser returns, allowing information-based correlation methods to optimize for the 6-DoF extrinsic calibration between the two sensors. This paper presents the first direct calibration method between event cameras and lidars, removing dependencies on frame-based camera intermediaries and/or highly-accurate hand measurements. Code will be made publicly available.      
### 77.Supervised learning for improving the accuracy of robot-mounted 3D camera applied to human gait analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01002.pdf)
>  The use of 3D cameras for gait analysis has been highly questioned due to the low accuracy they have demonstrated in the past. The objective of the study presented in this paper is to improve the accuracy of the estimations made by robot-mounted 3D cameras in human gait analysis by applying a supervised learning stage. The 3D camera was mounted in a mobile robot to obtain a longer walking distance. This study shows an improvement in detection of kinematic gait signals and gait descriptors by post-processing the raw estimations of the camera using artificial neural networks trained with the data obtained from a certified Vicon system. To achieve this, 37 healthy participants were recruited and data of 207 gait sequences were collected using an Orbbec Astra 3D camera. There are two basic possible approaches for training: using kinematic gait signals and using gait descriptors. The former seeks to improve the waveforms of kinematic gait signals by reducing the error and increasing the correlation with respect to the Vicon system. The second is a more direct approach, focusing on training the artificial neural networks using gait descriptors directly. The accuracy of the 3D camera was measured before and after training. In both training approaches, an improvement was observed. Kinematic gait signals showed lower errors and higher correlations with respect to the ground truth. The accuracy of the system to detect gait descriptors also showed a substantial improvement, mostly for kinematic descriptors rather than spatio-temporal. When comparing both training approaches, it was not possible to define which was the absolute best. Therefore, we believe that the selection of the training approach will depend on the purpose of the study to be conducted. This study reveals the great potential of 3D cameras and encourages the research community to continue exploring their use in gait analysis.      
### 78.Dynamic boxes fusion strategy in object detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00997.pdf)
>  Object detection on microscopic scenarios is a popular task. As microscopes always have variable magnifications, the object can vary substantially in scale, which burdens the optimization of detectors. Moreover, different situations of camera focusing bring in the blurry images, which leads to great challenge of distinguishing the boundaries between objects and background. To solve the two issues mentioned above, we provide bags of useful training strategies and extensive experiments on Chula-ParasiteEgg-11 dataset, bring non-negligible results on ICIP 2022 Challenge: Parasitic Egg Detection and Classification in Microscopic Images, further more, we propose a new box selection strategy and an improved boxes fusion method for multi-model ensemble, as a result our method wins 1st place(mIoU 95.28%, mF1Score 99.62%), which is also the state-of-the-art method on Chula-ParasiteEgg-11 dataset.      
### 79.NARRATE: A Normal Assisted Free-View Portrait Stylizer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00974.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose NARRATE, a novel pipeline that enables simultaneously editing portrait lighting and perspective in a photorealistic manner. As a hybrid neural-physical face model, NARRATE leverages complementary benefits of geometry-aware generative approaches and normal-assisted physical face models. In a nutshell, NARRATE first inverts the input portrait to a coarse geometry and employs neural rendering to generate images resembling the input, as well as producing convincing pose changes. However, inversion step introduces mismatch, bringing low-quality images with less facial details. As such, we further estimate portrait normal to enhance the coarse geometry, creating a high-fidelity physical face model. In particular, we fuse the neural and physical renderings to compensate for the imperfect inversion, resulting in both realistic and view-consistent novel perspective images. In relighting stage, previous works focus on single view portrait relighting but ignoring consistency between different perspectives as well, leading unstable and inconsistent lighting effects for view changes. We extend Total Relighting to fix this problem by unifying its multi-view input normal maps with the physical face model. NARRATE conducts relighting with consistent normal maps, imposing cross-view constraints and exhibiting stable and coherent illumination effects. We experimentally demonstrate that NARRATE achieves more photorealistic, reliable results over prior works. We further bridge NARRATE with animation and style transfer tools, supporting pose change, light change, facial animation, and style transfer, either separately or in combination, all at a photographic quality. We showcase vivid free-view facial animations as well as 3D-aware relightable stylization, which help facilitate various AR/VR applications like virtual cinematography, 3D video conferencing, and post-production.      
### 80.Trichomonas Vaginalis Segmentation in Microscope Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00973.pdf)
>  Trichomoniasis is a common infectious disease with high incidence caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, increasing the risk of getting HIV in humans if left untreated. Automated detection of Trichomonas vaginalis from microscopic images can provide vital information for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis. However, accurate Trichomonas vaginalis segmentation (TVS) is a challenging task due to the high appearance similarity between the Trichomonas and other cells (e.g., leukocyte), the large appearance variation caused by their motility, and, most importantly, the lack of large-scale annotated data for deep model training. To address these challenges, we elaborately collected the first large-scale Microscopic Image dataset of Trichomonas Vaginalis, named TVMI3K, which consists of 3,158 images covering Trichomonas of various appearances in diverse backgrounds, with high-quality annotations including object-level mask labels, object boundaries, and challenging attributes. Besides, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, termed TVNet, to automatically segment Trichomonas from microscopic images, including high-resolution fusion and foreground-background attention modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior segmentation performance and outperforms various cutting-edge object detection models both quantitatively and qualitatively, making it a promising framework to promote future research in TVS tasks. The dataset and results will be publicly available at: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/CellRecog/cellRecog" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 81.Cycle-Interactive Generative Adversarial Network for Robust Unsupervised Low-Light Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00965.pdf)
>  Getting rid of the fundamental limitations in fitting to the paired training data, recent unsupervised low-light enhancement methods excel in adjusting illumination and contrast of images. However, for unsupervised low light enhancement, the remaining noise suppression issue due to the lacking of supervision of detailed signal largely impedes the wide deployment of these methods in real-world applications. Herein, we propose a novel Cycle-Interactive Generative Adversarial Network (CIGAN) for unsupervised low-light image enhancement, which is capable of not only better transferring illumination distributions between low/normal-light images but also manipulating detailed signals between two domains, e.g., suppressing/synthesizing realistic noise in the cyclic enhancement/degradation process. In particular, the proposed low-light guided transformation feed-forwards the features of low-light images from the generator of enhancement GAN (eGAN) into the generator of degradation GAN (dGAN). With the learned information of real low-light images, dGAN can synthesize more realistic diverse illumination and contrast in low-light images. Moreover, the feature randomized perturbation module in dGAN learns to increase the feature randomness to produce diverse feature distributions, persuading the synthesized low-light images to contain realistic noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the superiority of the proposed method and the effectiveness of each module in CIGAN.      
### 82.WaferSegClassNet -- A Light-weight Network for Classification and Segmentation of Semiconductor Wafer Defects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00960.pdf)
>  As the integration density and design intricacy of semiconductor wafers increase, the magnitude and complexity of defects in them are also on the rise. Since the manual inspection of wafer defects is costly, an automated artificial intelligence (AI) based computer-vision approach is highly desired. The previous works on defect analysis have several limitations, such as low accuracy and the need for separate models for classification and segmentation. For analyzing mixed-type defects, some previous works require separately training one model for each defect type, which is non-scalable. In this paper, we present WaferSegClassNet (WSCN), a novel network based on encoder-decoder architecture. WSCN performs simultaneous classification and segmentation of both single and mixed-type wafer defects. WSCN uses a "shared encoder" for classification, and segmentation, which allows training WSCN end-to-end. We use N-pair contrastive loss to first pretrain the encoder and then use BCE-Dice loss for segmentation, and categorical cross-entropy loss for classification. Use of N-pair contrastive loss helps in better embedding representation in the latent dimension of wafer maps. WSCN has a model size of only 0.51MB and performs only 0.2M FLOPS. Thus, it is much lighter than other state-of-the-art models. Also, it requires only 150 epochs for convergence, compared to 4,000 epochs needed by a previous work. We evaluate our model on the MixedWM38 dataset, which has 38,015 images. WSCN achieves an average classification accuracy of 98.2% and a dice coefficient of 0.9999. We are the first to show segmentation results on the MixedWM38 dataset.

### 83.Degradation-Guided Meta-Restoration Network for Blind Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00943.pdf)
>  Blind super-resolution (SR) aims to recover high-quality visual textures from a low-resolution (LR) image, which is usually degraded by down-sampling blur kernels and additive noises. This task is extremely difficult due to the challenges of complicated image degradations in the real-world. Existing SR approaches either assume a predefined blur kernel or a fixed noise, which limits these approaches in challenging cases. In this paper, we propose a Degradation-guided Meta-restoration network for blind Super-Resolution (DMSR) that facilitates image restoration for real cases. DMSR consists of a degradation extractor and meta-restoration modules. The extractor estimates the degradations in LR inputs and guides the meta-restoration modules to predict restoration parameters for different degradations on-the-fly. DMSR is jointly optimized by a novel degradation consistency loss and reconstruction losses. Through such an optimization, DMSR outperforms SOTA by a large margin on three widely-used benchmarks. A user study including 16 subjects further validates the superiority of DMSR in real-world blind SR tasks.      
### 84.Interpretable by Design: Learning Predictors by Composing Interpretable Queries  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00938.pdf)
>  There is a growing concern about typically opaque decision-making with high-performance machine learning algorithms. Providing an explanation of the reasoning process in domain-specific terms can be crucial for adoption in risk-sensitive domains such as healthcare. We argue that machine learning algorithms should be interpretable by design and that the language in which these interpretations are expressed should be domain- and task-dependent. Consequently, we base our model's prediction on a family of user-defined and task-specific binary functions of the data, each having a clear interpretation to the end-user. We then minimize the expected number of queries needed for accurate prediction on any given input. As the solution is generally intractable, following prior work, we choose the queries sequentially based on information gain. However, in contrast to previous work, we need not assume the queries are conditionally independent. Instead, we leverage a stochastic generative model (VAE) and an MCMC algorithm (Unadjusted Langevin) to select the most informative query about the input based on previous query-answers. This enables the online determination of a query chain of whatever depth is required to resolve prediction ambiguities. Finally, experiments on vision and NLP tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and its superiority over post-hoc explanations.      
### 85.Continuous Sign Language Recognition via Temporal Super-Resolution Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00928.pdf)
>  Aiming at the problem that the spatial-temporal hierarchical continuous sign language recognition model based on deep learning has a large amount of computation, which limits the real-time application of the model, this paper proposes a temporal super-resolution network(TSRNet). The data is reconstructed into a dense feature sequence to reduce the overall model computation while keeping the final recognition accuracy loss to a minimum. The continuous sign language recognition model(CSLR) via TSRNet mainly consists of three parts: frame-level feature extraction, time series feature extraction and TSRNet, where TSRNet is located between frame-level feature extraction and time-series feature extraction, which mainly includes two branches: detail descriptor and rough descriptor. The sparse frame-level features are fused through the features obtained by the two designed branches as the reconstructed dense frame-level feature sequence, and the connectionist temporal classification(CTC) loss is used for training and optimization after the time-series feature extraction part. To better recover semantic-level information, the overall model is trained with the self-generating adversarial training method proposed in this paper to reduce the model error rate. The training method regards the TSRNet as the generator, and the frame-level processing part and the temporal processing part as the discriminator. In addition, in order to unify the evaluation criteria of model accuracy loss under different benchmarks, this paper proposes word error rate deviation(WERD), which takes the error rate between the estimated word error rate (WER) and the reference WER obtained by the reconstructed frame-level feature sequence and the complete original frame-level feature sequence as the WERD. Experiments on two large-scale sign language datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.      
### 86.SKIPP'D: a SKy Images and Photovoltaic Power Generation Dataset for Short-term Solar Forecasting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00913.pdf)
>  Large-scale integration of photovoltaics (PV) into electricity grids is challenged by the intermittent nature of solar power. Sky-image-based solar forecasting using deep learning has been recognized as a promising approach to predicting the short-term fluctuations. However, there are few publicly available standardized benchmark datasets for image-based solar forecasting, which limits the comparison of different forecasting models and the exploration of forecasting methods. To fill these gaps, we introduce SKIPP'D -- a SKy Images and Photovoltaic Power Generation Dataset. The dataset contains three years (2017-2019) of quality-controlled down-sampled sky images and PV power generation data that is ready-to-use for short-term solar forecasting using deep learning. In addition, to support the flexibility in research, we provide the high resolution, high frequency sky images and PV power generation data as well as the concurrent sky video footage. We also include a code base containing data processing scripts and baseline model implementations for researchers to reproduce our previous work and accelerate their research in solar forecasting.      
### 87.Drift Reduction for Monocular Visual Odometry of Intelligent Vehicles using Feedforward Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00909.pdf)
>  In this paper, an approach for reducing the drift in monocular visual odometry algorithms is proposed based on a feedforward neural network. A visual odometry algorithm computes the incremental motion of the vehicle between the successive camera frames, then integrates these increments to determine the pose of the vehicle. The proposed neural network reduces the errors in the pose estimation of the vehicle which results from the inaccuracies in features detection and matching, camera intrinsic parameters, and so on. These inaccuracies are propagated to the motion estimation of the vehicle causing larger amounts of estimation errors. The drift reducing neural network identifies such errors based on the motion of features in the successive camera frames leading to more accurate incremental motion estimates. The proposed drift reducing neural network is trained and validated using the KITTI dataset and the results show the efficacy of the proposed approach in reducing the errors in the incremental orientation estimation, thus reducing the overall error in the pose estimation.      
### 88.Face Morphing Attack Detection Using Privacy-Aware Training Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00899.pdf)
>  Images of morphed faces pose a serious threat to face recognition--based security systems, as they can be used to illegally verify the identity of multiple people with a single morphed image. Modern detection algorithms learn to identify such morphing attacks using authentic images of real individuals. This approach raises various privacy concerns and limits the amount of publicly available training data. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of detection algorithms that are trained only on faces of non--existing people and their respective morphs. To this end, two dedicated algorithms are trained with synthetic data and then evaluated on three real-world datasets, i.e.: FRLL-Morphs, FERET-Morphs and FRGC-Morphs. Our results show that synthetic facial images can be successfully employed for the training process of the detection algorithms and generalize well to real-world scenarios.      
### 89.Towards Robust Video Object Segmentation with Adaptive Object Calibration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00887.pdf)
>  In the booming video era, video segmentation attracts increasing research attention in the multimedia community. Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims at segmenting objects in all target frames of a video, given annotated object masks of reference frames. Most existing methods build pixel-wise reference-target correlations and then perform pixel-wise tracking to obtain target masks. Due to neglecting object-level cues, pixel-level approaches make the tracking vulnerable to perturbations, and even indiscriminate among similar objects. Towards robust VOS, the key insight is to calibrate the representation and mask of each specific object to be expressive and discriminative. Accordingly, we propose a new deep network, which can adaptively construct object representations and calibrate object masks to achieve stronger robustness. First, we construct the object representations by applying an adaptive object proxy (AOP) aggregation method, where the proxies represent arbitrary-shaped segments at multi-levels for reference. Then, prototype masks are initially generated from the reference-target correlations based on AOP. Afterwards, such proto-masks are further calibrated through network modulation, conditioning on the object proxy representations. We consolidate this conditional mask calibration process in a progressive manner, where the object representations and proto-masks evolve to be discriminative iteratively. Extensive experiments are conducted on the standard VOS benchmarks, YouTube-VOS-18/19 and DAVIS-17. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance among existing published works, and also exhibits superior robustness against perturbations.

### 90.ORA3D: Overlap Region Aware Multi-view 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00865.pdf)
>  In multi-view 3D object detection tasks, disparity supervision over overlapping image regions substantially improves the overall detection performance. However, current multi-view 3D object detection methods often fail to detect objects in the overlap region properly, and the network's understanding of the scene is often limited to that of a monocular detection network. To mitigate this issue, we advocate for applying the traditional stereo disparity estimation method to obtain reliable disparity information for the overlap region. Given the disparity estimates as a supervision, we propose to regularize the network to fully utilize the geometric potential of binocular images, and improve the overall detection accuracy. Moreover, we propose to use an adversarial overlap region discriminator, which is trained to minimize the representational gap between non-overlap regions and overlapping regions where objects are often largely occluded or suffer from deformation due to camera distortion, causing a domain shift. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with the large-scale multi-view 3D object detection benchmark, called nuScenes. Our experiment shows that our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.      
### 91.Hardware architecture for high throughput event visual data filtering with matrix of IIR filters algorithm  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00860.pdf)
>  Neuromorphic vision is a rapidly growing field with numerous applications in the perception systems of autonomous vehicles. Unfortunately, due to the sensors working principle, there is a significant amount of noise in the event stream. In this paper we present a novel algorithm based on an IIR filter matrix for filtering this type of noise and a hardware architecture that allows its acceleration using an SoC FPGA. Our method has a very good filtering efficiency for uncorrelated noise - over 99% of noisy events are removed. It has been tested for several event data sets with added random noise. We designed the hardware architecture in such a way as to reduce the utilisation of the FPGA's internal BRAM resources. This enabled a very low latency and a throughput of up to 385.8 MEPS million events per second.The proposed hardware architecture was verified in simulation and in hardware on the Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC chip on the Mercury+ XU9 module with the Mercury+ ST1 base board.      
### 92.Less Is More: A Comparison of Active Learning Strategies for 3D Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00845.pdf)
>  Since labeling medical image data is a costly and labor-intensive process, active learning has gained much popularity in the medical image segmentation domain in recent years. A variety of active learning strategies have been proposed in the literature, but their effectiveness is highly dependent on the dataset and training scenario. To facilitate the comparison of existing strategies and provide a baseline for evaluating novel strategies, we evaluate the performance of several well-known active learning strategies on three datasets from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Additionally, we consider a strided sampling strategy specifically tailored to 3D image data. We demonstrate that both random and strided sampling act as strong baselines and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the studied methods. To allow other researchers to compare their work to our results, we provide an open-source framework for benchmarking active learning strategies on a variety of medical segmentation datasets.      
### 93.UTD-Yolov5: A Real-time Underwater Targets Detection Method based on Attention Improved YOLOv5  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00837.pdf)
>  As the treasure house of nature, the ocean contains abundant resources. But the coral reefs, which are crucial to the sustainable development of marine life, are facing a huge crisis because of the existence of COTS and other organisms. The protection of society through manual labor is limited and inefficient. The unpredictable nature of the marine environment also makes manual operations risky. The use of robots for underwater operations has become a trend. However, the underwater image acquisition has defects such as weak light, low resolution, and many interferences, while the existing target detection algorithms are not effective. Based on this, we propose an underwater target detection algorithm based on Attention Improved YOLOv5, called UTD-Yolov5. It can quickly and efficiently detect COTS, which in turn provides a prerequisite for complex underwater operations. We adjusted the original network architecture of YOLOv5 in multiple stages, including: replacing the original Backbone with a two-stage cascaded CSP (CSP2); introducing the visual channel attention mechanism module SE; designing random anchor box similarity calculation method etc. These operations enable UTD-Yolov5 to detect more flexibly and capture features more accurately. In order to make the network more efficient, we also propose optimization methods such as WBF and iterative refinement mechanism. This paper conducts a lot of experiments based on the CSIRO dataset [1]. The results show that the average accuracy of our UTD-Yolov5 reaches 78.54%, which is a great improvement compared to the baseline.      
### 94.ImLoveNet: Misaligned Image-supported Registration Network for Low-overlap Point Cloud Pairs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00826.pdf)
>  Low-overlap regions between paired point clouds make the captured features very low-confidence, leading cutting edge models to point cloud registration with poor quality. Beyond the traditional wisdom, we raise an intriguing question: Is it possible to exploit an intermediate yet misaligned image between two low-overlap point clouds to enhance the performance of cutting-edge registration models? To answer it, we propose a misaligned image supported registration network for low-overlap point cloud pairs, dubbed ImLoveNet. ImLoveNet first learns triple deep features across different modalities and then exports these features to a two-stage classifier, for progressively obtaining the high-confidence overlap region between the two point clouds. Therefore, soft correspondences are well established on the predicted overlap region, resulting in accurate rigid transformations for registration. ImLoveNet is simple to implement yet effective, since 1) the misaligned image provides clearer overlap information for the two low-overlap point clouds to better locate overlap parts; 2) it contains certain geometry knowledge to extract better deep features; and 3) it does not require the extrinsic parameters of the imaging device with respect to the reference frame of the 3D point cloud. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on different kinds of benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our ImLoveNet over state-of-the-art approaches.      
### 95.Less is More: Adaptive Curriculum Learning for Thyroid Nodule Diagnosis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00807.pdf)
>  Thyroid nodule classification aims at determining whether the nodule is benign or malignant based on a given ultrasound image. However, the label obtained by the cytological biopsy which is the golden standard in clinical medicine is not always consistent with the ultrasound imaging TI-RADS criteria. The information difference between the two causes the existing deep learning-based classification methods to be indecisive. To solve the Inconsistent Label problem, we propose an Adaptive Curriculum Learning (ACL) framework, which adaptively discovers and discards the samples with inconsistent labels. Specifically, ACL takes both hard sample and model certainty into account, and could accurately determine the threshold to distinguish the samples with Inconsistent Label. Moreover, we contribute TNCD: a Thyroid Nodule Classification Dataset to facilitate future related research on the thyroid nodules. Extensive experimental results on TNCD based on three different backbone networks not only demonstrate the superiority of our method but also prove that the less-is-more principle which strategically discards the samples with Inconsistent Label could yield performance gains.

### 96.Benchmarks for Industrial Inspection Based on Structured Light  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00796.pdf)
>  Robustness and accuracy are two critical metrics for industrial inspection. In this paper, we propose benchmarks that can evaluate the structured light method's performance. Our evaluation metric was learning from a lot of inspection tasks from the factories. The metric we proposed consists of four detailed criteria such as flatness, length, height and sphericity. Then we can judge whether the structured light method/device can be applied to a specified inspection task by our evaluation metric quickly. A structured light device built for TypeC pin needles inspection performance is evaluated via our metrics in the final experimental section.      
### 97.Boundary-Guided Camouflaged Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00794.pdf)
>  Camouflaged object detection (COD), segmenting objects that are elegantly blended into their surroundings, is a valuable yet challenging task. Existing deep-learning methods often fall into the difficulty of accurately identifying the camouflaged object with complete and fine object structure. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel boundary-guided network (BGNet) for camouflaged object detection. Our method explores valuable and extra object-related edge semantics to guide representation learning of COD, which forces the model to generate features that highlight object structure, thereby promoting camouflaged object detection of accurate boundary localization. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our BGNet significantly outperforms the existing 18 state-of-the-art methods under four widely-used evaluation metrics.

### 98.Learning Cross-Image Object Semantic Relation in Transformer for Few-Shot Fine-Grained Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00784.pdf)
>  Few-shot fine-grained learning aims to classify a query image into one of a set of support categories with fine-grained differences. Although learning different objects' local differences via Deep Neural Networks has achieved success, how to exploit the query-support cross-image object semantic relations in Transformer-based architecture remains under-explored in the few-shot fine-grained scenario. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based double-helix model, namely HelixFormer, to achieve the cross-image object semantic relation mining in a bidirectional and symmetrical manner. The HelixFormer consists of two steps: 1) Relation Mining Process (RMP) across different branches, and 2) Representation Enhancement Process (REP) within each individual branch. By the designed RMP, each branch can extract fine-grained object-level Cross-image Semantic Relation Maps (CSRMs) using information from the other branch, ensuring better cross-image interaction in semantically related local object regions. Further, with the aid of CSRMs, the developed REP can strengthen the extracted features for those discovered semantically-related local regions in each branch, boosting the model's ability to distinguish subtle feature differences of fine-grained objects. Extensive experiments conducted on five public fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate that HelixFormer can effectively enhance the cross-image object semantic relation matching for recognizing fine-grained objects, achieving much better performance over most state-of-the-art methods under 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.

### 99.Backdoor Attack is A Devil in Federated GAN-based Medical Image Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00762.pdf)
>  Deep Learning-based image synthesis techniques have been applied in healthcare research for generating medical images to support open research. Training generative adversarial neural networks (GAN) usually requires large amounts of training data. Federated learning (FL) provides a way of training a central model using distributed data from different medical institutions while keeping raw data locally. However, FL is vulnerable to backdoor attack, an adversarial by poisoning training data, given the central server cannot access the original data directly. Most backdoor attack strategies focus on classification models and centralized domains. In this study, we propose a way of attacking federated GAN (FedGAN) by treating the discriminator with a commonly used data poisoning strategy in backdoor attack classification models. We demonstrate that adding a small trigger with size less than 0.5 percent of the original image size can corrupt the FL-GAN model. Based on the proposed attack, we provide two effective defense strategies: global malicious detection and local training regularization. We show that combining the two defense strategies yields a robust medical image generation.      
### 100.PhotoScene: Photorealistic Material and Lighting Transfer for Indoor Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00757.pdf)
>  Most indoor 3D scene reconstruction methods focus on recovering 3D geometry and scene layout. In this work, we go beyond this to propose PhotoScene, a framework that takes input image(s) of a scene along with approximately aligned CAD geometry (either reconstructed automatically or manually specified) and builds a photorealistic digital twin with high-quality materials and similar lighting. We model scene materials using procedural material graphs; such graphs represent photorealistic and resolution-independent materials. We optimize the parameters of these graphs and their texture scale and rotation, as well as the scene lighting to best match the input image via a differentiable rendering layer. We evaluate our technique on objects and layout reconstructions from ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and stock photographs, and demonstrate that our method reconstructs high-quality, fully relightable 3D scenes that can be re-rendered under arbitrary viewpoints, zooms and lighting.      
### 101.Gaussian Kernel-based Cross Modal Network for Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00744.pdf)
>  Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) is a challenging task which aims to localize the spatio-temporal tube of the interested object semantically according to a natural language query. Most previous works not only severely rely on the anchor boxes extracted by Faster R-CNN, but also simply regard the video as a series of individual frames, thus lacking their temporal modeling. Instead, in this paper, we are the first to propose an anchor-free framework for STVG, called Gaussian Kernel-based Cross Modal Network (GKCMN). Specifically, we utilize the learned Gaussian Kernel-based heatmaps of each video frame to locate the query-related object. A mixed serial and parallel connection network is further developed to leverage both spatial and temporal relations among frames for better grounding. Experimental results on VidSTG dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GKCMN.      
### 102.Golfer: Trajectory Prediction with Masked Goal Conditioning MnM Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00738.pdf)
>  Transformers have enabled breakthroughs in NLP and computer vision, and have recently began to show promising performance in trajectory prediction for Autonomous Vehicle (AV). How to efficiently model the interactive relationships between the ego agent and other road and dynamic objects remains challenging for the standard attention module. In this work we propose a general Transformer-like architectural module MnM network equipped with novel masked goal conditioning training procedures for AV trajectory prediction. The resulted model, named golfer, achieves state-of-the-art performance, winning the 2nd place in the 2022 Waymo Open Dataset Motion Prediction Challenge and ranked 1st place according to minADE.      
### 103.Contrastive Cross-Modal Knowledge Sharing Pre-training for Vision-Language Representation Learning and Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00733.pdf)
>  Recently, the cross-modal pre-training task has been a hotspot because of its wide application in various down-streaming researches including retrieval, captioning, question answering and so on. However, exiting methods adopt a one-stream pre-training model to explore the united vision-language representation for conducting cross-modal retrieval, which easily suffer from the calculation explosion. Moreover, although the conventional double-stream structures are quite efficient, they still lack the vital cross-modal interactions, resulting in low performances. Motivated by these challenges, we put forward a Contrastive Cross-Modal Knowledge Sharing Pre-training (COOKIE) to grasp the joint text-image representations. Structurally, COOKIE adopts the traditional double-stream structure because of the acceptable time consumption. To overcome the inherent defects of double-stream structure as mentioned above, we elaborately design two effective modules. Concretely, the first module is a weight-sharing transformer that builds on the head of the visual and textual encoders, aiming to semantically align text and image. This design enables visual and textual paths focus on the same semantics. The other one is three specially designed contrastive learning, aiming to share knowledge between different models. The shared cross-modal knowledge develops the study of unimodal representation greatly, promoting the single-modal retrieval tasks. Extensive experimental results on multi-modal matching researches that includes cross-modal retrieval, text matching, and image retrieval reveal the superiors in calculation efficiency and statistical indicators of our pre-training model.      
### 104.SketchCleanNet -- A deep learning approach to the enhancement and correction of query sketches for a 3D CAD model retrieval system  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00732.pdf)
>  Search and retrieval remains a major research topic in several domains, including computer graphics, computer vision, engineering design, etc. A search engine requires primarily an input search query and a database of items to search from. In engineering, which is the primary context of this paper, the database consists of 3D CAD models, such as washers, pistons, connecting rods, etc. A query from a user is typically in the form of a sketch, which attempts to capture the details of a 3D model. However, sketches have certain typical defects such as gaps, over-drawn portions (multi-strokes), etc. Since the retrieved results are only as good as the input query, sketches need cleaning-up and enhancement for better retrieval results. <br>In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to improve or clean the query sketches. Initially, sketches from various categories are analysed in order to understand the many possible defects that may occur. A dataset of cleaned-up or enhanced query sketches is then created based on an understanding of these defects. Consequently, an end-to-end training of a deep neural network is carried out in order to provide a mapping between the defective and the clean sketches. This network takes the defective query sketch as the input and generates a clean or an enhanced query sketch. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art techniques show that the proposed approach is effective. The results of the search engine are reported using both the defective and enhanced query sketches, and it is shown that using the enhanced query sketches from the developed approach yields improved search results.      
### 105.Multi-scale Attentive Image De-raining Networks via Neural Architecture Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00728.pdf)
>  Multi-scale architectures and attention modules have shown effectiveness in many deep learning-based image de-raining methods. However, manually designing and integrating these two components into a neural network requires a bulk of labor and extensive expertise. In this article, a high-performance multi-scale attentive neural architecture search (MANAS) framework is technically developed for image deraining. The proposed method formulates a new multi-scale attention search space with multiple flexible modules that are favorite to the image de-raining task. Under the search space, multi-scale attentive cells are built, which are further used to construct a powerful image de-raining network. The internal multiscale attentive architecture of the de-raining network is searched automatically through a gradient-based search algorithm, which avoids the daunting procedure of the manual design to some extent. Moreover, in order to obtain a robust image de-raining model, a practical and effective multi-to-one training strategy is also presented to allow the de-raining network to get sufficient background information from multiple rainy images with the same background scene, and meanwhile, multiple loss functions including external loss, internal loss, architecture regularization loss, and model complexity loss are jointly optimized to achieve robust de-raining performance and controllable model complexity. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and realistic rainy images, as well as the down-stream vision applications (i.e., objection detection and segmentation) consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.      
### 106.Noise and Edge Based Dual Branch Image Manipulation Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00724.pdf)
>  Unlike ordinary computer vision tasks that focus more on the semantic content of images, the image manipulation detection task pays more attention to the subtle information of image manipulation. In this paper, the noise image extracted by the improved constrained convolution is used as the input of the model instead of the original image to obtain more subtle traces of manipulation. Meanwhile, the dual-branch network, consisting of a high-resolution branch and a context branch, is used to capture the traces of artifacts as much as possible. In general, most manipulation leaves manipulation artifacts on the manipulation edge. A specially designed manipulation edge detection module is constructed based on the dual-branch network to identify these artifacts better. The correlation between pixels in an image is closely related to their distance. The farther the two pixels are, the weaker the correlation. We add a distance factor to the self-attention module to better describe the correlation between pixels. Experimental results on four publicly available image manipulation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.      
### 107.Turning to a Teacher for Timestamp Supervised Temporal Action Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00712.pdf)
>  Temporal action segmentation in videos has drawn much attention recently. Timestamp supervision is a cost-effective way for this task. To obtain more information to optimize the model, the existing method generated pseudo frame-wise labels iteratively based on the output of a segmentation model and the timestamp annotations. However, this practice may introduce noise and oscillation during the training, and lead to performance degeneration. To address this problem, we propose a new framework for timestamp supervised temporal action segmentation by introducing a teacher model parallel to the segmentation model to help stabilize the process of model optimization. The teacher model can be seen as an ensemble of the segmentation model, which helps to suppress the noise and to improve the stability of pseudo labels. We further introduce a segmentally smoothing loss, which is more focused and cohesive, to enforce the smooth transition of the predicted probabilities within action instances. The experiments on three datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method and performs comparably against the fully-supervised methods at a much lower annotation cost.      
### 108.Few-shot incremental learning in the context of solar cell quality inspection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00693.pdf)
>  In industry, Deep Neural Networks have shown high defect detection rates surpassing other more traditional manual feature engineering based proposals. This has been achieved mainly through supervised training where a great amount of data is required in order to learn good classification models. However, such amount of data is sometimes hard to obtain in industrial scenarios, as few defective pieces are produced normally. In addition, certain kinds of defects are very rare and usually just appear from time to time, which makes the generation of a proper dataset for training a classification model even harder. Moreover, the lack of available data limits the adaptation of inspection models to new defect types that appear in production as it might require a model retraining in order to incorporate the detects and detect them. In this work, we have explored the technique of weight imprinting in the context of solar cell quality inspection where we have trained a network on three base defect classes, and then we have incorporated new defect classes using few samples. The results have shown that this technique allows the network to extend its knowledge with regard to defect classes with few samples, which can be interesting for industrial practitioners.      
### 109.DRESS: Dynamic REal-time Sparse Subnets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00670.pdf)
>  The limited and dynamically varied resources on edge devices motivate us to deploy an optimized deep neural network that can adapt its sub-networks to fit in different resource constraints. However, existing works often build sub-networks through searching different network architectures in a hand-crafted sampling space, which not only can result in a subpar performance but also may cause on-device re-configuration overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm, Dynamic REal-time Sparse Subnets (DRESS). DRESS samples multiple sub-networks from the same backbone network through row-based unstructured sparsity, and jointly trains these sub-networks in parallel with weighted loss. DRESS also exploits strategies including parameter reusing and row-based fine-grained sampling for efficient storage consumption and efficient on-device adaptation. Extensive experiments on public vision datasets show that DRESS yields significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art sub-networks.      
### 110.ViRel: Unsupervised Visual Relations Discovery with Graph-level Analogy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00590.pdf)
>  Visual relations form the basis of understanding our compositional world, as relationships between visual objects capture key information in a scene. It is then advantageous to learn relations automatically from the data, as learning with predefined labels cannot capture all possible relations. However, current relation learning methods typically require supervision, and are not designed to generalize to scenes with more complicated relational structures than those seen during training. Here, we introduce ViRel, a method for unsupervised discovery and learning of Visual Relations with graph-level analogy. In a setting where scenes within a task share the same underlying relational subgraph structure, our learning method of contrasting isomorphic and non-isomorphic graphs discovers the relations across tasks in an unsupervised manner. Once the relations are learned, ViRel can then retrieve the shared relational graph structure for each task by parsing the predicted relational structure. Using a dataset based on grid-world and the Abstract Reasoning Corpus, we show that our method achieves above 95% accuracy in relation classification, discovers the relation graph structure for most tasks, and further generalizes to unseen tasks with more complicated relational structures.      
### 111.SSD-Faster Net: A Hybrid Network for Industrial Defect Inspection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00589.pdf)
>  The quality of industrial components is critical to the production of special equipment such as robots. Defect inspection of these components is an efficient way to ensure quality. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network, SSD-Faster Net, for industrial defect inspection of rails, insulators, commutators etc. SSD-Faster Net is a two-stage network, including SSD for quickly locating defective blocks, and an improved Faster R-CNN for defect segmentation. For the former, we propose a novel slice localization mechanism to help SSD scan quickly. The second stage is based on improved Faster R-CNN, using FPN, deformable kernel(DK) to enhance representation ability. It fuses multi-scale information, and self-adapts the receptive field. We also propose a novel loss function and use ROI Align to improve accuracy. Experiments show that our SSD-Faster Net achieves an average accuracy of 84.03%, which is 13.42% higher than the nearest competitor based on Faster R-CNN, 4.14% better than GAN-based methods, more than 10% higher than that of DNN-based detectors. And the computing speed is improved by nearly 7%, which proves its robustness and superior performance.      
### 112.CoVA: Exploiting Compressed-Domain Analysis to Accelerate Video Analytics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00588.pdf)
>  Modern retrospective analytics systems leverage cascade architecture to mitigate bottleneck for computing deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the existing cascades suffer two limitations: (1) decoding bottleneck is either neglected or circumvented, paying significant compute and storage cost for pre-processing; and (2) the systems are specialized for temporal queries and lack spatial query support. This paper presents CoVA, a novel cascade architecture that splits the cascade computation between compressed domain and pixel domain to address the decoding bottleneck, supporting both temporal and spatial queries. CoVA cascades analysis into three major stages where the first two stages are performed in compressed domain while the last one in pixel domain. First, CoVA detects occurrences of moving objects (called blobs) over a set of compressed frames (called tracks). Then, using the track results, CoVA prudently selects a minimal set of frames to obtain the label information and only decode them to compute the full DNNs, alleviating the decoding bottleneck. Lastly, CoVA associates tracks with labels to produce the final analysis results on which users can process both temporal and spatial queries. Our experiments demonstrate that CoVA offers 4.8x throughput improvement over modern cascade systems, while imposing modest accuracy loss.      
### 113.Pair-Relationship Modeling for Latent Fingerprint Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00587.pdf)
>  Latent fingerprints are important for identifying criminal suspects. However, recognizing a latent fingerprint in a collection of reference fingerprints remains a challenge. Most, if not all, of existing methods would extract representation features of each fingerprint independently and then compare the similarity of these representation features for recognition in a different process. Without the supervision of similarity for the feature extraction process, the extracted representation features are hard to optimally reflect the similarity of the two compared fingerprints which is the base for matching decision making. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that can model the pair-relationship of two fingerprints directly as the similarity feature for recognition. The pair-relationship is modeled by a hybrid deep network which can handle the difficulties of random sizes and corrupted areas of latent fingerprints. Experimental results on two databases show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art.      
### 114.PrUE: Distilling Knowledge from Sparse Teacher Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00586.pdf)
>  Although deep neural networks have enjoyed remarkable success across a wide variety of tasks, their ever-increasing size also imposes significant overhead on deployment. To compress these models, knowledge distillation was proposed to transfer knowledge from a cumbersome (teacher) network into a lightweight (student) network. However, guidance from a teacher does not always improve the generalization of students, especially when the size gap between student and teacher is large. Previous works argued that it was due to the high certainty of the teacher, resulting in harder labels that were difficult to fit. To soften these labels, we present a pruning method termed Prediction Uncertainty Enlargement (PrUE) to simplify the teacher. Specifically, our method aims to decrease the teacher's certainty about data, thereby generating soft predictions for students. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method with experiments on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet. Results indicate that student networks trained with sparse teachers achieve better performance. Besides, our method allows researchers to distill knowledge from deeper networks to improve students further.

### 115.Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Transfer Learning and Weighted Loss  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01584.pdf)
>  Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that gradually deprives the patient of cognitive function and can end in death. With the advancement of technology today, it is possible to detect Alzheimer's disease through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. So that MRI is the technique most often used for the diagnosis and analysis of the progress of Alzheimer's disease. With this technology, image recognition in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be achieved automatically using machine learning. Although machine learning has many advantages, currently the use of deep learning is more widely applied because it has stronger learning capabilities and is more suitable for solving image recognition problems. However, there are still several challenges that must be faced to implement deep learning, such as the need for large datasets, requiring large computing resources, and requiring careful parameter setting to prevent overfitting or underfitting. In responding to the challenge of classifying Alzheimer's disease using deep learning, this study propose the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method with the Residual Network 18 Layer (ResNet-18) architecture. To overcome the need for a large and balanced dataset, transfer learning from ImageNet is used and weighting the loss function values so that each class has the same weight. And also in this study conducted an experiment by changing the network activation function to a mish activation function to increase accuracy. From the results of the tests that have been carried out, the accuracy of the model is 88.3 % using transfer learning, weighted loss and the mish activation function. This accuracy value increases from the baseline model which only gets an accuracy of 69.1 %.      
### 116.Spatiotemporal Feature Learning Based on Two-Step LSTM and Transformer for CT Scans  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01579.pdf)
>  Computed tomography (CT) imaging could be very practical for diagnosing various diseases. However, the nature of the CT images is even more diverse since the resolution and number of the slices of a CT scan are determined by the machine and its settings. Conventional deep learning models are hard to tickle such diverse data since the essential requirement of the deep neural network is the consistent shape of the input data. In this paper, we propose a novel, effective, two-step-wise approach to tickle this issue for COVID-19 symptom classification thoroughly. First, the semantic feature embedding of each slice for a CT scan is extracted by conventional backbone networks. Then, we proposed a long short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer-based sub-network to deal with temporal feature learning, leading to spatiotemporal feature representation learning. In this fashion, the proposed two-step LSTM model could prevent overfitting, as well as increase performance. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the proposed two-step method not only shows excellent performance but also could be compensated for each other. More specifically, the two-step LSTM model has a lower false-negative rate, while the 2-step Swin model has a lower false-positive rate. In summary, it is suggested that the model ensemble could be adopted for more stable and promising performance in real-world applications.      
### 117.Counterbalancing Teacher: Regularizing Batch Normalized Models for Robustness  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01548.pdf)
>  Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous technique for training deep neural networks that accelerates their convergence to reach higher accuracy. However, we demonstrate that BN comes with a fundamental drawback: it incentivizes the model to rely on low-variance features that are highly specific to the training (in-domain) data, hurting generalization performance on out-of-domain examples. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon by first showing that removing BN layers across a wide range of architectures leads to lower out-of-domain and corruption errors at the cost of higher in-domain errors. We then propose Counterbalancing Teacher (CT), a method which leverages a frozen copy of the same model without BN as a teacher to enforce the student network's learning of robust representations by substantially adapting its weights through a consistency loss function. This regularization signal helps CT perform well in unforeseen data shifts, even without information from the target domain as in prior works. We theoretically show in an overparameterized linear regression setting why normalization leads to a model's reliance on such in-domain features, and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of CT by outperforming several baselines on robustness benchmarks such as CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and VLCS.      
### 118.Adaptive GLCM sampling for transformer-based COVID-19 detection on CT  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01520.pdf)
>  The world has suffered from COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) for the last two years, causing much damage and change in people's daily lives. Thus, automated detection of COVID-19 utilizing deep learning on chest computed tomography (CT) scans became promising, which helps correct diagnosis efficiently. Recently, transformer-based COVID-19 detection method on CT is proposed to utilize 3D information in CT volume. However, its sampling method for selecting slices is not optimal. To leverage rich 3D information in CT volume, we propose a transformer-based COVID-19 detection using a novel data curation and adaptive sampling method using gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM). To train the model which consists of CNN layer, followed by transformer architecture, we first executed data curation based on lung segmentation and utilized the entropy of GLCM value of every slice in CT volumes to select important slices for the prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed method improve the detection performance with large margin without much difficult modification to the model.      
### 119.Representation Learning with Information Theory for COVID-19 Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01437.pdf)
>  Successful data representation is a fundamental factor in machine learning based medical imaging analysis. Deep Learning (DL) has taken an essential role in robust representation learning. However, the inability of deep models to generalize to unseen data can quickly overfit intricate patterns. Thereby, we can conveniently implement strategies to aid deep models in discovering useful priors from data to learn their intrinsic properties. Our model, which we call a dual role network (DRN), uses a dependency maximization approach based on Least Squared Mutual Information (LSMI). The LSMI leverages dependency measures to ensure representation invariance and local smoothness. While prior works have used information theory measures like mutual information, known to be computationally expensive due to a density estimation step, our LSMI formulation alleviates the issues of intractable mutual information estimation and can be used to approximate it. Experiments on CT based COVID-19 Detection and COVID-19 Severity Detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.      
### 120.Dynamic Contrastive Distillation for Image-Text Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01426.pdf)
>  Although the vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) equipped cross-modal image-text retrieval (ITR) has achieved remarkable progress in the past two years, it suffers from a major drawback: the ever-increasing size of VLP models restricts its deployment to real-world search scenarios (where the high latency is unacceptable). To alleviate this problem, we present a novel plug-in dynamic contrastive distillation (DCD) framework to compress the large VLP models for the ITR task. Technically, we face the following two challenges: 1) the typical uni-modal metric learning approach is difficult to directly apply to the cross-modal tasks, due to the limited GPU memory to optimize too many negative samples during handling cross-modal fusion features. 2) it is inefficient to static optimize the student network from different hard samples, which have different effects on distillation learning and student network optimization. We try to overcome these challenges from two points. First, to achieve multi-modal contrastive learning, and balance the training costs and effects, we propose to use a teacher network to estimate the difficult samples for students, making the students absorb the powerful knowledge from pre-trained teachers, and master the knowledge from hard samples. Second, to dynamic learn from hard sample pairs, we propose dynamic distillation to dynamically learn samples of different difficulties, from the perspective of better balancing the difficulty of knowledge and students' self-learning ability. We successfully apply our proposed DCD strategy to two state-of-the-art vision-language pretrained models, i.e. ViLT and METER. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our DCD framework. Encouragingly, we can speed up the inference at least 129$\times$ compared to the existing ITR models.      
### 121.VECtor: A Versatile Event-Centric Benchmark for Multi-Sensor SLAM  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01404.pdf)
>  Event cameras have recently gained in popularity as they hold strong potential to complement regular cameras in situations of high dynamics or challenging illumination. An important problem that may benefit from the addition of an event camera is given by Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). However, in order to ensure progress on event-inclusive multi-sensor SLAM, novel benchmark sequences are needed. Our contribution is the first complete set of benchmark datasets captured with a multi-sensor setup containing an event-based stereo camera, a regular stereo camera, multiple depth sensors, and an inertial measurement unit. The setup is fully hardware-synchronized and underwent accurate extrinsic calibration. All sequences come with ground truth data captured by highly accurate external reference devices such as a motion capture system. Individual sequences include both small and large-scale environments, and cover the specific challenges targeted by dynamic vision sensors.      
### 122.Hessian-Free Second-Order Adversarial Examples for Adversarial Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01396.pdf)
>  Recent studies show deep neural networks (DNNs) are extremely vulnerable to the elaborately designed adversarial examples. Adversarial learning with those adversarial examples has been proved as one of the most effective methods to defend against such an attack. At present, most existing adversarial examples generation methods are based on first-order gradients, which can hardly further improve models' robustness, especially when facing second-order adversarial attacks. Compared with first-order gradients, second-order gradients provide a more accurate approximation of the loss landscape with respect to natural examples. Inspired by this, our work crafts second-order adversarial examples and uses them to train DNNs. Nevertheless, second-order optimization involves time-consuming calculation for Hessian-inverse. We propose an approximation method through transforming the problem into an optimization in the Krylov subspace, which remarkably reduce the computational complexity to speed up the training procedure. Extensive experiments conducted on the MINIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that our adversarial learning with second-order adversarial examples outperforms other fisrt-order methods, which can improve the model robustness against a wide range of attacks.      
### 123.Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Spiking Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01382.pdf)
>  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently emerged as a new generation of low-power deep neural networks where binary spikes convey information across multiple timesteps. Pruning for SNNs is highly important as they become deployed on a resource-constraint mobile/edge device. The previous SNN pruning works focus on shallow SNNs (2~6 layers), however, deeper SNNs (&gt;16 layers) are proposed by state-of-the-art SNN works, which is difficult to be compatible with the current pruning work. To scale up a pruning technique toward deep SNNs, we investigate Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) which states that dense networks contain smaller subnetworks (i.e., winning tickets) that achieve comparable performance to the dense networks. Our studies on LTH reveal that the winning tickets consistently exist in deep SNNs across various datasets and architectures, providing up to 97% sparsity without huge performance degradation. However, the iterative searching process of LTH brings a huge training computational cost when combined with the multiple timesteps of SNNs. To alleviate such heavy searching cost, we propose Early-Time (ET) ticket where we find the important weight connectivity from a smaller number of timesteps. The proposed ET ticket can be seamlessly combined with common pruning techniques for finding winning tickets, such as Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) and Early-Bird (EB) tickets. Our experiment results show that the proposed ET ticket reduces search time by up to 38% compared to IMP or EB methods.      
### 124.Multi-scale alignment and Spatial ROI Module for COVID-19 Diagnosis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01345.pdf)
>  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and become a health crisis faced by humanity since first reported. Radiology imaging technologies such as computer tomography (CT) and chest X-ray imaging (CXR) are effective tools for diagnosing COVID-19. However, in CT and CXR images, the infected area occupies only a small part of the image. Some common deep learning methods that integrate large-scale receptive fields may cause the loss of image detail, resulting in the omission of the region of interest (ROI) in COVID-19 images and are therefore not suitable for further processing. To this end, we propose a deep spatial pyramid pooling (D-SPP) module to integrate contextual information over different resolutions, aiming to extract information under different scales of COVID-19 images effectively. Besides, we propose a COVID-19 infection detection (CID) module to draw attention to the lesion area and remove interference from irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on four CT and CXR datasets have shown that our method produces higher accuracy of detecting COVID-19 lesions in CT and CXR images. It can be used as a computer-aided diagnosis tool to help doctors effectively diagnose and screen for COVID-19.      
### 125.Assessing the Performance of Automated Prediction and Ranking of Patient Age from Chest X-rays Against Clinicians  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01302.pdf)
>  Understanding the internal physiological changes accompanying the aging process is an important aspect of medical image interpretation, with the expected changes acting as a baseline when reporting abnormal findings. Deep learning has recently been demonstrated to allow the accurate estimation of patient age from chest X-rays, and shows potential as a health indicator and mortality predictor. In this paper we present a novel comparative study of the relative performance of radiologists versus state-of-the-art deep learning models on two tasks: (a) patient age estimation from a single chest X-ray, and (b) ranking of two time-separated images of the same patient by age. We train our models with a heterogeneous database of 1.8M chest X-rays with ground truth patient ages and investigate the limitations on model accuracy imposed by limited training data and image resolution, and demonstrate generalisation performance on public data. To explore the large performance gap between the models and humans on these age-prediction tasks compared with other radiological reporting tasks seen in the literature, we incorporate our age prediction model into a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) allowing visualisation of the semantic features identified by the prediction model as significant to age prediction, comparing the identified features with those relied on by clinicians.      
### 126.FFCNet: Fourier Transform-Based Frequency Learning and Complex Convolutional Network for Colon Disease Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01287.pdf)
>  Reliable automatic classification of colonoscopy images is of great significance in assessing the stage of colonic lesions and formulating appropriate treatment plans. However, it is challenging due to uneven brightness, location variability, inter-class similarity, and intra-class dissimilarity, affecting the classification accuracy. To address the above issues, we propose a Fourier-based Frequency Complex Network (FFCNet) for colon disease classification in this study. Specifically, FFCNet is a novel complex network that enables the combination of complex convolutional networks with frequency learning to overcome the loss of phase information caused by real convolution operations. Also, our Fourier transform transfers the average brightness of an image to a point in the spectrum (the DC component), alleviating the effects of uneven brightness by decoupling image content and brightness. Moreover, the image patch scrambling module in FFCNet generates random local spectral blocks, empowering the network to learn long-range and local diseasespecific features and improving the discriminative ability of hard samples. We evaluated the proposed FFCNet on an in-house dataset with 2568 colonoscopy images, showing our method achieves high performance outperforming previous state-of-the art methods with an accuracy of 86:35% and an accuracy of 4.46% higher than the backbone.

### 127.CAM/CAD Point Cloud Part Segmentation via Few-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01218.pdf)
>  3D part segmentation is an essential step in advanced CAM/CAD workflow. Precise 3D segmentation contributes to lower defective rate of work-pieces produced by the manufacturing equipment (such as computer controlled CNCs), thereby improving work efficiency and attaining the attendant economic benefits. A large class of existing works on 3D model segmentation are mostly based on fully-supervised learning, which trains the AI models with large, annotated datasets. However, the disadvantage is that the resulting models from the fully-supervised learning methodology are highly reliant on the completeness of the available dataset, and its generalization ability is relatively poor to new unknown segmentation types (i.e. further additional novel classes). In this work, we propose and develop a noteworthy few-shot learning-based approach for effective part segmentation in CAM/CAD; and this is designed to significantly enhance its generalization ability and flexibly adapt to new segmentation tasks by using only relatively rather few samples. As a result, it not only reduces the requirements for the usually unattainable and exhaustive completeness of supervision datasets, but also improves the flexibility for real-world applications. As further improvement and innovation, we additionally adopt the transform net and the center loss block in the network. These characteristics serve to improve the comprehension for 3D features of the various possible instances of the whole work-piece and ensure the close distribution of the same class in feature space. Moreover, our approach stores data in the point cloud format that reduces space consumption, and which also makes the various procedures involved have significantly easier read and edit access (thus improving efficiency and effectiveness and lowering costs).      
### 128.Multi-Modal Multi-Correlation Learning for Audio-Visual Speech Separation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01197.pdf)
>  In this paper we propose a multi-modal multi-correlation learning framework targeting at the task of audio-visual speech separation. Although previous efforts have been extensively put on combining audio and visual modalities, most of them solely adopt a straightforward concatenation of audio and visual features. To exploit the real useful information behind these two modalities, we define two key correlations which are: (1) identity correlation (between timbre and facial attributes); (2) phonetic correlation (between phoneme and lip motion). These two correlations together comprise the complete information, which shows a certain superiority in separating target speaker's voice especially in some hard cases, such as the same gender or similar content. For implementation, contrastive learning or adversarial training approach is applied to maximize these two correlations. Both of them work well, while adversarial training shows its advantage by avoiding some limitations of contrastive learning. Compared with previous research, our solution demonstrates clear improvement on experimental metrics without additional complexity. Further analysis reveals the validity of the proposed architecture and its good potential for future extension.      
### 129.VIP-SLAM: An Efficient Tightly-Coupled RGB-D Visual Inertial Planar SLAM  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01158.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a tightly-coupled SLAM system fused with RGB, Depth, IMU and structured plane information. Traditional sparse points based SLAM systems always maintain a mass of map points to model the environment. Huge number of map points bring us a high computational complexity, making it difficult to be deployed on mobile devices. On the other hand, planes are common structures in man-made environment especially in indoor environments. We usually can use a small number of planes to represent a large scene. So the main purpose of this article is to decrease the high complexity of sparse points based SLAM. We build a lightweight back-end map which consists of a few planes and map points to achieve efficient bundle adjustment (BA) with an equal or better accuracy. We use homography constraints to eliminate the parameters of numerous plane points in the optimization and reduce the complexity of BA. We separate the parameters and measurements in homography and point-to-plane constraints and compress the measurements part to further effectively improve the speed of BA. We also integrate the plane information into the whole system to realize robust planar feature extraction, data association, and global consistent planar reconstruction. Finally, we perform an ablation study and compare our method with similar methods in simulation and real environment data. Our system achieves obvious advantages in accuracy and efficiency. Even if the plane parameters are involved in the optimization, we effectively simplify the back-end map by using planar structures. The global bundle adjustment is nearly 2 times faster than the sparse points based SLAM algorithm.      
### 130.Removing Batch Normalization Boosts Adversarial Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01156.pdf)
>  Adversarial training (AT) defends deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. One challenge that limits its practical application is the performance degradation on clean samples. A major bottleneck identified by previous works is the widely used batch normalization (BN), which struggles to model the different statistics of clean and adversarial training samples in AT. Although the dominant approach is to extend BN to capture this mixture of distribution, we propose to completely eliminate this bottleneck by removing all BN layers in AT. Our normalizer-free robust training (NoFrost) method extends recent advances in normalizer-free networks to AT for its unexplored advantage on handling the mixture distribution challenge. We show that NoFrost achieves adversarial robustness with only a minor sacrifice on clean sample accuracy. On ImageNet with ResNet50, NoFrost achieves $74.06\%$ clean accuracy, which drops merely $2.00\%$ from standard training. In contrast, BN-based AT obtains $59.28\%$ clean accuracy, suffering a significant $16.78\%$ drop from standard training. In addition, NoFrost achieves a $23.56\%$ adversarial robustness against PGD attack, which improves the $13.57\%$ robustness in BN-based AT. We observe better model smoothness and larger decision margins from NoFrost, which make the models less sensitive to input perturbations and thus more robust. Moreover, when incorporating more data augmentations into NoFrost, it achieves comprehensive robustness against multiple distribution shifts.

### 131.The Gesture Authoring Space: Authoring Customised Hand Gestures for Grasping Virtual Objects in Immersive Virtual Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01092.pdf)
>  Natural user interfaces are on the rise. Manufacturers for Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed Reality head mounted displays are increasingly integrating new sensors into their consumer grade products, allowing gesture recognition without additional hardware. This offers new possibilities for bare handed interaction within virtual environments. This work proposes a hand gesture authoring tool for object specific grab gestures allowing virtual objects to be grabbed as in the real world. The presented solution uses template matching for gesture recognition and requires no technical knowledge to design and create custom tailored hand gestures. In a user study, the proposed approach is compared with the pinch gesture and the controller for grasping virtual objects. The different grasping techniques are compared in terms of accuracy, task completion time, usability, and naturalness. The study showed that gestures created with the proposed approach are perceived by users as a more natural input modality than the others.      
### 132.Patient-specific modelling, simulation and real time processing for constrictive respiratory diseases  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01082.pdf)
>  Asthma is a common chronic disease of the respiratory system causing significant disability and societal burden. It affects over 500 million people worldwide and generates costs exceeding $USD 56 billion in 2011 in the United States. Managing asthma involves controlling symptoms, preventing exacerbations, and maintaining lung function. Improving asthma control affects the daily life of patients and is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations and lung function impairment, reduces the cost of asthma care and indirect costs associated with reduced productivity. Understanding the complex dynamics of the pulmonary system and the lung's response to disease, injury, and treatment is fundamental to the advancement of Asthma treatment. Computational models of the respiratory system seek to provide a theoretical framework to understand the interaction between structure and function. Their application can improve pulmonary medicine by a patient-specific approach to medicinal methodologies optimizing the delivery given the personalized geometry and personalized ventilation patterns while introducing a patient-specific technique that maximizes drug delivery. A three-fold objective addressed within this dissertation becomes prominent at this point. The first part refers to the comprehension of pulmonary pathophysiology and the mechanics of Asthma and subsequently of constrictive pulmonary conditions in general. The second part refers to the design and implementation of tools that facilitate personalized medicine to improve delivery and effectiveness. Finally, the third part refers to the self-management of the condition, meaning that medical personnel and patients have access to tools and methods that allow the first party to easily track the course of the condition and the second party, i.e. the patient to easily self-manage it alleviating the significant burden from the health system.      
### 133.Training Patch Analysis and Mining Skills for Image Restoration Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01075.pdf)
>  There have been numerous image restoration methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most of the literature on this topic focused on the network architecture and loss functions, while less detailed on the training methods. Hence, some of the works are not easily reproducible because it is required to know the hidden training skills to obtain the same results. To be specific with the training dataset, few works discussed how to prepare and order the training image patches. Moreover, it requires a high cost to capture new datasets to train a restoration network for the real-world scene. Hence, we believe it is necessary to study the preparation and selection of training data. In this regard, we present an analysis of the training patches and explore the consequences of different patch extraction methods. Eventually, we propose a guideline for the patch extraction from given training images.      
### 134.Variational Deep Image Restoration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01074.pdf)
>  This paper presents a new variational inference framework for image restoration and a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that can solve the restoration problems described by the proposed framework. Earlier CNN-based image restoration methods primarily focused on network architecture design or training strategy with non-blind scenarios where the degradation models are known or assumed. For a step closer to real-world applications, CNNs are also blindly trained with the whole dataset, including diverse degradations. However, the conditional distribution of a high-quality image given a diversely degraded one is too complicated to be learned by a single CNN. Therefore, there have also been some methods that provide additional prior information to train a CNN. Unlike previous approaches, we focus more on the objective of restoration based on the Bayesian perspective and how to reformulate the objective. Specifically, our method relaxes the original posterior inference problem to better manageable sub-problems and thus behaves like a divide-and-conquer scheme. As a result, the proposed framework boosts the performance of several restoration problems compared to the previous ones. Specifically, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance on Gaussian denoising, real-world noise reduction, blind image super-resolution, and JPEG compression artifacts reduction.      
### 135.NP-Match: When Neural Processes meet Semi-Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01066.pdf)
>  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been widely explored in recent years, and it is an effective way of leveraging unlabeled data to reduce the reliance on labeled data. In this work, we adjust neural processes (NPs) to the semi-supervised image classification task, resulting in a new method named NP-Match. NP-Match is suited to this task for two reasons. Firstly, NP-Match implicitly compares data points when making predictions, and as a result, the prediction of each unlabeled data point is affected by the labeled data points that are similar to it, which improves the quality of pseudo-labels. Secondly, NP-Match is able to estimate uncertainty that can be used as a tool for selecting unlabeled samples with reliable pseudo-labels. Compared with uncertainty-based SSL methods implemented with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, NP-Match estimates uncertainty with much less computational overhead, which can save time at both the training and the testing phases. We conducted extensive experiments on four public datasets, and NP-Match outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) results or achieves competitive results on them, which shows the effectiveness of NP-Match and its potential for SSL.      
### 136.Chat-to-Design: AI Assisted Personalized Fashion Design  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01058.pdf)
>  In this demo, we present Chat-to-Design, a new multimodal interaction system for personalized fashion design. Compared to classic systems that recommend apparel based on keywords, Chat-to-Design enables users to design clothes in two steps: 1) coarse-grained selection via conversation and 2) fine-grained editing via an interactive interface. It encompasses three sub-systems to deliver an immersive user experience: A conversation system empowered by natural language understanding to accept users' requests and manages dialogs; A multimodal fashion retrieval system empowered by a large-scale pretrained language-image network to retrieve requested apparel; A fashion design system empowered by emerging generative techniques to edit attributes of retrieved clothes.      
### 137.Facial Image Reconstruction from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging via GAN Inversion with Improved Attribute Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01011.pdf)
>  Neuroscience studies have revealed that the brain encodes visual content and embeds information in neural activity. Recently, deep learning techniques have facilitated attempts to address visual reconstructions by mapping brain activity to image stimuli using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, none of these studies have considered the semantic meaning of latent code in image space. Omitting semantic information could potentially limit the performance. In this study, we propose a new framework to reconstruct facial images from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. With this framework, the GAN inversion is first applied to train an image encoder to extract latent codes in image space, which are then bridged to fMRI data using linear transformation. Following the attributes identified from fMRI data using an attribute classifier, the direction in which to manipulate attributes is decided and the attribute manipulator adjusts the latent code to improve the consistency between the seen image and the reconstructed image. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed framework accomplishes two goals: (1) reconstructing clear facial images from fMRI data and (2) maintaining the consistency of semantic characteristics.      
### 138.Stabilizing Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning from Pixels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00986.pdf)
>  Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) from pixel observations is notoriously unstable. As a result, many successful algorithms must combine different domain-specific practices and auxiliary losses to learn meaningful behaviors in complex environments. In this work, we provide novel analysis demonstrating that these instabilities arise from performing temporal-difference learning with a convolutional encoder and low-magnitude rewards. We show that this new visual deadly triad causes unstable training and premature convergence to degenerate solutions, a phenomenon we name catastrophic self-overfitting. Based on our analysis, we propose A-LIX, a method providing adaptive regularization to the encoder's gradients that explicitly prevents the occurrence of catastrophic self-overfitting using a dual objective. By applying A-LIX, we significantly outperform the prior state-of-the-art on the DeepMind Control and Atari 100k benchmarks without any data augmentation or auxiliary losses.      
### 139.Features of a Splashing Drop on a Solid Surface and the Temporal Evolution extracted through Image-Sequence Classification using an Interpretable Feedforward Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00971.pdf)
>  This paper reports the features of a splashing drop on a solid surface and the temporal evolution, which are extracted through image-sequence classification using a highly interpretable feedforward neural network (FNN) with zero hidden layer. The image sequences used for training-validation and testing of the FNN show the early-stage deformation of milli-sized ethanol drops that impact a hydrophilic glass substrate with the Weber number ranges between 31-474 (splashing threshold about 173). Specific videographing conditions and digital image processing are performed to ensure the high similarity among the image sequences. As a result, the trained FNNs achieved a test accuracy higher than 96%. Remarkably, the feature extraction shows that the trained FNN identifies the temporal evolution of the ejected secondary droplets around the aerodynamically lifted lamella and the relatively high contour of the main body as the features of a splashing drop, while the relatively short and thick lamella as the feature of a nonsplashing drop. The physical interpretation for these features and their respective temporal evolution have been identified except for the difference in contour height of the main body between splashing and nonsplashing drops. The observation reported in this study is important for the development of a data-driven simulation for modeling the deformation of a splashing drop during the impact on a solid surface.      
### 140.PS$^2$F: Polarized Spiral Point Spread Function for Single-Shot 3D Sensing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00945.pdf)
>  We propose a compact snapshot monocular depth estimation technique that relies on an engineered point spread function (PSF). Traditional approaches used in microscopic super-resolution imaging, such as the Double-Helix PSF (DHPSF), are ill-suited for scenes that are more complex than a sparse set of point light sources. We show, using the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB), that separating the two lobes of the DHPSF and thereby capturing two separate images leads to a dramatic increase in depth accuracy. A unique property of the phase mask used for generating the DHPSF is that a separation of the phase mask into two halves leads to a spatial separation of the two lobes. We leverage this property to build a compact polarization-based optical setup, where we place two orthogonal linear polarizers on each half of the DHPSF phase mask and then capture the resulting image with a polarization sensitive camera. Results from simulations and a lab prototype demonstrate that our technique achieves up to $50\%$ lower depth error compared to state-of-the-art designs including the DHPSF, and the Tetrapod PSF, with little to no loss in spatial resolution.      
### 141.Domain-Adaptive 3D Medical Image Synthesis: An Efficient Unsupervised Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00844.pdf)
>  Medical image synthesis has attracted increasing attention because it could generate missing image data, improving diagnosis and benefits many downstream tasks. However, so far the developed synthesis model is not adaptive to unseen data distribution that presents domain shift, limiting its applicability in clinical routine. This work focuses on exploring domain adaptation (DA) of 3D image-to-image synthesis models. First, we highlight the technical difference in DA between classification, segmentation and synthesis models. Second, we present a novel efficient adaptation approach based on 2D variational autoencoder which approximates 3D distributions. Third, we present empirical studies on the effect of the amount of adaptation data and the key hyper-parameters. Our results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the synthesis accuracy on unseen domains in a 3D setting.

### 142.Simulating reaction time for Eureka effect in visual object recognition using artificial neural network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00815.pdf)
>  The human brain can recognize objects hidden in even severely degraded images after observing them for a while, which is known as a type of Eureka effect, possibly associated with human creativity. A previous psychological study suggests that the basis of this "Eureka recognition" is neural processes of coincidence of multiple stochastic activities. Here we constructed an artificial-neural-network-based model that simulated the characteristics of the human Eureka recognition.      
### 143.Object Representations as Fixed Points: Training Iterative Refinement Algorithms with Implicit Differentiation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00787.pdf)
>  Iterative refinement -- start with a random guess, then iteratively improve the guess -- is a useful paradigm for representation learning because it offers a way to break symmetries among equally plausible explanations for the data. This property enables the application of such methods to infer representations of sets of entities, such as objects in physical scenes, structurally resembling clustering algorithms in latent space. However, most prior works differentiate through the unrolled refinement process, which can make optimization challenging. We observe that such methods can be made differentiable by means of the implicit function theorem, and develop an implicit differentiation approach that improves the stability and tractability of training by decoupling the forward and backward passes. This connection enables us to apply advances in optimizing implicit layers to not only improve the optimization of the slot attention module in SLATE, a state-of-the-art method for learning entity representations, but do so with constant space and time complexity in backpropagation and only one additional line of code.      
### 144.Test-time Adaptation with Calibration of Medical Image Classification Nets for Label Distribution Shift  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00769.pdf)
>  Class distribution plays an important role in learning deep classifiers. When the proportion of each class in the test set differs from the training set, the performance of classification nets usually degrades. Such a label distribution shift problem is common in medical diagnosis since the prevalence of disease vary over location and time. In this paper, we propose the first method to tackle label shift for medical image classification, which effectively adapt the model learned from a single training label distribution to arbitrary unknown test label distribution. Our approach innovates distribution calibration to learn multiple representative classifiers, which are capable of handling different one-dominating-class distributions. When given a test image, the diverse classifiers are dynamically aggregated via the consistency-driven test-time adaptation, to deal with the unknown test label distribution. We validate our method on two important medical image classification tasks including liver fibrosis staging and COVID-19 severity prediction. Our experiments clearly show the decreased model performance under label shift. With our method, model performance significantly improves on all the test datasets with different label shifts for both medical image diagnosis tasks.      
### 145.American == White in Multimodal Language-and-Image AI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00691.pdf)
>  Three state-of-the-art language-and-image AI models, CLIP, SLIP, and BLIP, are evaluated for evidence of a bias previously observed in social and experimental psychology: equating American identity with being White. Embedding association tests (EATs) using standardized images of self-identified Asian, Black, Latina/o, and White individuals from the Chicago Face Database (CFD) reveal that White individuals are more associated with collective in-group words than are Asian, Black, or Latina/o individuals. In assessments of three core aspects of American identity reported by social psychologists, single-category EATs reveal that images of White individuals are more associated with patriotism and with being born in America, but that, consistent with prior findings in psychology, White individuals are associated with being less likely to treat people of all races and backgrounds equally. Three downstream machine learning tasks demonstrate biases associating American with White. In a visual question answering task using BLIP, 97% of White individuals are identified as American, compared to only 3% of Asian individuals. When asked in what state the individual depicted lives in, the model responds China 53% of the time for Asian individuals, but always with an American state for White individuals. In an image captioning task, BLIP remarks upon the race of Asian individuals as much as 36% of the time, but never remarks upon race for White individuals. Finally, provided with an initialization image from the CFD and the text "an American person," a synthetic image generator (VQGAN) using the text-based guidance of CLIP lightens the skin tone of individuals of all races (by 35% for Black individuals, based on pixel brightness). The results indicate that biases equating American identity with being White are learned by language-and-image AI, and propagate to downstream applications of such models.      
### 146.Identification of Binary Neutron Star Mergers in Gravitational-Wave Data Using YOLO One-Shot Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00591.pdf)
>  We demonstrate the application of the YOLOv5 model, a general purpose convolution-based single-shot object detection model, in the task of detecting binary neutron star (BNS) coalescence events from gravitational-wave data of current generation interferometer detectors. We also present a thorough explanation of the synthetic data generation and preparation tasks based on approximant waveform models used for the model training, validation and testing steps. Using this approach, we achieve mean average precision ($\text{mAP}_{[0.50]}$) values of 0.945 for a single class validation dataset and as high as 0.978 for test datasets. Moreover, the trained model is successful in identifying the GW170817 event in the LIGO H1 detector data. The identification of this event is also possible for the LIGO L1 detector data with an additional pre-processing step, without the need of removing the large glitch in the final stages of the inspiral. The detection of the GW190425 event is less successful, which attests to performance degradation with the signal-to-noise ratio. Our study indicates that the YOLOv5 model is an interesting approach for first-stage detection alarm pipelines and, when integrated in more complex pipelines, for real-time inference of physical source parameters.      
### 147.Feature-selected Graph Spatial Attention Network for Addictive Brain-Networks Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00583.pdf)
>  Functional alterations in the relevant neural circuits occur from drug addiction over a certain period. And these significant alterations are also revealed by analyzing fMRI. However, because of fMRI's high dimensionality and poor signal-to-noise ratio, it is challenging to encode efficient and robust brain regional embeddings for both graph-level identification and region-level biomarkers detection tasks between nicotine addiction (NA) and healthy control (HC) groups. In this work, we represent the fMRI of the rat brain as a graph with biological attributes and propose a novel feature-selected graph spatial attention network(FGSAN) to extract the biomarkers of addiction and identify from these brain networks. Specially, a graph spatial attention encoder is employed to capture the features of spatiotemporal brain networks with spatial information. The method simultaneously adopts a Bayesian feature selection strategy to optimize the model and improve classification task by constraining features. Experiments on an addiction-related neural imaging dataset show that the proposed model can obtain superior performance and detect interpretable biomarkers associated with addiction-relevant neural circuits.      
### 148.Prioritized Training on Points that are Learnable, Worth Learning, and Not Yet Learnt  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07137.pdf)
>  Training on web-scale data can take months. But most computation and time is wasted on redundant and noisy points that are already learnt or not learnable. To accelerate training, we introduce Reducible Holdout Loss Selection (RHO-LOSS), a simple but principled technique which selects approximately those points for training that most reduce the model's generalization loss. As a result, RHO-LOSS mitigates the weaknesses of existing data selection methods: techniques from the optimization literature typically select 'hard' (e.g. high loss) points, but such points are often noisy (not learnable) or less task-relevant. Conversely, curriculum learning prioritizes 'easy' points, but such points need not be trained on once learned. In contrast, RHO-LOSS selects points that are learnable, worth learning, and not yet learnt. RHO-LOSS trains in far fewer steps than prior art, improves accuracy, and speeds up training on a wide range of datasets, hyperparameters, and architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and BERT). On the large web-scraped image dataset Clothing-1M, RHO-LOSS trains in 18x fewer steps and reaches 2% higher final accuracy than uniform data shuffling.
