### 1.Unsupervised Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03649.pdf)
>  Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP have shown great progress in zero-shot transfer learning. This new paradigm uses large-scale image-text pairs for training and aligns images and texts in a common embedding space. In the inference stage, the proper text description, known as prompt, needs to be carefully designed for zero-shot transfer. To avoid laborious prompt engineering and simultaneously improve transfer performance, recent works such as CoOp, CLIP-Adapter and Tip-Adapter propose to adapt vision-language models for downstream image recognition tasks by either optimizing the continuous prompt representations or training an additional adapter network on top of the pre-trained vision-language models on a small set of labeled data. Though promising improvements are achieved, using labeled images from target datasets may violate the intention of zero-shot transfer of pre-trained vision-language models. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) framework, which does not require any annotations of the target dataset, to improve the zero-shot transfer of CLIP-like vision-language models. Experimentally, for zero-shot transfer, our UPL outperforms original CLIP with prompt engineering and on ImageNet as well as other 10 datasets. An enhanced version of UPL is even on par with the 8-shot CoOp and the 8-shot TIP-Adapter on most datasets while our method does not need any labeled images for training.

### 2.SunStage: Portrait Reconstruction and Relighting using the Sun as a Light Stage  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03648.pdf)
>  Outdoor portrait photographs are often marred by the harsh shadows cast under direct sunlight. To resolve this, one can use post-capture lighting manipulation techniques, but these methods either require complex hardware (e.g., a light stage) to capture each individual, or rely on image-based priors and thus fail to reconstruct many of the subtle facial details that vary from person to person. In this paper, we present SunStage, a system for accurate, individually-tailored, and lightweight reconstruction of facial geometry and reflectance that can be used for general portrait relighting with cast shadows. Our method only requires the user to capture a selfie video outdoors, rotating in place, and uses the varying angles between the sun and the face as constraints in the joint reconstruction of facial geometry, reflectance properties, and lighting parameters. Aside from relighting, we show that our reconstruction can be used for applications like reflectance editing and view synthesis.

### 3.Adapting CLIP For Phrase Localization Without Further Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03647.pdf)
>  Supervised or weakly supervised methods for phrase localization (textual grounding) either rely on human annotations or some other supervised models, e.g., object detectors. Obtaining these annotations is labor-intensive and may be difficult to scale in practice. We propose to leverage recent advances in contrastive language-vision models, CLIP, pre-trained on image and caption pairs collected from the internet. In its original form, CLIP only outputs an image-level embedding without any spatial resolution. We adapt CLIP to generate high-resolution spatial feature maps. Importantly, we can extract feature maps from both ViT and ResNet CLIP model while maintaining the semantic properties of an image embedding. This provides a natural framework for phrase localization. Our method for phrase localization requires no human annotations or additional training. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing no-training methods in zero-shot phrase localization, and in some cases, it even outperforms supervised methods.

### 4.FineDiving: A Fine-grained Dataset for Procedure-aware Action Quality Assessment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03646.pdf)
>  Most existing action quality assessment methods rely on the deep features of an entire video to predict the score, which is less reliable due to the non-transparent inference process and poor interpretability. We argue that understanding both high-level semantics and internal temporal structures of actions in competitive sports videos is the key to making predictions accurate and interpretable. Towards this goal, we construct a new fine-grained dataset, called FineDiving, developed on diverse diving events with detailed annotations on action procedures. We also propose a procedure-aware approach for action quality assessment, learned by a new Temporal Segmentation Attention module. Specifically, we propose to parse pairwise query and exemplar action instances into consecutive steps with diverse semantic and temporal correspondences. The procedure-aware cross-attention is proposed to learn embeddings between query and exemplar steps to discover their semantic, spatial, and temporal correspondences, and further serve for fine-grained contrastive regression to derive a reliable scoring mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods with better interpretability.

### 5.DaViT: Dual Attention Vision Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03645.pdf)
>  In this work, we introduce Dual Attention Vision Transformers (DaViT), a simple yet effective vision transformer architecture that is able to capture global context while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose approaching the problem from an orthogonal angle: exploiting self-attention mechanisms with both "spatial tokens" and "channel tokens". With spatial tokens, the spatial dimension defines the token scope, and the channel dimension defines the token feature dimension. With channel tokens, we have the inverse: the channel dimension defines the token scope, and the spatial dimension defines the token feature dimension. We further group tokens along the sequence direction for both spatial and channel tokens to maintain the linear complexity of the entire model. We show that these two self-attentions complement each other: (i) since each channel token contains an abstract representation of the entire image, the channel attention naturally captures global interactions and representations by taking all spatial positions into account when computing attention scores between channels; (ii) the spatial attention refines the local representations by performing fine-grained interactions across spatial locations, which in turn helps the global information modeling in channel attention. Extensive experiments show our DaViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on four different tasks with efficient computations. Without extra data, DaViT-Tiny, DaViT-Small, and DaViT-Base achieve 82.8%, 84.2%, and 84.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 28.3M, 49.7M, and 87.9M parameters, respectively. When we further scale up DaViT with 1.5B weakly supervised image and text pairs, DaViT-Gaint reaches 90.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

### 6.Total Variation Optimization Layers for Computer Vision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03643.pdf)
>  Optimization within a layer of a deep-net has emerged as a new direction for deep-net layer design. However, there are two main challenges when applying these layers to computer vision tasks: (a) which optimization problem within a layer is useful?; (b) how to ensure that computation within a layer remains efficient? To study question (a), in this work, we propose total variation (TV) minimization as a layer for computer vision. Motivated by the success of total variation in image processing, we hypothesize that TV as a layer provides useful inductive bias for deep-nets too. We study this hypothesis on five computer vision tasks: image classification, weakly supervised object localization, edge-preserving smoothing, edge detection, and image denoising, improving over existing baselines. To achieve these results we had to address question (b): we developed a GPU-based projected-Newton method which is $37\times$ faster than existing solutions.      
### 7.Pre-train, Self-train, Distill: A simple recipe for Supersizing 3D Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03642.pdf)
>  Our work learns a unified model for single-view 3D reconstruction of objects from hundreds of semantic categories. As a scalable alternative to direct 3D supervision, our work relies on segmented image collections for learning 3D of generic categories. Unlike prior works that use similar supervision but learn independent category-specific models from scratch, our approach of learning a unified model simplifies the training process while also allowing the model to benefit from the common structure across categories. Using image collections from standard recognition datasets, we show that our approach allows learning 3D inference for over 150 object categories. We evaluate using two datasets and qualitatively and quantitatively show that our unified reconstruction approach improves over prior category-specific reconstruction baselines. Our final 3D reconstruction model is also capable of zero-shot inference on images from unseen object categories and we empirically show that increasing the number of training categories improves the reconstruction quality.      
### 8.Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation with Generative Prior  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03641.pdf)
>  Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims to learn the translation between two visual domains without paired data. Despite the recent progress in image translation models, it remains challenging to build mappings between complex domains with drastic visual discrepancies. In this work, we present a novel framework, Generative Prior-guided UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation (GP-UNIT), to improve the overall quality and applicability of the translation algorithm. Our key insight is to leverage the generative prior from pre-trained class-conditional GANs (e.g., BigGAN) to learn rich content correspondences across various domains. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine scheme: we first distill the generative prior to capture a robust coarse-level content representation that can link objects at an abstract semantic level, based on which fine-level content features are adaptively learned for more accurate multi-level content correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our versatile framework over state-of-the-art methods in robust, high-quality and diversified translations, even for challenging and distant domains.      
### 9.Long Video Generation with Time-Agnostic VQGAN and Time-Sensitive Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03638.pdf)
>  Videos are created to express emotion, exchange information, and share experiences. Video synthesis has intrigued researchers for a long time. Despite the rapid progress driven by advances in visual synthesis, most existing studies focus on improving the frames' quality and the transitions between them, while little progress has been made in generating longer videos. In this paper, we present a method that builds on 3D-VQGAN and transformers to generate videos with thousands of frames. Our evaluation shows that our model trained on 16-frame video clips from standard benchmarks such as UCF-101, Sky Time-lapse, and Taichi-HD datasets can generate diverse, coherent, and high-quality long videos. We also showcase conditional extensions of our approach for generating meaningful long videos by incorporating temporal information with text and audio.

### 10.SurroundDepth: Entangling Surrounding Views for Self-Supervised Multi-Camera Depth Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03636.pdf)
>  Depth estimation from images serves as the fundamental step of 3D perception for autonomous driving and is an economical alternative to expensive depth sensors like LiDAR. The temporal photometric consistency enables self-supervised depth estimation without labels, further facilitating its application. However, most existing methods predict the depth solely based on each monocular image and ignore the correlations among multiple surrounding cameras, which are typically available for modern self-driving vehicles. In this paper, we propose a SurroundDepth method to incorporate the information from multiple surrounding views to predict depth maps across cameras. Specifically, we employ a joint network to process all the surrounding views and propose a cross-view transformer to effectively fuse the information from multiple views. We apply cross-view self-attention to efficiently enable the global interactions between multi-camera feature maps. Different from self-supervised monocular depth estimation, we are able to predict real-world scales given multi-camera extrinsic matrices. To achieve this goal, we adopt structure-from-motion to extract scale-aware pseudo depths to pretrain the models. Further, instead of predicting the ego-motion of each individual camera, we estimate a universal ego-motion of the vehicle and transfer it to each view to achieve multi-view consistency. In experiments, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging multi-camera depth estimation datasets DDAD and nuScenes.      
### 11.Zero-Shot Category-Level Object Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03635.pdf)
>  Object pose estimation is an important component of most vision pipelines for embodied agents, as well as in 3D vision more generally. In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the pose of novel object categories in a zero-shot manner. This extends much of the existing literature by removing the need for pose-labelled datasets or category-specific CAD models for training or inference. Specifically, we make the following contributions. First, we formalise the zero-shot, category-level pose estimation problem and frame it in a way that is most applicable to real-world embodied agents. Secondly, we propose a novel method based on semantic correspondences from a self-supervised vision transformer to solve the pose estimation problem. We further re-purpose the recent CO3D dataset to present a controlled and realistic test setting. Finally, we demonstrate that all baselines for our proposed task perform poorly, and show that our method provides a six-fold improvement in average rotation accuracy at 30 degrees.

### 12.Class-Incremental Learning with Strong Pre-trained Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03634.pdf)
>  Class-incremental learning (CIL) has been widely studied under the setting of starting from a small number of classes (base classes). Instead, we explore an understudied real-world setting of CIL that starts with a strong model pre-trained on a large number of base classes. We hypothesize that a strong base model can provide a good representation for novel classes and incremental learning can be done with small adaptations. We propose a 2-stage training scheme, i) feature augmentation -- cloning part of the backbone and fine-tuning it on the novel data, and ii) fusion -- combining the base and novel classifiers into a unified classifier. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods on the large-scale ImageNet dataset (e.g. +10% overall accuracy than the best). We also propose and analyze understudied practical CIL scenarios, such as base-novel overlap with distribution shift. Our proposed method is robust and generalizes to all analyzed CIL settings.      
### 13.Unified Contrastive Learning in Image-Text-Label Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03610.pdf)
>  Visual recognition is recently learned via either supervised learning on human-annotated image-label data or language-image contrastive learning with webly-crawled image-text pairs. While supervised learning may result in a more discriminative representation, language-image pretraining shows unprecedented zero-shot recognition capability, largely due to the different properties of data sources and learning objectives. In this work, we introduce a new formulation by combining the two data sources into a common image-text-label space. In this space, we propose a new learning paradigm, called Unified Contrastive Learning (UniCL) with a single learning objective to seamlessly prompt the synergy of two data types. Extensive experiments show that our UniCL is an effective way of learning semantically rich yet discriminative representations, universally for image recognition in zero-shot, linear-probe, fully finetuning and transfer learning scenarios. Particularly, it attains gains up to 9.2% and 14.5% in average on zero-shot recognition benchmarks over the language-image contrastive learning and supervised learning methods, respectively. In linear probe setting, it also boosts the performance over the two methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively. Our study also indicates that UniCL stand-alone is a good learner on pure image-label data, rivaling the supervised learning methods across three image classification datasets and two types of vision backbones, ResNet and Swin Transformer.

### 14.Pin the Memory: Learning to Generalize Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03609.pdf)
>  The rise of deep neural networks has led to several breakthroughs for semantic segmentation. In spite of this, a model trained on source domain often fails to work properly in new challenging domains, that is directly concerned with the generalization capability of the model. In this paper, we present a novel memory-guided domain generalization method for semantic segmentation based on meta-learning framework. Especially, our method abstracts the conceptual knowledge of semantic classes into categorical memory which is constant beyond the domains. Upon the meta-learning concept, we repeatedly train memory-guided networks and simulate virtual test to 1) learn how to memorize a domain-agnostic and distinct information of classes and 2) offer an externally settled memory as a class-guidance to reduce the ambiguity of representation in the test data of arbitrary unseen domain. To this end, we also propose memory divergence and feature cohesion losses, which encourage to learn memory reading and update processes for category-aware domain generalization. Extensive experiments for semantic segmentation demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method over state-of-the-art works on various benchmarks.      
### 15.AutoRF: Learning 3D Object Radiance Fields from Single View Observations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03593.pdf)
>  We introduce AutoRF - a new approach for learning neural 3D object representations where each object in the training set is observed by only a single view. This setting is in stark contrast to the majority of existing works that leverage multiple views of the same object, employ explicit priors during training, or require pixel-perfect annotations. To address this challenging setting, we propose to learn a normalized, object-centric representation whose embedding describes and disentangles shape, appearance, and pose. Each encoding provides well-generalizable, compact information about the object of interest, which is decoded in a single-shot into a new target view, thus enabling novel view synthesis. We further improve the reconstruction quality by optimizing shape and appearance codes at test time by fitting the representation tightly to the input image. In a series of experiments, we show that our method generalizes well to unseen objects, even across different datasets of challenging real-world street scenes such as nuScenes, KITTI, and Mapillary Metropolis.      
### 16.Emotional Speech Recognition with Pre-trained Deep Visual Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03561.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a new methodology for emotional speech recognition using visual deep neural network models. We employ the transfer learning capabilities of the pre-trained computer vision deep models to have a mandate for the emotion recognition in speech task. In order to achieve that, we propose to use a composite set of acoustic features and a procedure to convert them into images. Besides, we present a training paradigm for these models taking into consideration the different characteristics between acoustic-based images and regular ones. In our experiments, we use the pre-trained VGG-16 model and test the overall methodology on the Berlin EMO-DB dataset for speaker-independent emotion recognition. We evaluate the proposed model on the full list of the seven emotions and the results set a new state-of-the-art.      
### 17.Practical Digital Disguises: Leveraging Face Swaps to Protect Patient Privacy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03559.pdf)
>  With rapid advancements in image generation technology, face swapping for privacy protection has emerged as an active area of research. The ultimate benefit is improved access to video datasets, e.g. in healthcare settings. Recent literature has proposed deep network-based architectures to perform facial swaps and reported the associated reduction in facial recognition accuracy. However, there is not much reporting on how well these methods preserve the types of semantic information needed for the privatized videos to remain useful for their intended application. Our main contribution is a novel end-to-end face swapping pipeline for recorded videos of standardized assessments of autism symptoms in children. Through this design, we are the first to provide a methodology for assessing the privacy-utility trade-offs for the face swapping approach to patient privacy protection. Our methodology can show, for example, that current deep network based face swapping is bottle-necked by face detection in real world videos, and the extent to which gaze and expression information is preserved by face swaps relative to baseline privatization methods such as blurring.      
### 18.End-to-End Zero-Shot HOI Detection via Vision and Language Knowledge Distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03541.pdf)
>  Most existing Human-Object Interaction~(HOI) Detection methods rely heavily on full annotations with predefined HOI categories, which is limited in diversity and costly to scale further. We aim at advancing zero-shot HOI detection to detect both seen and unseen HOIs simultaneously. The fundamental challenges are to discover potential human-object pairs and identify novel HOI categories. To overcome the above challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end zero-shot HOI Detection (EoID) framework via vision-language knowledge distillation. We first design an Interactive Score module combined with a Two-stage Bipartite Matching algorithm to achieve interaction distinguishment for human-object pairs in an action-agnostic manner. Then we transfer the distribution of action probability from the pretrained vision-language teacher as well as the seen ground truth to the HOI model to attain zero-shot HOI classification. Extensive experiments on HICO-Det dataset demonstrate that our model discovers potential interactive pairs and enables the recognition of unseen HOIs. Finally, our method outperforms the previous SOTA by 8.92% on unseen mAP and 10.18% on overall mAP under UA setting, by 6.02% on unseen mAP and 9.1% on overall mAP under UC setting. Moreover, our method is generalizable to large-scale object detection data to further scale up the action sets.

### 19.Efficient Multiscale Object-based Superpixel Framework  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03533.pdf)
>  Superpixel segmentation can be used as an intermediary step in many applications, often to improve object delineation and reduce computer workload. However, classical methods do not incorporate information about the desired object. Deep-learning-based approaches consider object information, but their delineation performance depends on data annotation. Additionally, the computational time of object-based methods is usually much higher than desired. In this work, we propose a novel superpixel framework, named Superpixels through Iterative CLEarcutting (SICLE), which exploits object information being able to generate a multiscale segmentation on-the-fly. SICLE starts off from seed oversampling and repeats optimal connectivity-based superpixel delineation and object-based seed removal until a desired number of superpixels is reached. It generalizes recent superpixel methods, surpassing them and other state-of-the-art approaches in efficiency and effectiveness according to multiple delineation metrics.      
### 20.Many-to-many Splatting for Efficient Video Frame Interpolation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03513.pdf)
>  Motion-based video frame interpolation commonly relies on optical flow to warp pixels from the inputs to the desired interpolation instant. Yet due to the inherent challenges of motion estimation (e.g. occlusions and discontinuities), most state-of-the-art interpolation approaches require subsequent refinement of the warped result to generate satisfying outputs, which drastically decreases the efficiency for multi-frame interpolation. In this work, we propose a fully differentiable Many-to-Many (M2M) splatting framework to interpolate frames efficiently. Specifically, given a frame pair, we estimate multiple bidirectional flows to directly forward warp the pixels to the desired time step, and then fuse any overlapping pixels. In doing so, each source pixel renders multiple target pixels and each target pixel can be synthesized from a larger area of visual context. This establishes a many-to-many splatting scheme with robustness to artifacts like holes. Moreover, for each input frame pair, M2M only performs motion estimation once and has a minuscule computational overhead when interpolating an arbitrary number of in-between frames, hence achieving fast multi-frame interpolation. We conducted extensive experiments to analyze M2M, and found that it significantly improves efficiency while maintaining high effectiveness.      
### 21.ProbNVS: Fast Novel View Synthesis with Learned Probability-Guided Sampling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03476.pdf)
>  Existing state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods rely on either fairly accurate 3D geometry estimation or sampling of the entire space for neural volumetric rendering, which limit the overall efficiency. In order to improve the rendering efficiency by reducing sampling points without sacrificing rendering quality, we propose to build a novel view synthesis framework based on learned MVS priors that enables general, fast and photo-realistic view synthesis simultaneously. Specifically, fewer but important points are sampled under the guidance of depth probability distributions extracted from the learned MVS architecture. Based on the learned probability-guided sampling, a neural volume rendering module is elaborately devised to fully aggregate source view information as well as the learned scene structures to synthesize photorealistic target view images. Finally, the rendering results in uncertain, occluded and unreferenced regions can be further improved by incorporating a confidence-aware refinement module. Experiments show that our method achieves 15 to 40 times faster rendering compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong generalization capacity and comparable high-quality novel view synthesis performance.      
### 22.Solving ImageNet: a Unified Scheme for Training any Backbone to Top Results  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03475.pdf)
>  ImageNet serves as the primary dataset for evaluating the quality of computer-vision models. The common practice today is training each architecture with a tailor-made scheme, designed and tuned by an expert. In this paper, we present a unified scheme for training any backbone on ImageNet. The scheme, named USI (Unified Scheme for ImageNet), is based on knowledge distillation and modern tricks. It requires no adjustments or hyper-parameters tuning between different models, and is efficient in terms of training times. We test USI on a wide variety of architectures, including CNNs, Transformers, Mobile-oriented and MLP-only. On all models tested, USI outperforms previous state-of-the-art results. Hence, we are able to transform training on ImageNet from an expert-oriented task to an automatic seamless routine. Since USI accepts any backbone and trains it to top results, it also enables to perform methodical comparisons, and identify the most efficient backbones along the speed-accuracy Pareto curve.

### 23.Video Diffusion Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03458.pdf)
>  Generating temporally coherent high fidelity video is an important milestone in generative modeling research. We make progress towards this milestone by proposing a diffusion model for video generation that shows very promising initial results. Our model is a natural extension of the standard image diffusion architecture, and it enables jointly training from image and video data, which we find to reduce the variance of minibatch gradients and speed up optimization. To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a new conditional sampling technique for spatial and temporal video extension that performs better than previously proposed methods. We present the first results on a large text-conditioned video generation task, as well as state-of-the-art results on an established unconditional video generation benchmark.

### 24.Deep Visual Geo-localization Benchmark  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03444.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a new open-source benchmarking framework for Visual Geo-localization (VG) that allows to build, train, and test a wide range of commonly used architectures, with the flexibility to change individual components of a geo-localization pipeline. The purpose of this framework is twofold: i) gaining insights into how different components and design choices in a VG pipeline impact the final results, both in terms of performance (recall@N metric) and system requirements (such as execution time and memory consumption); ii) establish a systematic evaluation protocol for comparing different methods. Using the proposed framework, we perform a large suite of experiments which provide criteria for choosing backbone, aggregation and negative mining depending on the use-case and requirements. We also assess the impact of engineering techniques like pre/post-processing, data augmentation and image resizing, showing that better performance can be obtained through somewhat simple procedures: for example, downscaling the images' resolution to 80% can lead to similar results with a 36% savings in extraction time and dataset storage requirement.

### 25.Task-Aware Active Learning for Endoscopic Image Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03440.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation of polyps and depth estimation are two important research problems in endoscopic image analysis. One of the main obstacles to conduct research on these research problems is lack of annotated data. Endoscopic annotations necessitate the specialist knowledge of expert endoscopists and due to this, it can be difficult to organise, expensive and time consuming. To address this problem, we investigate an active learning paradigm to reduce the number of training examples by selecting the most discriminative and diverse unlabelled examples for the task taken into consideration. Most of the existing active learning pipelines are task-agnostic in nature and are often sub-optimal to the end task. In this paper, we propose a novel task-aware active learning pipeline and applied for two important tasks in endoscopic image analysis: semantic segmentation and depth estimation. We compared our method with the competitive baselines. From the experimental results, we observe a substantial improvement over the compared baselines.

### 26.Incremental Prototype Prompt-tuning with Pre-trained Representation for Class Incremental Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03410.pdf)
>  Class incremental learning has attracted much attention, but most existing works still continually fine-tune the representation model, resulting in much catastrophic forgetting. Instead of struggling to fight against such forgetting by replaying or distillation like most of the existing methods, we take the pre-train-and-prompt-tuning paradigm to sequentially learn new visual concepts based on a fixed semantic rich pre-trained representation model by incremental prototype prompt-tuning (IPP), which substantially reduces the catastrophic forgetting. In addition, an example prototype classification is proposed to compensate for semantic drift, the problem caused by learning bias at different phases. Extensive experiments conducted on the three incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with a large margin.      
### 27.HunYuan_tvr for Text-Video Retrivial  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03382.pdf)
>  Text-Video Retrieval plays an important role in multi-modal understanding and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most existing methods focus on constructing contrastive pairs between whole videos and complete caption sentences, while ignoring fine-grained cross-modal relationships, e.g., short clips and phrases or single frame and word. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named HunYuan\_tvr, to explore hierarchical cross-modal interactions by simultaneously exploring video-sentence, clip-phrase, and frame-word relationships. Considering intrinsic semantic relations between frames, HunYuan\_tvr first performs self-attention to explore frame-wise correlations and adaptively clusters correlated frames into clip-level representations. Then, the clip-wise correlation is explored to aggregate clip representations into a compact one to describe the video globally. In this way, we can construct hierarchical video representations for frame-clip-video granularities, and also explore word-wise correlations to form word-phrase-sentence embeddings for the text modality. Finally, hierarchical contrastive learning is designed to explore cross-modal relationships,~\emph{i.e.,} frame-word, clip-phrase, and video-sentence, which enables HunYuan\_tvr to achieve a comprehensive multi-modal understanding. Further boosted by adaptive label denosing and marginal sample enhancement, HunYuan\_tvr obtains new state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, e.g., Rank@1 of 55.0%, 57.8%, 29.7%, 52.1%, and 57.3% on MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and ActivityNet respectively.      
### 28.Detection of Distracted Driver using Convolution Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03371.pdf)
>  With over 50 million car sales annually and over 1.3 million deaths every year due to motor accidents we have chosen this space. India accounts for 11 per cent of global death in road accidents. Drivers are held responsible for 78% of accidents. Road safety problems in developing countries is a major concern and human behavior is ascribed as one of the main causes and accelerators of road safety problems. Driver distraction has been identified as the main reason for accidents. Distractions can be caused due to reasons such as mobile usage, drinking, operating instruments, facial makeup, social interaction. For the scope of this project, we will focus on building a highly efficient ML model to classify different driver distractions at runtime using computer vision. We would also analyze the overall speed and scalability of the model in order to be able to set it up on an edge device. We use CNN, VGG-16, RestNet50 and ensemble of CNN to predict the classes.      
### 29.ECCV Caption: Correcting False Negatives by Collecting Machine-and-Human-verified Image-Caption Associations for MS-COCO  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03359.pdf)
>  Image-Test matching (ITM) is a common task for evaluating the quality of Vision and Language (VL) models. However, existing ITM benchmarks have a significant limitation. They have many missing correspondences, originating from the data construction process itself. For example, a caption is only matched with one image although the caption can be matched with other similar images, and vice versa. To correct the massive false negatives, we construct the Extended COCO Validation (ECCV) Caption dataset by supplying the missing associations with machine and human annotators. We employ five state-of-the-art ITM models with diverse properties for our annotation process. Our dataset provides x3.6 positive image-to-caption associations and x8.5 caption-to-image associations compared to the original MS-COCO. We also propose to use an informative ranking-based metric, rather than the popular Recall@K(R@K). We re-evaluate the existing 25 VL models on existing and proposed benchmarks. Our findings are that the existing benchmarks, such as COCO 1K R@K, COCO 5K R@K, CxC R@1 are highly correlated with each other, while the rankings change when we shift to the ECCV mAP. Lastly, we delve into the effect of the bias introduced by the choice of machine annotator.

### 30.Event Transformer. A sparse-aware solution for efficient event data processing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03355.pdf)
>  Event cameras are sensors of great interest for many applications that run in low-resource and challenging environments. They log sparse illumination changes with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, while they present minimal power consumption. However, top-performing methods often ignore specific event-data properties, leading to the development of generic but computationally expensive algorithms. Efforts toward efficient solutions usually do not achieve top-accuracy results for complex tasks. This work proposes a novel framework, Event Transformer (EvT), that effectively takes advantage of event-data properties to be highly efficient and accurate. We introduce a new patch-based event representation and a compact transformer-like architecture to process it. EvT is evaluated on different event-based benchmarks for action and gesture recognition. Evaluation results show better or comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art while requiring significantly less computation resources, which makes EvT able to work with minimal latency both on GPU and CPU.      
### 31.Learning Online Multi-Sensor Depth Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03353.pdf)
>  Many hand-held or mixed reality devices are used with a single sensor for 3D reconstruction, although they often comprise multiple sensors. Multi-sensor depth fusion is able to substantially improve the robustness and accuracy of 3D reconstruction methods, but existing techniques are not robust enough to handle sensors which operate with diverse value ranges as well as noise and outlier statistics. To this end, we introduce SenFuNet, a depth fusion approach that learns sensor-specific noise and outlier statistics and combines the data streams of depth frames from different sensors in an online fashion. Our method fuses multi-sensor depth streams regardless of time synchronization and calibration and generalizes well with little training data. We conduct experiments with various sensor combinations on the real-world CoRBS and Scene3D datasets, as well as the Replica dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our fusion strategy outperforms traditional and recent online depth fusion approaches. In addition, the combination of multiple sensors yields more robust outlier handling and precise surface reconstruction than the use of a single sensor.      
### 32.Implementing a Real-Time, YOLOv5 based Social Distancing Measuring System for Covid-19  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03350.pdf)
>  The purpose of this work is, to provide a YOLOv5 deep learning-based social distance monitoring framework using an overhead view perspective. In addition, we have developed a custom defined model YOLOv5 modified CSP (Cross Stage Partial Network) and assessed the performance on COCO and Visdrone dataset with and without transfer learning. Our findings show that the developed model successfully identifies the individual who violates the social distances. The accuracy of 81.7% for the modified bottleneck CSP without transfer learning is observed on COCO dataset after training the model for 300 epochs whereas for the same epochs, the default YOLOv5 model is attaining 80.1% accuracy with transfer learning. This shows an improvement in accuracy by our modified bottleneck CSP model. For the Visdrone dataset, we are able to achieve an accuracy of upto 56.5% for certain classes and especially an accuracy of 40% for people and pedestrians with transfer learning using the default YOLOv5s model for 30 epochs. While the modified bottleneck CSP is able to perform slightly better than the default model with an accuracy score of upto 58.1% for certain classes and an accuracy of ~40.4% for people and pedestrians.      
### 33.PSTR: End-to-End One-Step Person Search With Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03340.pdf)
>  We propose a novel one-step transformer-based person search framework, PSTR, that jointly performs person detection and re-identification (re-id) in a single architecture. PSTR comprises a person search-specialized (PSS) module that contains a detection encoder-decoder for person detection along with a discriminative re-id decoder for person re-id. The discriminative re-id decoder utilizes a multi-level supervision scheme with a shared decoder for discriminative re-id feature learning and also comprises a part attention block to encode relationship between different parts of a person. We further introduce a simple multi-scale scheme to support re-id across person instances at different scales. PSTR jointly achieves the diverse objectives of object-level recognition (detection) and instance-level matching (re-id). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an end-to-end one-step transformer-based person search framework. Experiments are performed on two popular benchmarks: CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Our extensive ablations reveal the merits of the proposed contributions. Further, the proposed PSTR sets a new state-of-the-art on both benchmarks. On the challenging PRW benchmark, PSTR achieves a mean average precision (mAP) score of 56.5%.

### 34.Learning to Sieve: Prediction of Grading Curves from Images of Concrete Aggregate  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03333.pdf)
>  A large component of the building material concrete consists of aggregate with varying particle sizes between 0.125 and 32 mm. Its actual size distribution significantly affects the quality characteristics of the final concrete in both, the fresh and hardened states. The usually unknown variations in the size distribution of the aggregate particles, which can be large especially when using recycled aggregate materials, are typically compensated by an increased usage of cement which, however, has severe negative impacts on economical and ecological aspects of the concrete production. In order to allow a precise control of the target properties of the concrete, unknown variations in the size distribution have to be quantified to enable a proper adaptation of the concrete's mixture design in real time. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning based method for the determination of concrete aggregate grading curves. In this context, we propose a network architecture applying multi-scale feature extraction modules in order to handle the strongly diverse object sizes of the particles. Furthermore, we propose and publish a novel dataset of concrete aggregate used for the quantitative evaluation of our method.      
### 35.Sparse Optical Flow-Based Line Feature Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03331.pdf)
>  In this paper we propose a novel sparse optical flow (SOF)-based line feature tracking method for the camera pose estimation problem. This method is inspired by the point-based SOF algorithm and developed based on an observation that two adjacent images in time-varying image sequences satisfy brightness invariant. Based on this observation, we re-define the goal of line feature tracking: track two endpoints of a line feature instead of the entire line based on gray value matching instead of descriptor matching. To achieve this goal, an efficient two endpoint tracking (TET) method is presented: first, describe a given line feature with its two endpoints; next, track the two endpoints based on SOF to obtain two new tracked endpoints by minimizing a pixel-level grayscale residual function; finally, connect the two tracked endpoints to generate a new line feature. The correspondence is established between the given and the new line feature. Compared with current descriptor-based methods, our TET method needs not to compute descriptors and detect line features repeatedly. Naturally, it has an obvious advantage over computation. Experiments in several public benchmark datasets show our method yields highly competitive accuracy with an obvious advantage over speed.      
### 36.Coarse-to-Fine Feature Mining for Video Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03330.pdf)
>  The contextual information plays a core role in semantic segmentation. As for video semantic segmentation, the contexts include static contexts and motional contexts, corresponding to static content and moving content in a video clip, respectively. The static contexts are well exploited in image semantic segmentation by learning multi-scale and global/long-range features. The motional contexts are studied in previous video semantic segmentation. However, there is no research about how to simultaneously learn static and motional contexts which are highly correlated and complementary to each other. To address this problem, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Feature Mining (CFFM) technique to learn a unified presentation of static contexts and motional contexts. This technique consists of two parts: coarse-to-fine feature assembling and cross-frame feature mining. The former operation prepares data for further processing, enabling the subsequent joint learning of static and motional contexts. The latter operation mines useful information/contexts from the sequential frames to enhance the video contexts of the features of the target frame. The enhanced features can be directly applied for the final prediction. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CFFM performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods for video semantic segmentation.

### 37.A Comprehensive Review of Sign Language Recognition: Different Types, Modalities, and Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03328.pdf)
>  A machine can understand human activities, and the meaning of signs can help overcome the communication barriers between the inaudible and ordinary people. Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a fascinating research area and a crucial task concerning computer vision and pattern recognition. Recently, SLR usage has increased in many applications, but the environment, background image resolution, modalities, and datasets affect the performance a lot. Many researchers have been striving to carry out generic real-time SLR models. This review paper facilitates a comprehensive overview of SLR and discusses the needs, challenges, and problems associated with SLR. We study related works about manual and non-manual, various modalities, and datasets. Research progress and existing state-of-the-art SLR models over the past decade have been reviewed. Finally, we find the research gap and limitations in this domain and suggest future directions. This review paper will be helpful for readers and researchers to get complete guidance about SLR and the progressive design of the state-of-the-art SLR model      
### 38.Swarm behavior tracking based on a deep vision algorithm  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03319.pdf)
>  The intelligent swarm behavior of social insects (such as ants) springs up in different environments, promising to provide insights for the study of embodied intelligence. Researching swarm behavior requires that researchers could accurately track each individual over time. Obviously, manually labeling individual insects in a video is labor-intensive. Automatic tracking methods, however, also poses serious challenges: (1) individuals are small and similar in appearance; (2) frequent interactions with each other cause severe and long-term occlusion. With the advances of artificial intelligence and computing vision technologies, we are hopeful to provide a tool to automate monitor multiple insects to address the above challenges. In this paper, we propose a detection and tracking framework for multi-ant tracking in the videos by: (1) adopting a two-stage object detection framework using ResNet-50 as backbone and coding the position of regions of interest to locate ants accurately; (2) using the ResNet model to develop the appearance descriptors of ants; (3) constructing long-term appearance sequences and combining them with motion information to achieve online tracking. To validate our method, we construct an ant database including 10 videos of ants from different indoor and outdoor scenes. We achieve a state-of-the-art performance of 95.7\% mMOTA and 81.1\% mMOTP in indoor videos, 81.8\% mMOTA and 81.9\% mMOTP in outdoor videos. Additionally, Our method runs 6-10 times faster than existing methods for insect tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides a powerful tool for accelerating the unraveling of the mechanisms underlying the swarm behavior of social insects.      
### 39.Deep Learning for Real Time Satellite Pose Estimation on Low Power Edge TPU  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03296.pdf)
>  Pose estimation of an uncooperative space resident object is a key asset towards autonomy in close proximity operations. In this context monocular cameras are a valuable solution because of their low system requirements. However, the associated image processing algorithms are either too computationally expensive for real time on-board implementation, or not enough accurate. In this paper we propose a pose estimation software exploiting neural network architectures which can be scaled to different accuracy-latency trade-offs. We designed our pipeline to be compatible with Edge Tensor Processing Units to show how low power machine learning accelerators could enable Artificial Intelligence exploitation in space. The neural networks were tested both on the benchmark Spacecraft Pose Estimation Dataset, and on the purposely developed Cosmo Photorealistic Dataset, which depicts a COSMO-SkyMed satellite in a variety of random poses and steerable solar panels orientations. The lightest version of our architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both datasets but at a fraction of networks complexity, running at 7.7 frames per second on a Coral Dev Board Mini consuming just 2.2W.      
### 40.Context-Sensitive Temporal Feature Learning for Gait Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03270.pdf)
>  Although gait recognition has drawn increasing research attention recently, it remains challenging to learn discriminative temporal representation, since the silhouette differences are quite subtle in spatial domain. Inspired by the observation that human can distinguish gaits of different subjects by adaptively focusing on temporal clips with different time scales, we propose a context-sensitive temporal feature learning (CSTL) network for gait recognition. CSTL produces temporal features in three scales, and adaptively aggregates them according to the contextual information from local and global perspectives. Specifically, CSTL contains an adaptive temporal aggregation module that subsequently performs local relation modeling and global relation modeling to fuse the multi-scale features. Besides, in order to remedy the spatial feature corruption caused by temporal operations, CSTL incorporates a salient spatial feature learning (SSFL) module to select groups of discriminative spatial features. Particularly, we utilize transformers to implement the global relation modeling and the SSFL module. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that adopts transformer in gait recognition. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance. Concretely, we achieve rank-1 accuracies of 98.7%, 96.2% and 88.7% under normal-walking, bag-carrying and coat-wearing conditions on CASIA-B, 97.5% on OU-MVLP and 50.6% on GREW.      
### 41.Pan-cancer computational histopathology reveals tumor mutational burden status through weakly-supervised deep learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03257.pdf)
>  Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a potential genomic biomarker that can help identify patients who will benefit from immunotherapy across a variety of cancers. We included whole slide images (WSIs) of 3228 diagnostic slides from the Cancer Genome Atlas and 531 WSIs from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium for the development and verification of a pan-cancer TMB prediction model (PC-TMB). We proposed a multiscale weakly-supervised deep learning framework for predicting TMB of seven types of tumors based only on routinely used hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E)-stained WSIs. PC-TMB achieved a mean area under curve (AUC) of 0.818 (0.804-0.831) in the cross-validation cohort, which was superior to the best single-scale model. In comparison with the state-of-the-art TMB prediction model from previous publications, our multiscale model achieved better performance over previously reported models. In addition, the improvements of PC-TMB over the single-tumor models were also confirmed by the ablation tests on 10x magnification. The PC-TMB algorithm also exhibited good generalization on external validation cohort with AUC of 0.732 (0.683-0.761). PC-TMB possessed a comparable survival-risk stratification performance to the TMB measured by whole exome sequencing, but with low cost and being time-efficient for providing a prognostic biomarker of multiple solid tumors. Moreover, spatial heterogeneity of TMB within tumors was also identified through our PC-TMB, which might enable image-based screening for molecular biomarkers with spatial variation and potential exploring for genotype-spatial heterogeneity relationships.      
### 42.HIT-UAV: A High-altitude Infrared Thermal Dataset for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03245.pdf)
>  This paper presents a High-altitude infrared thermal dataset, HIT-UAV, for object detection applications on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). HIT-UAV contains 2898 infrared thermal images extracted from 43470 frames. These images are collected by UAV from schools, parking lots, roads, playgrounds, etc. HIT-UAV provides different flight data for each place, including flight altitude (from 60 to 130 meters), camera perspective (from 30 to 90 degrees), date, and daylight intensity. For each image, the HIT-UAV manual annotates object instances with two types of the bounding box (oriented and standard) to address the challenge that object instances have a significant overlap in aerial images. To the best of our knowledge, HIT-UAV is the first publicly available high-altitude infrared thermal UAV dataset for persons and vehicles detection. Moreover, we trained and evaluated the benchmark detection algorithms (YOLOv4 and YOLOv4-tiny) on HIT-UAV. Compared to the visual light dataset, the detection algorithms have excellent performance on HIT-UAV because the infrared thermal images do not contain a significant quantity of irrelevant information with detection objects. This indicates that infrared thermal datasets can significantly promote the development of object detection applications. We hope HIT-UAV contributes to UAV applications such as traffic surveillance and city monitoring at night.

### 43.L2G: A Simple Local-to-Global Knowledge Transfer Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03206.pdf)
>  Mining precise class-aware attention maps, a.k.a, class activation maps, is essential for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. In this paper, we present L2G, a simple online local-to-global knowledge transfer framework for high-quality object attention mining. We observe that classification models can discover object regions with more details when replacing the input image with its local patches. Taking this into account, we first leverage a local classification network to extract attentions from multiple local patches randomly cropped from the input image. Then, we utilize a global network to learn complementary attention knowledge across multiple local attention maps online. Our framework conducts the global network to learn the captured rich object detail knowledge from a global view and thereby produces high-quality attention maps that can be directly used as pseudo annotations for semantic segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method attains 72.1% and 44.2% mIoU scores on the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014, respectively, setting new state-of-the-art records.

### 44.Winoground: Probing Vision and Language Models for Visio-Linguistic Compositionality  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03162.pdf)
>  We present a novel task and dataset for evaluating the ability of vision and language models to conduct visio-linguistic compositional reasoning, which we call Winoground. Given two images and two captions, the goal is to match them correctly - but crucially, both captions contain a completely identical set of words, only in a different order. The dataset was carefully hand-curated by expert annotators and is labeled with a rich set of fine-grained tags to assist in analyzing model performance. We probe a diverse range of state-of-the-art vision and language models and find that, surprisingly, none of them do much better than chance. Evidently, these models are not as skilled at visio-linguistic compositional reasoning as we might have hoped. We perform an extensive analysis to obtain insights into how future work might try to mitigate these models' shortcomings. We aim for Winoground to serve as a useful evaluation set for advancing the state of the art and driving further progress in the field.

### 45.Flexible Sampling for Long-tailed Skin Lesion Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03161.pdf)
>  Most of the medical tasks naturally exhibit a long-tailed distribution due to the complex patient-level conditions and the existence of rare diseases. Existing long-tailed learning methods usually treat each class equally to re-balance the long-tailed distribution. However, considering that some challenging classes may present diverse intra-class distributions, re-balancing all classes equally may lead to a significant performance drop. To address this, in this paper, we propose a curriculum learning-based framework called Flexible Sampling for the long-tailed skin lesion classification task. Specifically, we initially sample a subset of training data as anchor points based on the individual class prototypes. Then, these anchor points are used to pre-train an inference model to evaluate the per-class learning difficulty. Finally, we use a curriculum sampling module to dynamically query new samples from the rest training samples with the learning difficulty-aware sampling probability. We evaluated our model against several state-of-the-art methods on the ISIC dataset. The results with two long-tailed settings have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed training strategy, which achieves a new benchmark for long-tailed skin lesion classification.      
### 46.Just-Noticeable-Difference Based Edge Map Quality Measure  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03155.pdf)
>  The performance of an edge detector can be improved when assisted with an effective edge map quality measure. Several evaluation methods have been proposed resulting in different performance score for the same candidate edge map. However, an effective measure is the one that can be automated and which correlates with human judgement perceived quality of the edge map. Distance-based edge map measures are widely used for assessment of edge map quality. These methods consider distance and statistical properties of edge pixels to estimate a performance score. The existing methods can be automated; however, they lack perceptual features. This paper presents edge map quality measure based on Just-Noticeable-Difference (JND) feature of human visual system, to compensate the shortcomings of distance-based edge measures. For this purpose, we have designed constant stimulus experiment to measure the JND value for two spatial alternative. Experimental results show that JND based distance calculation outperforms existing distance-based measures according to subjective evaluation.      
### 47.Exploring Cross-Domain Pretrained Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03144.pdf)
>  A pretrain-finetune strategy is widely used to reduce the overfitting that can occur when data is insufficient for CNN training. First few layers of a CNN pretrained on a large-scale RGB dataset are capable of acquiring general image characteristics which are remarkably effective in tasks targeted for different RGB datasets. However, when it comes down to hyperspectral domain where each domain has its unique spectral properties, the pretrain-finetune strategy no longer can be deployed in a conventional way while presenting three major issues: 1) inconsistent spectral characteristics among the domains (e.g., frequency range), 2) inconsistent number of data channels among the domains, and 3) absence of large-scale hyperspectral dataset. <br>We seek to train a universal cross-domain model which can later be deployed for various spectral domains. To achieve, we physically furnish multiple inlets to the model while having a universal portion which is designed to handle the inconsistent spectral characteristics among different domains. Note that only the universal portion is used in the finetune process. This approach naturally enables the learning of our model on multiple domains simultaneously which acts as an effective workaround for the issue of the absence of large-scale dataset. <br>We have carried out a study to extensively compare models that were trained using cross-domain approach with ones trained from scratch. Our approach was found to be superior both in accuracy and in training efficiency. In addition, we have verified that our approach effectively reduces the overfitting issue, enabling us to deepen the model up to 13 layers (from 9) without compromising the accuracy.      
### 48.Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks Against Video Anomaly Detection Systems  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03141.pdf)
>  Anomaly detection in videos is an important computer vision problem with various applications including automated video surveillance. Although adversarial attacks on image understanding models have been heavily investigated, there is not much work on adversarial machine learning targeting video understanding models and no previous work which focuses on video anomaly detection. To this end, we investigate an adversarial machine learning attack against video anomaly detection systems, that can be implemented via an easy-to-perform cyber-attack. Since surveillance cameras are usually connected to the server running the anomaly detection model through a wireless network, they are prone to cyber-attacks targeting the wireless connection. We demonstrate how Wi-Fi deauthentication attack, a notoriously easy-to-perform and effective denial-of-service (DoS) attack, can be utilized to generate adversarial data for video anomaly detection systems. Specifically, we apply several effects caused by the Wi-Fi deauthentication attack on video quality (e.g., slow down, freeze, fast forward, low resolution) to the popular benchmark datasets for video anomaly detection. Our experiments with several state-of-the-art anomaly detection models show that the attackers can significantly undermine the reliability of video anomaly detection systems by causing frequent false alarms and hiding physical anomalies from the surveillance system.      
### 49.AutoCOR: Autonomous Condylar Offset Ratio Calculator on TKA-Postoperative Lateral Knee X-ray  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03120.pdf)
>  The postoperative range of motion is one of the crucial factors indicating the outcome of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). Although the correlation between range of knee flexion and posterior condylar offset (PCO) is controversial in the literature, PCO maintains its importance on evaluation of TKA. Due to limitations on PCO measurement, two novel parameters, posterior condylar offset ratio (PCOR) and anterior condylar offset ratio (ACOR), were introduced. Nowadays, the calculation of PCOR and ACOR on plain lateral radiographs is done manually by orthopedic surgeons. In this regard, we developed a software, AutoCOR, to calculate PCOR and ACOR autonomously, utilizing unsupervised machine learning algorithm (k-means clustering) and digital image processing techniques. The software AutoCOR is capable of detecting the anterior/posterior edge points and anterior/posterior cortex of the femoral shaft on true postoperative lateral conventional radiographs. To test the algorithm, 50 postoperative true lateral radiographs from Istanbul Kosuyolu Medipol Hospital Database were used (32 patients). The mean PCOR was 0.984 (SD 0.235) in software results and 0.972 (SD 0.164) in ground truth values. It shows strong and significant correlation between software and ground truth values (Pearson r=0.845 p&lt;0.0001). The mean ACOR was 0.107 (SD 0.092) in software results and 0.107 (SD 0.070) in ground truth values. It shows moderate and significant correlation between software and ground truth values (Spearman's rs=0.519 p=0.0001412). We suggest that AutoCOR is a useful tool that can be used in clinical practice.      
### 50.UIGR: Unified Interactive Garment Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03111.pdf)
>  Interactive garment retrieval (IGR) aims to retrieve a target garment image based on a reference garment image along with user feedback on what to change on the reference garment. Two IGR tasks have been studied extensively: text-guided garment retrieval (TGR) and visually compatible garment retrieval (VCR). The user feedback for the former indicates what semantic attributes to change with the garment category preserved, while the category is the only thing to be changed explicitly for the latter, with an implicit requirement on style preservation. Despite the similarity between these two tasks and the practical need for an efficient system tackling both, they have never been unified and modeled jointly. In this paper, we propose a Unified Interactive Garment Retrieval (UIGR) framework to unify TGR and VCR. To this end, we first contribute a large-scale benchmark suited for both problems. We further propose a strong baseline architecture to integrate TGR and VCR in one model. Extensive experiments suggest that unifying two tasks in one framework is not only more efficient by requiring a single model only, it also leads to better performance.

### 51.AUV-Net: Learning Aligned UV Maps for Texture Transfer and Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03105.pdf)
>  In this paper, we address the problem of texture representation for 3D shapes for the challenging and underexplored tasks of texture transfer and synthesis. Previous works either apply spherical texture maps which may lead to large distortions, or use continuous texture fields that yield smooth outputs lacking details. We argue that the traditional way of representing textures with images and linking them to a 3D mesh via UV mapping is more desirable, since synthesizing 2D images is a well-studied problem. We propose AUV-Net which learns to embed 3D surfaces into a 2D aligned UV space, by mapping the corresponding semantic parts of different 3D shapes to the same location in the UV space. As a result, textures are aligned across objects, and can thus be easily synthesized by generative models of images. Texture alignment is learned in an unsupervised manner by a simple yet effective texture alignment module, taking inspiration from traditional works on linear subspace learning. The learned UV mapping and aligned texture representations enable a variety of applications including texture transfer, texture synthesis, and textured single view 3D reconstruction. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

### 52.Hierarchical Self-supervised Representation Learning for Movie Understanding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03101.pdf)
>  Most self-supervised video representation learning approaches focus on action recognition. In contrast, in this paper we focus on self-supervised video learning for movie understanding and propose a novel hierarchical self-supervised pretraining strategy that separately pretrains each level of our hierarchical movie understanding model (based on [37]). Specifically, we propose to pretrain the low-level video backbone using a contrastive learning objective, while pretrain the higher-level video contextualizer using an event mask prediction task, which enables the usage of different data sources for pretraining different levels of the hierarchy. We first show that our self-supervised pretraining strategies are effective and lead to improved performance on all tasks and metrics on VidSitu benchmark [37] (e.g., improving on semantic role prediction from 47% to 61% CIDEr scores). We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our contextualized event features on LVU tasks [54], both when used alone and when combined with instance features, showing their complementarity.      
### 53.Audio-Visual Person-of-Interest DeepFake Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03083.pdf)
>  Face manipulation technology is advancing very rapidly, and new methods are being proposed day by day. The aim of this work is to propose a deepfake detector that can cope with the wide variety of manipulation methods and scenarios encountered in the real world. Our key insight is that each person has specific biometric characteristics that a synthetic generator cannot likely reproduce. Accordingly, we extract high-level audio-visual biometric features which characterize the identity of a person, and use them to create a person-of-interest (POI) deepfake detector. We leverage a contrastive learning paradigm to learn the moving-face and audio segments embeddings that are most discriminative for each identity. As a result, when the video and/or audio of a person is manipulated, its representation in the embedding space becomes inconsistent with the real identity, allowing reliable detection. Training is carried out exclusively on real talking-face videos, thus the detector does not depend on any specific manipulation method and yields the highest generalization ability. In addition, our method can detect both single-modality (audio-only, video-only) and multi-modality (audio-video) attacks, and is robust to low-quality or corrupted videos by building only on high-level semantic features. Experiments on a wide variety of datasets confirm that our method ensures a SOTA performance, with an average improvement in terms of AUC of around 3%, 10%, and 7% for high-quality, low quality and attacked videos, respectively.      
### 54.Instance Segmentation of Unlabeled Modalities via Cyclic Segmentation GAN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03082.pdf)
>  Instance segmentation for unlabeled imaging modalities is a challenging but essential task as collecting expert annotation can be expensive and time-consuming. Existing works segment a new modality by either deploying a pre-trained model optimized on diverse training data or conducting domain translation and image segmentation as two independent steps. In this work, we propose a novel Cyclic Segmentation Generative Adversarial Network (CySGAN) that conducts image translation and instance segmentation jointly using a unified framework. Besides the CycleGAN losses for image translation and supervised losses for the annotated source domain, we introduce additional self-supervised and segmentation-based adversarial objectives to improve the model performance by leveraging unlabeled target domain images. We benchmark our approach on the task of 3D neuronal nuclei segmentation with annotated electron microscopy (EM) images and unlabeled expansion microscopy (ExM) data. Our CySGAN outperforms both pretrained generalist models and the baselines that sequentially conduct image translation and segmentation. Our implementation and the newly collected, densely annotated ExM nuclei dataset, named NucExM, are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://connectomics-bazaar.github.io/proj/CySGAN/index.html" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 55.OSCARS: An Outlier-Sensitive Content-Based Radiography Retrieval System  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03074.pdf)
>  Improving the retrieval relevance on noisy datasets is an emerging need for the curation of a large-scale clean dataset in the medical domain. While existing methods can be applied for class-wise retrieval (aka. inter-class), they cannot distinguish the granularity of likeness within the same class (aka. intra-class). The problem is exacerbated on medical external datasets, where noisy samples of the same class are treated equally during training. Our goal is to identify both intra/inter-class similarities for fine-grained retrieval. To achieve this, we propose an Outlier-Sensitive Content-based rAdiologhy Retrieval System (OSCARS), consisting of two steps. First, we train an outlier detector on a clean internal dataset in an unsupervised manner. Then we use the trained detector to generate the anomaly scores on the external dataset, whose distribution will be used to bin intra-class variations. Second, we propose a quadruplet (a, p, nintra, ninter) sampling strategy, where intra-class negatives nintra are sampled from bins of the same class other than the bin anchor a belongs to, while niner are randomly sampled from inter-classes. We suggest a weighted metric learning objective to balance the intra and inter-class feature learning. We experimented on two representative public radiography datasets. Experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.

### 56.The Self-Optimal-Transport Feature Transform  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03065.pdf)
>  The Self-Optimal-Transport (SOT) feature transform is designed to upgrade the set of features of a data instance to facilitate downstream matching or grouping related tasks. The transformed set encodes a rich representation of high order relations between the instance features. Distances between transformed features capture their direct original similarity and their third party agreement regarding similarity to other features in the set. A particular min-cost-max-flow fractional matching problem, whose entropy regularized version can be approximated by an optimal transport (OT) optimization, results in our transductive transform which is efficient, differentiable, equivariant, parameterless and probabilistically interpretable. Empirically, the transform is highly effective and flexible in its use, consistently improving networks it is inserted into, in a variety of tasks and training schemes. We demonstrate its merits through the problem of unsupervised clustering and its efficiency and wide applicability for few-shot-classification, with state-of-the-art results, and large-scale person re-identification.      
### 57.Thermal to Visible Image Synthesis under Atmospheric Turbulence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03057.pdf)
>  In many practical applications of long-range imaging such as biometrics and surveillance, thermal imagining modalities are often used to capture images in low-light and nighttime conditions. However, such imaging systems often suffer from atmospheric turbulence, which introduces severe blur and deformation artifacts to the captured images. Such an issue is unavoidable in long-range imaging and significantly decreases the face verification accuracy. In this paper, we first investigate the problem with a turbulence simulation method on real-world thermal images. An end-to-end reconstruction method is then proposed which can directly transform thermal images into visible-spectrum images by utilizing natural image priors based on a pre-trained StyleGAN2 network. Compared with the existing two-steps methods of consecutive turbulence mitigation and thermal to visible image translation, our method is demonstrated to be effective in terms of both the visual quality of the reconstructed results and face verification accuracy. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the problem of thermal to visible image translation under atmospheric turbulence.      
### 58.DSGN++: Exploiting Visual-Spatial Relation forStereo-based 3D Detectors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03039.pdf)
>  Camera-based 3D object detectors are welcome due to their wider deployment and lower price than LiDAR sensors. We revisit the prior stereo modeling DSGN about the stereo volume constructions for representing both 3D geometry and semantics. We polish the stereo modeling and propose our approach, DSGN++, aiming for improving information flow throughout the 2D-to-3D pipeline in the following three main aspects. First, to effectively lift the 2D information to stereo volume, we propose depth-wise plane sweeping (DPS) that allows denser connections and extracts depth-guided features. Second, for better grasping differently spaced features, we present a novel stereo volume -- Dual-view Stereo Volume (DSV) that integrates front-view and top-view features and reconstructs sub-voxel depth in the camera frustum. Third, as the foreground region becomes less dominant in 3D space, we firstly propose a multi-modal data editing strategy -- Stereo-LiDAR Copy-Paste, which ensures cross-modal alignment and improves data efficiency. Without bells and whistles, extensive experiments in various modality setups on the popular KITTI benchmark show that our method consistently outperforms other camera-based 3D detectors for all categories. Code will be released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/chenyilun95/DSGN2" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 59.Learning from Untrimmed Videos: Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning with Hierarchical Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03017.pdf)
>  Natural videos provide rich visual contents for self-supervised learning. Yet most existing approaches for learning spatio-temporal representations rely on manually trimmed videos, leading to limited diversity in visual patterns and limited performance gain. In this work, we aim to learn representations by leveraging more abundant information in untrimmed videos. To this end, we propose to learn a hierarchy of consistencies in videos, i.e., visual consistency and topical consistency, corresponding respectively to clip pairs that tend to be visually similar when separated by a short time span and share similar topics when separated by a long time span. Specifically, a hierarchical consistency learning framework HiCo is presented, where the visually consistent pairs are encouraged to have the same representation through contrastive learning, while the topically consistent pairs are coupled through a topical classifier that distinguishes whether they are topic related. Further, we impose a gradual sampling algorithm for proposed hierarchical consistency learning, and demonstrate its theoretical superiority. Empirically, we show that not only HiCo can generate stronger representations on untrimmed videos, it also improves the representation quality when applied to trimmed videos. This is in contrast to standard contrastive learning that fails to learn appropriate representations from untrimmed videos.      
### 60.Analysis of Different Losses for Deep Learning Image Colorization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02980.pdf)
>  Image colorization aims to add color information to a grayscale image in a realistic way. Recent methods mostly rely on deep learning strategies. While learning to automatically colorize an image, one can define well-suited objective functions related to the desired color output. Some of them are based on a specific type of error between the predicted image and ground truth one, while other losses rely on the comparison of perceptual properties. But, is the choice of the objective function that crucial, i.e., does it play an important role in the results? In this chapter, we aim to answer this question by analyzing the impact of the loss function on the estimated colorization results. To that goal, we review the different losses and evaluation metrics that are used in the literature. We then train a baseline network with several of the reviewed objective functions: classic L1 and L2 losses, as well as more complex combinations such as Wasserstein GAN and VGG-based LPIPS loss. Quantitative results show that the models trained with VGG-based LPIPS provide overall slightly better results for most evaluation metrics. Qualitative results exhibit more vivid colors when with Wasserstein GAN plus the L2 loss or again with the VGG-based LPIPS. Finally, the convenience of quantitative user studies is also discussed to overcome the difficulty of properly assessing on colorized images, notably for the case of old archive photographs where no ground truth is available.      
### 61.Equivariance Discovery by Learned Parameter-Sharing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03640.pdf)
>  Designing equivariance as an inductive bias into deep-nets has been a prominent approach to build effective models, e.g., a convolutional neural network incorporates translation equivariance. However, incorporating these inductive biases requires knowledge about the equivariance properties of the data, which may not be available, e.g., when encountering a new domain. To address this, we study how to discover interpretable equivariances from data. Specifically, we formulate this discovery process as an optimization problem over a model's parameter-sharing schemes. We propose to use the partition distance to empirically quantify the accuracy of the recovered equivariance. Also, we theoretically analyze the method for Gaussian data and provide a bound on the mean squared gap between the studied discovery scheme and the oracle scheme. Empirically, we show that the approach recovers known equivariances, such as permutations and shifts, on sum of numbers and spatially-invariant data.      
### 62.The Effects of Regularization and Data Augmentation are Class Dependent  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03632.pdf)
>  Regularization is a fundamental technique to prevent over-fitting and to improve generalization performances by constraining a model's complexity. Current Deep Networks heavily rely on regularizers such as Data-Augmentation (DA) or weight-decay, and employ structural risk minimization, i.e. cross-validation, to select the optimal regularization hyper-parameters. In this study, we demonstrate that techniques such as DA or weight decay produce a model with a reduced complexity that is unfair across classes. The optimal amount of DA or weight decay found from cross-validation leads to disastrous model performances on some classes e.g. on Imagenet with a resnet50, the "barn spider" classification test accuracy falls from $68\%$ to $46\%$ only by introducing random crop DA during training. Even more surprising, such performance drop also appears when introducing uninformative regularization techniques such as weight decay. Those results demonstrate that our search for ever increasing generalization performance -- averaged over all classes and samples -- has left us with models and regularizers that silently sacrifice performances on some classes. This scenario can become dangerous when deploying a model on downstream tasks e.g. an Imagenet pre-trained resnet50 deployed on INaturalist sees its performances fall from $70\%$ to $30\%$ on class \#8889 when introducing random crop DA during the Imagenet pre-training phase. Those results demonstrate that designing novel regularizers without class-dependent bias remains an open research question.      
### 63.Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Rays using Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03618.pdf)
>  With the advancement in AI, deep learning techniques are widely used to design robust classification models in several areas such as medical diagnosis tasks in which it achieves good performance. In this paper, we have proposed the CNN model (Convolutional Neural Network) for the classification of Chest X-ray images for Radiological Society of North America Pneumonia (RSNA) datasets. The study also tries to achieve the same RSNA benchmark results using the limited computational resources by trying out various approaches to the methodologies that have been implemented in recent years. The proposed method is based on a non-complex CNN and the use of transfer learning algorithms like Xception, InceptionV3/V4, EfficientNetB7. Along with this, the study also tries to achieve the same RSNA benchmark results using the limited computational resources by trying out various approaches to the methodologies that have been implemented in recent years. The RSNA benchmark MAP score is 0.25, but using the Mask RCNN model on a stratified sample of 3017 along with image augmentation gave a MAP score of 0.15. Meanwhile, the YoloV3 without any hyperparameter tuning gave the MAP score of 0.32 but still, the loss keeps decreasing. Running the model for a greater number of iterations can give better results.      
### 64.Learning to Compose Soft Prompts for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03574.pdf)
>  We introduce compositional soft prompting (CSP), a parameter-efficient learning technique to improve the zero-shot compositionality of large-scale pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) without the overhead of fine-tuning the entire model. VLMs can represent arbitrary classes as natural language prompts in their flexible text encoders but they underperform state-of-the-art methods on compositional zero-shot benchmark tasks. To improve VLMs, we propose a novel form of soft prompting. We treat the attributes and objects that are composed to define classes as learnable tokens of vocabulary and tune them on multiple prompt compositions. During inference, we recompose the learned attribute-object vocabulary in new combinations and show that CSP outperforms the original VLM on benchmark datasets by an average of 14.7 percentage points of accuracy. CSP also achieves new state-of-the-art accuracies on two out of three benchmark datasets, while only fine-tuning a small number of parameters. Further, we show that CSP improves generalization to higher-order attribute-attribute-object compositions and combinations of pretrained attributes and fine-tuned objects.      
### 65.A Pathology-Based Machine Learning Method to Assist in Epithelial Dysplasia Diagnosis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03572.pdf)
>  The Epithelial Dysplasia (ED) is a tissue alteration commonly present in lesions preceding oral cancer, being its presence one of the most important factors in the progression toward carcinoma. This study proposes a method to design a low computational cost classification system to support the detection of dysplastic epithelia, contributing to reduce the variability of pathologist assessments. We employ a multilayer artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) and defining the regions of the epithelium to be assessed based on the knowledge of the pathologist. The performance of the proposed solution was statistically evaluated. The implemented MLP-ANN presented an average accuracy of 87%, with a variability much inferior to that obtained from three trained evaluators. Moreover, the proposed solution led to results which are very close to those obtained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented by transfer learning, with 100 times less computational complexity. In conclusion, our results show that a simple neural network structure can lead to a performance equivalent to that of much more complex structures, which are routinely used in the literature.      
### 66.Explicit and Implicit Pattern Relation Analysis for Discovering Actionable Negative Sequences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03571.pdf)
>  Real-life events, behaviors and interactions produce sequential data. An important but rarely explored problem is to analyze those nonoccurring (also called negative) yet important sequences, forming negative sequence analysis (NSA). A typical NSA area is to discover negative sequential patterns (NSPs) consisting of important non-occurring and occurring elements and patterns. The limited existing work on NSP mining relies on frequentist and downward closure property-based pattern selection, producing large and highly redundant NSPs, nonactionable for business decision-making. This work makes the first attempt for actionable NSP discovery. It builds an NSP graph representation, quantify both explicit occurrence and implicit non-occurrence-based element and pattern relations, and then discover significant, diverse and informative NSPs in the NSP graph to represent the entire NSP set for discovering actionable NSPs. A DPP-based NSP representation and actionable NSP discovery method EINSP introduces novel and significant contributions for NSA and sequence analysis: (1) it represents NSPs by a determinantal point process (DPP) based graph; (2) it quantifies actionable NSPs in terms of their statistical significance, diversity, and strength of explicit/implicit element/pattern relations; and (3) it models and measures both explicit and implicit element/pattern relations in the DPP-based NSP graph to represent direct and indirect couplings between NSP items, elements and patterns. We substantially analyze the effectiveness of EINSP in terms of various theoretical and empirical aspects including complexity, item/pattern coverage, pattern size and diversity, implicit pattern relation strength, and data factors.      
### 67.Evaluating Procedures for Establishing Generative Adversarial Network-based Stochastic Image Models in Medical Imaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03547.pdf)
>  Modern generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), hold tremendous promise for several areas of medical imaging, such as unconditional medical image synthesis, image restoration, reconstruction and translation, and optimization of imaging systems. However, procedures for establishing stochastic image models (SIMs) using GANs remain generic and do not address specific issues relevant to medical imaging. In this work, canonical SIMs that simulate realistic vessels in angiography images are employed to evaluate procedures for establishing SIMs using GANs. The GAN-based SIM is compared to the canonical SIM based on its ability to reproduce those statistics that are meaningful to the particular medically realistic SIM considered. It is shown that evaluating GANs using classical metrics and medically relevant metrics may lead to different conclusions about the fidelity of the trained GANs. This work highlights the need for the development of objective metrics for evaluating GANs.      
### 68.Visualizing Deep Neural Networks with Topographic Activation Maps  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03528.pdf)
>  Machine Learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has become a successful tool in solving tasks across various fields of application. The success of DNNs is strongly connected to their high complexity in terms of the number of network layers or of neurons in each layer, which severely complicates to understand how DNNs solve their learned task. To improve the explainability of DNNs, we adapt methods from neuroscience because this field has a rich experience in analyzing complex and opaque systems. In this work, we draw inspiration from how neuroscience uses topographic maps to visualize the activity of the brain when it performs certain tasks. Transferring this approach to DNNs can help to visualize and understand their internal processes more intuitively, too. However, the inner structures of brains and DNNs differ substantially. Therefore, to be able to visualize activations of neurons in DNNs as topographic maps, we research techniques to layout the neurons in a two-dimensional space in which neurons of similar activity are in the vicinity of each other. In this work, we introduce and compare different methods to obtain a topographic layout of the neurons in a network layer. Moreover, we demonstrate how to use the resulting topographic activation maps to identify errors or encoded biases in DNNs or data sets. Our novel visualization technique improves the transparency of DNN-based algorithmic decision-making systems and is accessible to a broad audience because topographic maps are intuitive to interpret without expert-knowledge in Machine Learning.      
### 69.Habitat-Web: Learning Embodied Object-Search Strategies from Human Demonstrations at Scale  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03514.pdf)
>  We present a large-scale study of imitating human demonstrations on tasks that require a virtual robot to search for objects in new environments -- (1) ObjectGoal Navigation (e.g. 'find &amp; go to a chair') and (2) Pick&amp;Place (e.g. 'find mug, pick mug, find counter, place mug on counter'). First, we develop a virtual teleoperation data-collection infrastructure -- connecting Habitat simulator running in a web browser to Amazon Mechanical Turk, allowing remote users to teleoperate virtual robots, safely and at scale. We collect 80k demonstrations for ObjectNav and 12k demonstrations for Pick&amp;Place, which is an order of magnitude larger than existing human demonstration datasets in simulation or on real robots. <br>Second, we attempt to answer the question -- how does large-scale imitation learning (IL) (which hasn't been hitherto possible) compare to reinforcement learning (RL) (which is the status quo)? On ObjectNav, we find that IL (with no bells or whistles) using 70k human demonstrations outperforms RL using 240k agent-gathered trajectories. The IL-trained agent demonstrates efficient object-search behavior -- it peeks into rooms, checks corners for small objects, turns in place to get a panoramic view -- none of these are exhibited as prominently by the RL agent, and to induce these behaviors via RL would require tedious reward engineering. Finally, accuracy vs. training data size plots show promising scaling behavior, suggesting that simply collecting more demonstrations is likely to advance the state of art further. On Pick&amp;Place, the comparison is starker -- IL agents achieve ${\sim}$18% success on episodes with new object-receptacle locations when trained with 9.5k human demonstrations, while RL agents fail to get beyond 0%. Overall, our work provides compelling evidence for investing in large-scale imitation learning. <br>Project page: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://ram81.github.io/projects/habitat-web" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 70.Multi-Task Distributed Learning using Vision Transformer with Random Patch Permutation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03500.pdf)
>  The widespread application of artificial intelligence in health research is currently hampered by limitations in data availability. Distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) and shared learning (SL) are introduced to solve this problem as well as data management and ownership issues with their different strengths and weaknesses. The recent proposal of federated split task-agnostic (FeSTA) learning tries to reconcile the distinct merits of FL and SL by enabling the multi-task collaboration between participants through Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, but they suffer from higher communication overhead. To address this, here we present a multi-task distributed learning using ViT with random patch permutation. Instead of using a CNN based head as in FeSTA, p-FeSTA adopts a randomly permuting simple patch embedder, improving the multi-task learning performance without sacrificing privacy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method significantly enhances the benefit of multi-task collaboration, communication efficiency, and privacy preservation, shedding light on practical multi-task distributed learning in the field of medical imaging.      
### 71.Optimizing the Long-Term Behaviour of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Pushing and Grasping  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03487.pdf)
>  We investigate the "Visual Pushing for Grasping" (VPG) system by Zeng et al. and the "Hourglass" system by Ewerton et al., an evolution of the former. The focus of our work is the investigation of the capabilities of both systems to learn long-term rewards and policies. Zeng et al. original task only needs a limited amount of foresight. Ewerton et al. attain their best performance using an agent which only takes the most immediate action under consideration. We are interested in the ability of their models and training algorithms to accurately predict long-term Q-Values. To evaluate this ability, we design a new bin sorting task and reward function. Our task requires agents to accurately estimate future rewards and therefore use high discount factors in their Q-Value calculation. We investigate the behaviour of an adaptation of the VPG training algorithm on our task. We show that this adaptation can not accurately predict the required long-term action sequences. In addition to the limitations identified by Ewerton et al., it suffers from the known Deep Q-Learning problem of overestimated Q-Values. In an effort to solve our task, we turn to the Hourglass models and combine them with the Double Q-Learning approach. We show that this approach enables the models to accurately predict long-term action sequences when trained with large discount factors. Our results show that the Double Q-Learning technique is essential for training with very high discount factors, as the models Q-Value predictions diverge otherwise. We also experiment with different approaches for discount factor scheduling, loss calculation and exploration procedures. Our results show that the latter factors do not visibly influence the model's performance for our task.      
### 72.Surface Vision Transformers: Flexible Attention-Based Modelling of Biomedical Surfaces  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03408.pdf)
>  Recent state-of-the-art performances of Vision Transformers (ViT) in computer vision tasks demonstrate that a general-purpose architecture, which implements long-range self-attention, could replace the local feature learning operations of convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we extend ViTs to surfaces by reformulating the task of surface learning as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem, by proposing patching mechanisms for general surface meshes. Sequences of patches are then processed by a transformer encoder and used for classification or regression. We validate our method on a range of different biomedical surface domains and tasks: brain age prediction in the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), fluid intelligence prediction in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and coronary artery calcium score classification using surfaces from the Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart (SCOT-HEART) dataset, and investigate the impact of pretraining and data augmentation on model performance. Results suggest that Surface Vision Transformers (SiT) demonstrate consistent improvement over geometric deep learning methods for brain age and fluid intelligence prediction and achieve comparable performance on calcium score classification to standard metrics used in clinical practice. Furthermore, analysis of transformer attention maps offers clear and individualised predictions of the features driving each task.

### 73.Multi-Sample $ζ$-mixup: Richer, More Realistic Synthetic Samples from a $p$-Series Interpolant  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03323.pdf)
>  Modern deep learning training procedures rely on model regularization techniques such as data augmentation methods, which generate training samples that increase the diversity of data and richness of label information. A popular recent method, mixup, uses convex combinations of pairs of original samples to generate new samples. However, as we show in our experiments, mixup can produce undesirable synthetic samples, where the data is sampled off the manifold and can contain incorrect labels. We propose $\zeta$-mixup, a generalization of mixup with provably and demonstrably desirable properties that allows convex combinations of $N \geq 2$ samples, leading to more realistic and diverse outputs that incorporate information from $N$ original samples by using a $p$-series interpolant. We show that, compared to mixup, $\zeta$-mixup better preserves the intrinsic dimensionality of the original datasets, which is a desirable property for training generalizable models. Furthermore, we show that our implementation of $\zeta$-mixup is faster than mixup, and extensive evaluation on controlled synthetic and 24 real-world natural and medical image classification datasets shows that $\zeta$-mixup outperforms mixup and traditional data augmentation techniques.      
### 74.What You See is What You Get: Distributional Generalization for Algorithm Design in Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03230.pdf)
>  We investigate and leverage a connection between Differential Privacy (DP) and the recently proposed notion of Distributional Generalization (DG). Applying this connection, we introduce new conceptual tools for designing deep-learning methods that bypass "pathologies" of standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD). First, we prove that differentially private methods satisfy a "What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)" generalization guarantee: whatever a model does on its train data is almost exactly what it will do at test time. This guarantee is formally captured by distributional generalization. WYSIWYG enables principled algorithm design in deep learning by reducing $\textit{generalization}$ concerns to $\textit{optimization}$ ones: in order to mitigate unwanted behavior at test time, it is provably sufficient to mitigate this behavior on the train data. This is notably false for standard (non-DP) methods, hence this observation has applications even when privacy is not required. For example, importance sampling is known to fail for standard SGD, but we show that it has exactly the intended effect for DP-trained models. Thus, with DP-SGD, unlike with SGD, we can influence test-time behavior by making principled train-time interventions. We use these insights to construct simple algorithms which match or outperform SOTA in several distributional robustness applications, and to significantly improve the privacy vs. disparate impact trade-off of DP-SGD. Finally, we also improve on known theoretical bounds relating differential privacy, stability, and distributional generalization.      
### 75.MC-UNet Multi-module Concatenation based on U-shape Network for Retinal Blood Vessels Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03213.pdf)
>  Accurate segmentation of the blood vessels of the retina is an important step in clinical diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases. Many deep learning frameworks have come up for retinal blood vessels segmentation tasks. However, the complex vascular structure and uncertain pathological features make the blood vessel segmentation still very challenging. A novel U-shaped network named Multi-module Concatenation which is based on Atrous convolution and multi-kernel pooling is put forward to retinal vessels segmentation in this paper. The proposed network structure retains three layers the essential structure of U-Net, in which the atrous convolution combining the multi-kernel pooling blocks are designed to obtain more contextual information. The spatial attention module is concatenated with dense atrous convolution module and multi-kernel pooling module to form a multi-module concatenation. And different dilation rates are selected by cascading to acquire a larger receptive field in atrous convolution. Adequate comparative experiments are conducted on these public retinal datasets: DRIVE, STARE and CHASE_DB1. The results show that the proposed method is effective, especially for microvessels.

### 76.Convolutional Neural Network for Early Pulmonary Embolism Detection via Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03204.pdf)
>  This study was conducted to develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system for triaging patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). The purpose of the system was to reduce the death rate during the waiting period. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is used for PE diagnosis. Because CTPA reports require a radiologist to review the case and suggest further management, this creates a waiting period during which patients may die. Our proposed CAD method was thus designed to triage patients with PE from those without PE. In contrast to related studies involving CAD systems that identify key PE lesion images to expedite PE diagnosis, our system comprises a novel classification-model ensemble for PE detection and a segmentation model for PE lesion labeling. The models were trained using data from National Cheng Kung University Hospital and open resources. The classification model yielded 0.73 for receiver operating characteristic curve (accuracy = 0.85), while the mean intersection over union was 0.689 for the segmentation model. The proposed CAD system can distinguish between patients with and without PE and automatically label PE lesions to expedite PE diagnosis      
### 77.MDA GAN: Adversarial-Learning-based 3-D Seismic Data Interpolation and Reconstruction for Complex Missing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03197.pdf)
>  The interpolation and reconstruction of missing traces is a crucial step in seismic data processing, moreover it is also a highly ill-posed problem, especially for complex cases such as high-ratio random discrete missing, continuous missing and missing in rich fault or salt body surveys. These complex cases are rarely mentioned in current sparse or low-rank priorbased and deep learning-based approaches. To cope with complex missing cases, we propose Multi-Dimensional Adversarial GAN (MDA GAN), a novel 3-D GAN framework. It employs three discriminators to ensure the consistency of the reconstructed data with the original data distribution in each dimension. The feature splicing module (FSM) is designed and embedded into the generator of this framework, which automatically splices the features of the unmissing part with those of the reconstructed part (missing part), thus fully preserving the information of the unmissing part. To prevent pixel distortion in the seismic data caused by the adversarial learning process, we propose a new reconstruction loss Tanh Cross Entropy (TCE) loss to provide smoother gradients. We experimentally verified the effectiveness of the individual components of the study and then tested the method on multiple publicly available data. The method achieves reasonable reconstructions for up to 95% of random discrete missing, 100 traces of continuous missing and more complex hybrid missing. In surveys of fault-rich and salt bodies, the method can achieve promising reconstructions with up to 75% missing in each of the three directions (98.2% in total).      
### 78.Low-Dose CT Denoising via Sinogram Inner-Structure Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03163.pdf)
>  Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) technique, which reduces the radiation harm to human bodies, is now attracting increasing interest in the medical imaging field. As the image quality is degraded by low dose radiation, LDCT exams require specialized reconstruction methods or denoising algorithms. However, most of the recent effective methods overlook the inner-structure of the original projection data (sinogram) which limits their denoising ability. The inner-structure of the sinogram represents special characteristics of the data in the sinogram domain. By maintaining this structure while denoising, the noise can be obviously restrained. Therefore, we propose an LDCT denoising network namely Sinogram Inner-Structure Transformer (SIST) to reduce the noise by utilizing the inner-structure in the sinogram domain. Specifically, we study the CT imaging mechanism and statistical characteristics of sinogram to design the sinogram inner-structure loss including the global and local inner-structure for restoring high-quality CT images. Besides, we propose a sinogram transformer module to better extract sinogram features. The transformer architecture using a self-attention mechanism can exploit interrelations between projections of different view angles, which achieves an outstanding performance in sinogram denoising. Furthermore, in order to improve the performance in the image domain, we propose the image reconstruction module to complementarily denoise both in the sinogram and image domain.      
### 79.DiffCloud: Real-to-Sim from Point Clouds with Differentiable Simulation and Rendering of Deformable Objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03139.pdf)
>  Research in manipulation of deformable objects is typically conducted on a limited range of scenarios, because handling each scenario on hardware takes significant effort. Realistic simulators with support for various types of deformations and interactions have the potential to speed up experimentation with novel tasks and algorithms. However, for highly deformable objects it is challenging to align the output of a simulator with the behavior of real objects. Manual tuning is not intuitive, hence automated methods are needed. We view this alignment problem as a joint perception-inference challenge and demonstrate how to use recent neural network architectures to successfully perform simulation parameter inference from real point clouds. We analyze the performance of various architectures, comparing their data and training requirements. Furthermore, we propose to leverage differentiable point cloud sampling and differentiable simulation to significantly reduce the time to achieve the alignment. We employ an efficient way to propagate gradients from point clouds to simulated meshes and further through to the physical simulation parameters, such as mass and stiffness. Experiments with highly deformable objects show that our method can achieve comparable or better alignment with real object behavior, while reducing the time needed to achieve this by more than an order of magnitude.

### 80.Late multimodal fusion for image and audio music transcription  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03063.pdf)
>  Music transcription, which deals with the conversion of music sources into a structured digital format, is a key problem for Music Information Retrieval (MIR). When addressing this challenge in computational terms, the MIR community follows two lines of research: music documents, which is the case of Optical Music Recognition (OMR), or audio recordings, which is the case of Automatic Music Transcription (AMT). The different nature of the aforementioned input data has conditioned these fields to develop modality-specific frameworks. However, their recent definition in terms of sequence labeling tasks leads to a common output representation, which enables research on a combined paradigm. In this respect, multimodal image and audio music transcription comprises the challenge of effectively combining the information conveyed by image and audio modalities. In this work, we explore this question at a late-fusion level: we study four combination approaches in order to merge, for the first time, the hypotheses regarding end-to-end OMR and AMT systems in a lattice-based search space. The results obtained for a series of performance scenarios -- in which the corresponding single-modality models yield different error rates -- showed interesting benefits of these approaches. In addition, two of the four strategies considered significantly improve the corresponding unimodal standard recognition frameworks.      
### 81.Fusing finetuned models for better pretraining  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03044.pdf)
>  Pretrained models are the standard starting point for training. This approach consistently outperforms the use of a random initialization. However, pretraining is a costly endeavour that few can undertake. <br>In this paper, we create better base models at hardly any cost, by fusing multiple existing fine tuned models into one. Specifically, we fuse by averaging the weights of these models. We show that the fused model results surpass the pretrained model ones. We also show that fusing is often better than intertraining. <br>We find that fusing is less dependent on the target task. Furthermore, weight decay nullifies intertraining effects but not those of fusing.      
### 82.Statistical Model Criticism of Variational Auto-Encoders  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03030.pdf)
>  We propose a framework for the statistical evaluation of variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and test two instances of this framework in the context of modelling images of handwritten digits and a corpus of English text. Our take on evaluation is based on the idea of statistical model criticism, popular in Bayesian data analysis, whereby a statistical model is evaluated in terms of its ability to reproduce statistics of an unknown data generating process from which we can obtain samples. A VAE learns not one, but two joint distributions over a shared sample space, each exploiting a choice of factorisation that makes sampling tractable in one of two directions (latent-to-data, data-to-latent). We evaluate samples from these distributions, assessing their (marginal) fit to the observed data and our choice of prior, and we also evaluate samples through a pipeline that connects the two distributions starting from a data sample, assessing whether together they exploit and reveal latent factors of variation that are useful to a practitioner. We show that this methodology offers possibilities for model selection qualitatively beyond intrinsic evaluation metrics and at a finer granularity than commonly used statistics can offer.      
### 83.EfficientCellSeg: Efficient Volumetric Cell Segmentation Using Context Aware Pseudocoloring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03014.pdf)
>  Volumetric cell segmentation in fluorescence microscopy images is important to study a wide variety of cellular processes. Applications range from the analysis of cancer cells to behavioral studies of cells in the embryonic stage. Like in other computer vision fields, most recent methods use either large convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformer models (ViTs). Since the number of available 3D microscopy images is typically limited in applications, we take a different approach and introduce a small CNN for volumetric cell segmentation. Compared to previous CNN models for cell segmentation, our model is efficient and has an asymmetric encoder-decoder structure with very few parameters in the decoder. Training efficiency is further improved via transfer learning. In addition, we introduce Context Aware Pseudocoloring to exploit spatial context in z-direction of 3D images while performing volumetric cell segmentation slice-wise. We evaluated our method using different 3D datasets from the Cell Segmentation Benchmark of the Cell Tracking Challenge. Our segmentation method achieves top-ranking results, while our CNN model has an up to 25x lower number of parameters than other top-ranking methods.

### 84.Multi-Scale Memory-Based Video Deblurring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02977.pdf)
>  Video deblurring has achieved remarkable progress thanks to the success of deep neural networks. Most methods solve for the deblurring end-to-end with limited information propagation from the video sequence. However, different frame regions exhibit different characteristics and should be provided with corresponding relevant information. To achieve fine-grained deblurring, we designed a memory branch to memorize the blurry-sharp feature pairs in the memory bank, thus providing useful information for the blurry query input. To enrich the memory of our memory bank, we further designed a bidirectional recurrency and multi-scale strategy based on the memory bank. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while keeping the model complexity and inference time low.

### 85.Follow My Eye: Using Gaze to Supervise Computer-Aided Diagnosis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02976.pdf)
>  When deep neural network (DNN) was first introduced to the medical image analysis community, researchers were impressed by its performance. However, it is evident now that a large number of manually labeled data is often a must to train a properly functioning DNN. This demand for supervision data and labels is a major bottleneck in current medical image analysis, since collecting a large number of annotations from experienced experts can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate that the eye movement of radiologists reading medical images can be a new form of supervision to train the DNN-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Particularly, we record the tracks of the radiologists' gaze when they are reading images. The gaze information is processed and then used to supervise the DNN's attention via an Attention Consistency module. To the best of our knowledge, the above pipeline is among the earliest efforts to leverage expert eye movement for deep-learning-based CAD. We have conducted extensive experiments on knee X-ray images for osteoarthritis assessment. The results show that our method can achieve considerable improvement in diagnosis performance, with the help of gaze supervision.
